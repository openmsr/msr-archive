CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF A CONTINUOUS FLUORINATOR
EXPERIMENTAL FACILITY (CFEF)

R. B. Lindauer
J. R. Hightower, Jr.

ABSTRACT

A conceptual design has been made of a circulating salt
system, consisting principally of a fluorinator and reduc-
tion column, to demonstrate uranium removal from the salt by
fluorination. The fluorinator vessel wall will be protected
from fluorine corrosion by a frozen salt film. The circu-
lating salt in the fluorinator will be kept molten by elec-
trical heating that simulates fission product heating in an
actual MSBR system.

1. INTRODUCTION

The present flowsheet for processing a single-fluid MSBR includes a
fluorination step for continuously removing 99% of the uranium from a salt
stream coming from the reactor at the rate of 3.3 liters/min. The salt
stream passes through a reductive-extraction step for protactinium removal,
and a metal-transfer step for rare-earth removal before being returned to
the reactor. Two smaller fluorination operations are also required for
removing uranium from the secondary salt stream that flows to the prot-
actinium decay tank, and for the periodic recovery of uranium from the

protactinium decay tank.

Operability of a frozen wall fluorinator using autoresistance power
to simulate fission product heating has been tested in three experiments:
AHT-2, AHT-3, and anT-4. 17% In experiment AHT-2, LiF-BeF, salt (67-33
mole 7%) was used in a simple, vertical test vessel with satisfactory
results.’ In AHT-3, successful runs were made using MSBR fuel carrier

salt with the electrode in the vertical test section.’ In AHT-4, MSBR
fuel carrier salt was circulated through the test vessel, which was similar
. 6 . .

to a proposed fluorinator. The electrode was placed in a side arm that

was connected to the vessel near the top of the vertical fluorination

section. No fluorine was used in any of these experiments.

The objective of the continuous fluorinator experimental facility
(CFEF) is to demonstrate the actual fluorination of uranium in a circu-
lating salt system that is similar to AHT-4. The uranium that is not

volatilized, but which is partially oxidized to UF., will be reduced back

5
to UF, in a hydrogen reduction column. This demonstration is expected to
provide information about corrosion protection by the frozen salt film,

and operating experience and process data, including fluorine utilization,

reaction rate, and flow rate effects.
2. SUMMARY

The continuous fluorinator experimental facility will be installed
in a cell in Building 7503 to provide beryllium containment. The system
will contain 8 to 9 £3 (0.23 to 0.25 n>) of MSBR fuel-carrier salt (72-
16-12 mole % LiF-BeF,-ThF ) containing an initial quantity of 0.35 mole
Z of uranium. The salt will be circulated at up to 100% of MSBR flow
rate (3.3 liters/min). Because of the short fluorination height and
depending on operating conditions, the uranium that is volatilized will
range between 80% and 95%. The variables of salt flow rate, fluorine
flow rate, and fluorine concentration will be studied by measuring the
UF, concentration in the fluorinator off-gas stream, and by sampling the
salt stream after reduction of UF, to UF,. Mass flowmeters in the fluori-

nator off-gas stream before and after the NaF traps will provide a con-

tinuous indication of the uranium volatilization rate.

Fluorine utilization can be calculated from the final mass flowmeter

reading and the fluorine feed rate. The amount of UF, in the stream

going to the reduction column can be determined from the fluorine utili-

zation and UF, volatilization rates. Another mass flowmeter in the gas

stream coming from the reduction column will indicate the unreacted
hydrogen plus the HF which is formed. The reduction efficiency can be
calculated from this reading. The fluorinator will have two fluorine
inlets to provide data for determining the column end effects. Reduction
of UF, will be carried out in a gas lift in which hydrogen will be used

as the driving gas and also as the reductant. If additional reduction

is required, it can be done in the salt surge tank. The surge tank is
designed to provide sufficient salt inventory for about 4 hr of fluorina-
tion under operating conditions which result in 80% uranium volatilization
per pass, and 11 hr of fluorination under conditions which result in 95%

uranium volatilization per pass. About 99% of the uranium should have

been removed from the salt batch after these periods of time.
3. DESIGN DESCRIPTION

The flowsheet is shown in Fig. 1. Salt will enter the fluorinator
through the electrode in a side arm. The electrode flange will be insu-
lated electrically from the rest of the fluorinator, and the autoresistance
power will be connected to a lug on the flange. The salt will leave at
the bottom of the fluorinator below the fluorine inlet side arm. The
fluorinator pipe wall will be cooled by external air-water coils to form
the frozen salt film, which serves the dual purpose of preventing nickel
corrosion and autoresistance current shorting. Below the fluorine inlet,
the fluorinator wall will not be cooled and the molten salt will complete
the electrical circuit to the vessel wall. Since all of the uranium will
not be volatilized, some partially oxidized uranium will be found as UF
at the bottom of the fluorinator. The fluorinator bottom, exit line, and
reduction column will be protected from the highly corrosive UF, by gold
lining (or plating). The molten salt containing UF, will enter at the
bottom of the column where it will be contacted with hydrogen. The hydro-
gen will be introduced into the column through a palladium tube; this will
result in the formation of atomic hydrogen, which greatly increases the
reduction rate of UF, to UF, . The hydrogen reduction column will also
act as a gas lift to raise the salt to a gas-liquid separator. The salt

will then flow by gravity to the fluorinator through a salt sampler,

surge tank, heat flowmeter, and electrical circuit-breaking pot. The surge
tank will have a working volume of 5 fed (0.14 nd), and a dip tube through
which hydrogen can be introduced if further uranium reduction is required.
Reduction off-gas from the separator and surge tank that contains HF and
excess hydrogen will pass through a NaF bed for removal of the HF. The
excess hydrogen will be diluted below the explosive limit before being

discharged to the cell off-gas.

Off-gas from the fluorinator will contain UF, and excess fluorine;
argon will also be in the off-gas if it is used to dilute the fluorine.
The gas will pass through two sodium fluoride beds for uranium removal.
Hastings mass flowmeters will be installed upstream and downstream from
the beds. The difference between the two readings is a measure of the
UF, flow rate. This provides an instantaneous and reasonably accurate
means for determining the fluorine utilization and reaction rate. An
engineering layout of the equipment to be installed in the spare equip-

ment cell in Building 7503 is shown in ref. 7. A description of the

individual equipment items follows.

Fluorinator. This vessel (Fig. 2) is similar to the test vessel
used in experiments AHT-3 and AHT-4; however, several changes have been
made based on operating experience. The diameter of the entire vessel
was increased from 6 to 8 in. (0.15 to 0.20 m) to simplify frozen-film
formation and to provide space for a thicker film, thus minimizing the
effect of nonuniform film thickness. The heated jacket over the electrode
was lengthened to reduce the danger of the salt freezing in the unheated
end. Fluorination zones of 3 and 6 ft (0.9 and 1.8 m) are provided by
having two fluorine inlets. Since complete fluorination is not expected,
and UF (which is very corrosive) will be present in the salt below the
fluorine inlet, it will be necessary to cool all five jackets regardless
of whether the 3-ft or 6-ft (0.9 or 1.8 m) fluorinator is being used.

The bottom of the fluorinator and the line to the reduction column will
be protected from corrosion by a gold lining. Contact between the molten
salt and this lining will complete the electrical circuit for autoresis-

tance heating.

Alternative fluorinator designs (to the autoresistance heated unit

shown) are being considered for the CFEF. The salt core could be kept

molten by the use of a jacketed axial heater in the center of the fluori-
nator. Although corrosion would be severe (probably ~ 0.03 mm/hr), at
least 100 hr of fluorination should be possible before the jacket fails
and/or the salt is saturated with NiF, (v 0.9 wt %). It would also be
possible to supply sufficient heat in the entering salt so that the salt
leaving the bottom of the fluorinator will not be cooled below the liquidus
temperature. Figure 3 shows, for example, that the heat loss through a
1-in.- (25-mm) thick salt film could be compensated by a salt temperature
drop of 40°C (inlet-exit) at one-half the MSBR salt flow rate if a 400°C-

pipe wall temperature is desired.

There are disadvantages to these two alternative designs. Corrosion
of the axial heater jacket would consume fluorine and prevent the accurate
calculation of fluorine utilization in the uranium-fluorine reaction.
Without knowing the fluorine consumption in the oxidation of uranium it
would not be possible to calculate the amount of UF formed. If no inter-
nal salt heating is used, the high inlet salt temperature that is required
could cause difficulty in forming and maintaining a salt film near the
electrode. In any case, the salt film would probably be less uniform

than with internal heating, because the film would be thinner near the

salt inlet and thicker near the salt outlet.

Reduction column. Since the reduction column also functions as a
gas-1ift to provide salt circulation, the diameter, height, and elevation
will be determined primarily by the gas—-1lift design. The salt head in
the fluorinator will determine the gas-1ift submergence (about 50%),
and the salt circulation rate (1 to 3 liters/min) will determine the
column diameter. The entire column height will probably not be required

to accomplish complete reduction of UF The palladium catalyst at the

5°
hydrogen inlet should provide adequate reduction with a small contact
height. The column will be lined or plated with gold to prevent corro-

sive attack by the UF If additional reduction is required, hydrogen

5
could be supplied easily through a dip tube in the surge tank to com-
plete the reaction there; however, corrosion from UF could be a problem

since there are no plans to gold line this tank.

Fig. 3. Heat loss from a fluorinator through several thicknesses
of frozen salt film as a function of fluorinator wall temperature.
Horizontal lines show heat removal from salt flowing through the
fluorinator at 1.7 liters per minute [1/2 the processing rate for a
1000-MW(e) MSBR] for the indicated salt temperature change.
Surge and drain tanks. Before being returned to the fluorinator, the
salt will pass through a 5-ft3 (0. 14-m>) surge tank to provide salt inven-
tory. This tank will have a baffle to prevent short circuiting of salt
flow from inlet to outlet. Salt overflows from a side outlet, the level

of which determines the tank capacity.

The drain tank is similar to the surge tank in size and design and
has sufficient capacity to contain the salt volume of the test vessel and
reduction column. It will be necessary to drain these vessels periodi-
cally for inspection and possible maintenance. The drain tank will be
subjected to the greatest pressure in the entire system when salt is
transferred back to the circulating system. Design of this vessel must

therefore be approved by the ORNL Pressure Vessel Review Committee.

HF trap. The off-gas from the gas-liquid separator and the surge
tank will contain HF and excess hydrogen from the UF, reduction step.
This gas is passed through a NaF bed. The bed depth is 3.3 ft (1.0 m),
and has a calculated pressure drop of 0.15 psi (1034 kPa) with a gas flow
rate of 1 cfm (4.7 x 107% m/sec). The bed has the capacity to absorb
the HF evolved from 1.3-fuel salt batches containing 0.35 mole 7 uranium,
assuming no UF, evolution (all UF, is converted to UF, and is reduced by
hydrogen to UF,). Since absorption is poor at high temperatures, the gas
from the reduction step is cooled to 100°C before it enters the trap.
Cooling the gas to below 100°C at the inlet would result in a high partial
pressure of HF (probably ~ 20%), which would form the higher HF complexes
(NaF.2HF, NaF-.3HF, etc.) and cause plugging. A cooler is provided on the

bed exit to improve absorption at that point and prevent HF release.

UF, traps. The absorbers for collecting the UF, on NaF pellets are
made of carbon steel that is sufficiently resistant to fluorine corrosion
at low temperatures. Surplus absorbers from the MSRE fuel processing will
be used. One of these absorbers, having a bed depth of 10 in. (0.25 m),
contains 24 kg of NaF and has a capacity of about 15 kg of uranium. Less
than 10 kg of uranium is contained in 8 fi (0.23 mn) of fuel salt. The

absorbers are designed with an open 2-in. (51-mm) center pipe for air
10

cooling, although this was not found to be necessary in MSRE operation.

The UF, flow rate is expected to be much lower in the CFEF.

Sampler. The salt will be sampled after it leaves the reduction
column and the gas-liquid separator, and before it enters the surge tank.
The sample will be analyzed for total uranium and the oxidation state
will not affect the results. The sampler is of the same design that has
been used successfully for many years. It is the only piece of equipment
extending through the containment cover over the cell. Local ventilation

will be required to prevent spread of beryllium contamination.

Circuit-breaking pot. In order to minimize the equipment operating

 

at the autoresistance potential (up to 200 V), a pot will be inserted
between the heat flowmeter and the electrode-salt inlet pipe in the
fluorinator. In this pot, the salt stream will impinge on a horizontal
disk causing a salt spray that breaks the electrical circuit. As shown
on the flowsheet (Fig. 1), the pot and fluorinator both have insulated
flanges so that only the pot and fluorinator top flange will be at high

potential.

Heat flowmeter. The salt leaving the surge tank will pass through a
28-in. (0.71-m) section of 2-in. nickel pipe containing a cartridge
heater. Heat loss from the flowmeter will be balanced by external
heaters. The salt flow rate can be calculated from the temperature rise
of the salt as it passes through the flowmeter and the known power input

of the cartridge heater.

3.1 Fluorine Supply System

The fluorine supply system that was used in processing the MSRE fuel
salt will be reactivated for use with the CFEF.” The system (Fig. 4) has
provisions for the connection of two 18-std-m> fluorine trailers with
safety controls to limit the maximum flow rate and to remotely stop the
flow in case of a leak. A NaF trap is available to remove HF from the
fluorine. The HF could cause plugging of the UF, absorbers by formation
of complexes of NaF with two or more molecules of HF. The bed inlet is

heated to prevent the formation of these complexes in the trap. Fluorine

flow is controlled by means of a control valve and an orifice flowmeter.

3.2 Fluorine Disposal System

The CFEF will be the first test of the frozen-wall fluorinator using
fluorine. A vertical scrubber is being installed in Building 7503 for
the disposal of the excess fluorine. A flow diagram of the system is
shown in Fig. 5. The scrubber is a 6-in., 8-ft- (2.4-m) high Monel pipe
with three spray nozzles in the upper half of the vessel. The surge tank
contains 200 gal (0.76 n’) of an aqueous solution containing 15 wt 7% KOH
and 5 wt %Z KI. This equipment is designed to be able to dispose of one
trailer of fluorine (18 std n°) at a flow rate of 30 slm. The KOH solu-
tion will be circulated through the spray nozzles at a maximum total flow
rate of 15 gpm (9.5 x 107% m/sec). The fluorinator off-gas stream will
flow cocurrent to this stream. The scrubber exit stream will pass through

a photometric analyzer for monitoring the efficiency of the scrubber.

4. OPERATING PROCEDURE

After the system has been leak tested, all salt-containing equipment
and piping will be purged with argon and heated to 600°C. All heaters
and thermocouples will be checked after the system has been held at this
temperature for several hours. MSBR fuel salt will then be charged to
the surge tank. Approximately 65 liters will overflow through the flow-
meter and circuit-breaking pot to the fluorinator. After the level is
equalized in the reduction column, the salt will fill the fluorinator to
several inches above normal operating level. The liquid-level recorders
in the fluorinator and surge tank can be checked for operability during

this operation.

Argon will be introduced to the bottom of the reduction column at
a low rate; the rate will be increased until the salt begins to circu-
late as indicated by a drop in the fluorinator liquid level, an increase
in the gas-liquid separator liquid level, and a temperature difference
across the heat flowmeter. The argon flow will be increased stepwise to
obtain data of salt flow rate vs argon flow rate. The liquid level in

the fluorinator and separator will be observed during this test. If the

fluorinator liquid level is too high at the normal salt flow rate, some
salt will be removed to the drain tank. This can be done by thawing the
freeze valve below the surge tank, closing the system vent valve, and

opening the drain-tank vent valve to the cell. The system will be pres-
surized by the purge rotameters to transfer the required amount of salt

from the surge tank to the drain tank.

After adjusting the salt inventory, salt circulation will be started
again, and temperatures in the fluorinator will be adjusted to 530°C.
Lines and other equipment can be maintained between 530°C and 600°C.

Heat to the test section of the fluorinator will be turned off and cooling
air and water turned on. The autoresistance power will be turned on at
very low voltage (less than 1 V) and the resistance can be calculated
periodically from the current measurement as the cooling proceeds. Coolant
rates to the different zones will be adjusted to keep pipe wall tempera-
tures as uniform as possible. When all pipe wall temperatures are less
than 350°C, the resistance of the salt from the electrode to the bottom

of the fluorinator will have increased considerably. The autoresistance
power will be increased until the resistance of the salt and the wall

temperatures become steady.

Following this step, the autoresistance power will be changed, and
equilibrium resistance and temperature will be determined for a range of
powers to determine the operating range of the system. The argon flow
rate to the fluorinator gas inlet (normally the fluorine flow) will be
varied to determine the effect on operability and film thickness, as
indicated by wall temperature and salt resistance. In addition, the salt
flow rate will be varied to determine the operable range, and the sampler

will be inspected before fluorine is used.

After the system has operated reliably at various salt and argon flow
rates and the operable autoresistance power range has been ascertained,
the argon to the column will be replaced with hydrogen to determine what
effect, if any, the gas density has on the operability of the gas 1lift.
Argon to the fluorinator will then be replaced by fluorine. Mass flow-

meter readings taken upstream and downstream from the NaF traps will
15

indicate the evolution of UF 3 salt samples will be taken periodically for
additional data on the fluorination reaction rate. Runs will be made at
various fluorine flow rates, fluorine concentrations, and salt flow rates.
After good operation has been demonstrated under different conditions,

the salt film thickness will be checked by radiography. The freeze valve
below the fluorinator will be thawed and salt circulation and autoresis-
tance power stopped as soon as flow to the drain tank begins. Heat will

be turned off the fluorinator and radiographs will be taken of the cooled

zones,

5. MAINTENANCE

5.1 Maintenance Philosophy

Most components of the system such as the salt storage and drain
tanks, separator, sampler, and traps will be designed and constructed
for a long, maintenance-free service life. The fluorinator and reduction
column may be replaced with equipment of alternate design depending on
operating performance. All components of the system will be accessible

for possible repair or replacement.

5.2 Preventive Maintenance

The operating temperature of the system will be closely controlled
to prevent hot spots that could cause heater burnout. Resistance heaters
are to be operated at one-half the design voltage to prolong their usage.
Chemical analyses will be made of the salt (especially for NiF,) to detect
unusual corrosion. The facility will be checked regularly to detect
incipient failure of parts of the system, and appropriate maintenance

measures will be taken.

6. STANDARDS AND QUALITY ASSURANCE

6.1 Codes and Standards

The vessels and piping will be fabricated in accordance with the

requirements specified in Sect. VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel
16

Code and Pressure Piping Code. ORNL MET material specifications and ORNL

Weld Procedure Specifications will be used for construction of the vessels
and piping. Because of its location at the bottom of the cell, it will

be subjected to the highest pressures in the system; therefore, the design
must be reviewed by the ORNL Pressure Vessel Review Committee. Details

of this vessel are shown in ref. 10.

6.2 Quality Assurance

Quality level III and IV (QL-3) quality assurance standards as out-
lined in "Quality Assurance Program Planning for Small Research and
Development Projects,’ QA-CT-1-109, will be applied in constructing the

facility.
