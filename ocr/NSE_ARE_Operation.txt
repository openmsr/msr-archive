The ARE was operated successfully in November, 1954, at various power levels up to 2.5
MWt. The maximum steady-state fuel temperature was 1580°F (1130 K), and there was a
differential temperature between the inlet and outlet in the NaF-ZrF4-UF4 fuel of 355°F (200 K).
The fuel system was in operation for 241 hr before the reactor first became critical and the nuclear
operation extended over a period of 221 hr. The final 74 hr of operation were in the megawatt
range and resulted in the production of 96 MW-hr of nuclear energy. Effects of various transient
conditions on reactor operation were determined.

The specific objective of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment (ARE) was to build and operate a
high-temperature low-power circulating-fuel reactor of materials which would be suitable for a
high-power reactor. As described in the preceding papers (1,2), the fuel for the reactor
experiment was a mixture of the fluorides of sodium, zirconium, and uranium, which was
circulated through passages within the reactor and then to an external heat sink. Inconel was
employed both as the fuel container and the structural metal, and a sodium system was provided
in order to cool the reflector and container—regions of the reactor from which the fuel was
excluded.

The reactor was designed to operate at a maximum temperature of 1500°F (1090 K) with a
350°F (200 K) temperature rise in the fuel as it circulated through the reactor. The power was to
be in excess of 1 MW and the operation was scheduled to be terminated after 100 MW-hr had
been accumulated. Experimental data on reactor operation, in particular data on temperature
coefficients, critical mass, xenon poisoning, and response to changes in reactor operating
conditions, were to be obtained.

The ARE achieved criticality on November 3, 1954, and reached the megawatt range some
six days later; following completion of the experimental program in three more days the
experiment was terminated. The nuclear operation of this reactor is, however, only a part of the
operating history. Since the nuclear operation was particularly dependent upon the integrity and
performance of the liquid sodium and liquid salt systems at high temperatures, the operating
period of the ARE was defined as the period that began when these systems were filled and
ended when they were drained.

OPERATION PRELIMINARY TO CRITICALITY
Operation of the ARE was moderately complex; however, the complexity of the system and

much of the instrumentation were the result of a desire to learn as much as possible from this
first attempt to operate a reactor with a circulating fluoride fuel and must not be considered as

obtained from the list of equipment, valves, and instrumentation presented in Table 1.

Since both sodium and the fluoride fuel are solid at room temperature, both liquid systems
had to be preheated at least to above the melting points of these materials before the systems
could be filled. The entire system was first electrically heated to a temperature of 600°F (590
K), and sodium was transferred from portable containers into the fill-and-drain tanks. The
sodium was then pressurized from these tanks into the operating system and circulated.
Although such filling operations are now regarded as routine, the difficulties which had been
experienced up to that time caused this operation to be regarded as a milestone in the conduct of
the experiment.

With the sodium system operating, the reactor and the fuel system were heated to 1200°F
(920 K), at which time the fuel fill tanks were filled with molten NaF - ZrF, from portable
containers. The several parallel serpentine fuel passages in the core would not permit the fuel
system to be filled by pressurizing the fluoride mixture from the fill tanks into the operating
portion of the system unless the latter were evacuated. Thus, although the fuel system could be
vacuum filled, it would not drain completely nor could it be conveniently refilled. Therefore it
was necessary that the system be filled properly the first time and remain filled until the
completion of operation. The vacuum fill was effected without difficulty, and this system as a
whole performed exceptionally well throughout the experiment. The fuel system drain valves
did not leak, and, except for a few thermocouples and the fuel flowmeter, which behaved
erratically toward the end of the experiment, all instruments performed satisfactorily.

ENRICHING TO CRITICALITY

With the sodium and fuel circulating, the reactor was ready for the introduction of the
fissionable material. In order to make the reactor critical, uranium in the form of molten
2NaF-UF, was added in discrete quantities to the barren carrier, NaF-ZrF4. The fuel at initial
criticality was approximately 52.8 mole % NaF, 41 mole % ZrF,4, and 5.7 mole % UF, and it
had a melting point of 990°F (805 K); whereas the final fuel mixture, which had a melting point
of 1000°F (810 K) and which included excess uranium, was composed of 53.09 mole % NaF,
40.73 mole % ZrF4, and 6.18 mole % UF,.

It was initially intended to remotely add the fuel concentrate to the system from a large tank
which was to contain all the concentrate, after first passing it through an intermediate transfer
tank. This method was discarded when temperature control and continuous weight-measuring
instrumentation on the transfer tank proved to be unsatisfactory. Instead, a less elaborate and
more direct method of concentrate addition was employed that is shown schematically in Figure
1. The enrichment operation involved the successive connection of numerous small concentrate
containers to an intermediate transfer pot, which was in turn connected to the fuel system by a
line which discharged the concentrate into the pump above the liquid level. Each of the
concentrate containers was weighed before and after being emptied in order to determine the
amount of uranium transferred into the fuel system. The concentrate was first taken from cans
containing from 2 1b (1 kg) (for rod calibration) up to 33 1b (15 kg) (for the first subcritical
loadings). In this enrichment operation the pump bowl served as a mixing chamber, and after 5
or 6 cycles through the fuel system the concentrate became uniformly distributed in the
circulating stream.

While the first concentrate addition was made on October 30, the reactor did not become
critical until three days later (3:45 PM, November 3). Most of the intervening time was spent in
clearing the transfer line of plugs or in repairing leaks in the transfer lines. Both the plugs and
the leaks were the result of the temporary nature of the enrichment system.

Count rates were taken after each fuel addition and at various shim rod positions that
provided a measure of the shim rod worth and charted the approach to criticality. The resultant
curve (Figure 2) shows the multiplication factor, k or [1 — (1/M)], as a function of the addition of
fuel in pounds of *’U per cubic foot of fuel mixture. The subcritical multiplication was
determined from the expression M = N/N, , where N is the count rate after a concentrate
injection and Nj is the initial count rate. The data from three different ionization chambers are
presented: meters No. 1 and. No. 2 were fission chambers located in the reflector, and the BeF3
counter was located external to the reactor at the midplane of the cylindrical side. The unique
shape of these curves (which when first extrapolated suggested a much lower critical mass than
was actually required) is believed to be due to the particular radial flux distribution of the reactor
at the location of the chambers and the change in this distribution as criticality was approached.
At 3:45 PM on November 3, upon the completion of the twelfth enrichment operation, a
sustaining chain reaction was attained.

235 CONCENTRATION IN FUEL (Ib/f15}

FIGURE 2: Approach to criticality.
The calculated volume of the carrier in the fuel system (before concentrate addition) was 4.82
ft’ (0.136 m®). (The only significant check on this value was obtained from subsequent analyses
of fuel samples together with the known amounts of concentrate added.) The total amount of
2U added to the system in order to make the reactor critical was approximately 135 1b (61.2
kg), but small amounts were withdrawn from the system for samples and in trimming the pump
level. The *°U concentration at criticality was 23.9 1b/ft’ (383 kg/m’), and, since the calculated
volume of the 1300°F (980 K) core was 1.37 ft’ (388 L), the "cold" clean critical mass of the
reactor was 32.75 Ib (14.85 kg) of ’U (2).

LOW-POWER EXPERIMENTS

Several experiments were performed with the critical reactor at low power, including reactor
power calibration and rod calibrations. In addition, the effects of the process system parameters
on reactivity were noted, a preliminary measurement of the temperature coefficient was
undertaken, and a radiation survey was made. These tests commenced during the morning of
November 4 and were completed by noon on November 8.

FIGURE 3: Low-power measurement of temperature coefficient.

The regulating rod was calibrated both by the addition of fuel and by observing the resultant
pile period (as derived from the inhour equation) upon withdrawing the rod. The value of the
rod was first obtained by noting the amount of rod insertion required to maintain a constant
power level as a finite amount of fuel was added to the system. This information, together with
all experimental value of 0.236 for the mass reactivity coefficient permitted a determination of
the value of the rod that was subsequently validated by the period calibration derived from the
inhour equation. This mass reactivity coefficient had been previously determined from
measurements taken during the critical experiment. The modification of the inhour equation as a
result of fuel circulation is described in the preceding paper (2).

While the reactor power was first estimated from the fission chamber counting rate, attempts
were made to confirm this estimate by operating the clean reactor at some low power for a 1-hr
period and then withdrawing a fuel sample for a count of its activity. This calibration was
attempted first at an estimated power of 1 W and then at 10 W. The activity of the fuel sample
taken after the 1-hr run at 1 W was too low to count accurately, but that of the sample taken after
the 1-hr run at 10 W indicated that the power was 13.5 W. The nuclear instrumentation was then
calibrated on this basis. It was subsequently learned that many of the gaseous fission products
were apparently being continuously removed from the fuel at the pump (2), and, consequently,
the actual power was greater than that indicated by the fuel sample analysis. All power
measurements therefore were subject to a correction which was subsequently determined from a
heat balance at high power.

The sign of the reactor temperature coefficient was determined to be negative both when the
reactor was suberitical and again during low-power operation. The data from the low-power
measurement of the temperature coefficient are presented in Figure 3, with the regulating rod
position superimposed on the fuel mean temperature chart. For this experiment the rod position
was controlled by a flux servo as heat was removed from the fuel. A more accurate
determination of the magnitude of the temperature coefficient was deferred until the high-power
runs. It was, however, only after this positive demonstration of a good negative temperature
coefficient that the reactor was brought to power.

HIGH-POWER EXPERIMENT

The reactor was finally taken to high power (approximately 1 MW) at 6:20 PM, November 9,
six days after it first became critical. The high power level was attained after a 30-hr period of
intermittent operation during which there were periods of operation with power levels of 10 kW,
100 kW, 500 kW, and finally 1 MW. With the heat barrier doors opened, power was attained, as
anticipated, merely by increasing the speed of the blower which cooled the fuel heat exchanger.
Full power could have been obtained at once except for the natural tendency to proceed slowly
into an unfamiliar regime—a fortunate decision, since there was some leakage of gaseous
activity from the vent system into the pit and subsequently into the building atmosphere. Further
difficulty from this source was circumvented by operating the pit at sub-atmospheric pressures
and remotely exhausting the pit gases to the atmosphere where they were adequately dispersed,
as previously described by Bettis et al. (1).

Once power was attained the reactor was operated intermittently and at various power levels
during the next several days as required to complete the desired tests. These tests included
measurement of the various temperature coefficients of reactivity, as described in the preceding
paper by Ergen et al. (2), a reactor power calibration from the process instrumentation, and a
determination of the effect of specific reactor operating conditions, and the tests were concluded
by a 25-hr run at full power to determine whether there was any detectable buildup of xenon.
Incidental to these prescribed tests, the response of the reactor to various transient states,
including severe power cycling, was determined.

Although the reactor power level had been calibrated against the activity count of a fuel
sample, the actual reactor power remained in doubt throughout the experiment, not only because
of uncertainty regarding the retention of fission products by the fuel but also because of
discrepancies in heat balances in the process systems; i... heat removed from fuel and sodium
versus heat picked up in their water heat dumps. The most reliable estimate of the reactor power
proved to be that obtained from the temperature differentials and flows in the fuel and sodium
systems. During one typical period of power operation the fuel temperature differential of 370°F
at 45 gpm accounted for approximately 1.9 MW in the fuel, while the sodium temperature
differential of 115°F at 150 gpm accounted for another approximately 0.6 MW in the sodium,
with a resultant total reactor power in excess of 2.5 MW. During this 2.5-MW operation the fuel
leaving the reactor was at a steady-state temperature of 1580°F and in transients was at a
temperature in. excess of 1620°F.

7, REACTOR MEAN TEMPERATURE (°F}

FIGURE 4: High-power measurement of temperature coefficient.

The temperature coefficient of reactivity was determined by two methods. First the
regulating rod was placed on the flux servo and then the speed of the blower for cooling the fuel
was increased. The change of rod position (converted into reactivity) divided by the change in
the reactor mean temperature determined the reactor temperature coefficient. Since the initial
reactor power at the start of this experiment was only 200 kW, the data were very similar to
those from measurements made during the low-power tests described above.

The second determination was also started with the reactor at a steady-state power of 200 kW.
The servo demand signal of the regulating rod was then set for some value higher than this
steady state and a shim rod was withdrawn sufficiently to permit the servo to take over control of
the regulating rod. The control system required that the demand signal be approximately equal
to the actual flux before the servo could be actuated. Withdrawing the shim rod provided this
condition. With the servo controlling the regulating rod position to maintain the flux constant
the power produced was in excess of that removed by the blowers. This unbalance in power
caused the reactor mean temperature to rise, which in turn caused the regulating rod to be
withdrawn. The increment in reactivity provided by withdrawal of the regulating rod divided by
the increment in mean temperature determined the temperature coefficient. A plot of the
regulating rod withdrawal as a function of the reactor mean temperature, as determined by the
second method, is shown in Figure 4. The slope of the initial segment is proportional to the fuel
temperature coefficient and the slope of the second segment is proportional to the overall reactor
temperature coefficient. From these data a fuel temperature coefficient of -10™ (Ak/k)/°F and an
over-all reactor temperature coefficient of —6 x 10” (Ak/k)/°F were determined. This test is
believed to have provided the best measurement of the fuel and reactor temperature coefficients,
because it is not contingent upon the time lags and inaccuracies inherent in the determination of
increasing extracted power.

? Because of the loose coupling from the speed controller to the fuel system, Ak/k was not very sensitive to the rate
at which the blower speed was changed.

® The controls provided could change the pump speeds from design to zero in a few seconds. However, it was an
established operating practice to limit this time to approximately 30 sec on the few occasions that such changes
were made.

 

A thorough understanding of control processes in a circulating-fuel reactor with a negative
temperature coefficient is necessary for an appreciation of the kinetic behavior of such a power
reactor in the power regime. An important purpose of the ARE was the observation of the
kinetic behavior of the reactor under power coupling to its load when perturbations in the
reactivity were introduced. The various ways in which transient states. may be introduced into
the reactor are shown in Table 2, together with the calculated rates of introduction of Ak/k into
the reactor. As may be seen, stopping the sodium flow had a very small, although observable,
effect. No attempt was made during high-power operation to stop the fuel flow because of the
danger of freezing fuel in the heat exchanger, although the result of flow stoppage can be
calculated from the in-hour curves and the known change of fuel pump speed. The effects on the
ARE of other operating changes are discussed below.

The reactor and system were relatively sluggish in responding to demands at high power.
Furthermore, it was observed that the response at low power (less than 1 kW) was much
different from the response at higher powers (greater than 100 kW). In order to examine the
behavior of the reactor the parameter of interest was plotted against the initial power as various
changes in operating conditions were introduced.

One of the properties investigated was the reactor period, and some of the observed reactor
periods are plotted as a function of the initial power in Figure 5. Since the reactor could be put
on any period from infinite to a given minimum, the points in Figure 5 are scattered. Most of the
longer periods represent those observed during such times as the initial rise to power, which was
approached with caution. As the operators became more familiar with operation at power,
deliberate attempts were made to see how fast a period the reactor would attain due to blower
operation or rod movement. As a result, definite lower limits were established beyond which
reactor periods could not be induced by the controls available to the operator. The solid line in
Figure 5 represents the lower limit for periods during blower operation and the dashed line is
that corresponding to shim and regulating rod movement. If the reactor had been taken to power
with the shim rods inserted to greater depths, smaller periods would have been observed for
shim rod motion than are represented by the dashed line, since the reactivity value of the rods
would have been greater for those insertions. The smallest period observed during high-power
operation was a 10-sec period obtained by increasing the fuel helium blower speed from 0 to 500
rpm at its maximum rate of increase. A few smaller periods were observed in the very low-
power regime just above critical. The two lines shown in Figure 5 indicate that the lower the
power the smaller the period that a given effect can produce; i.e., the higher the power, the
harder it becomes to introduce a short period. Extrapolation of the solid line to a power of 1 kW
indicates that, at this power, reactor periods of 1 sec or less could have been introduced by
blower operation. It is noted that the control system would have automatically inserted the shim
rods had a 5-sec period been obtained, and would have scrammed the reactor had a period less
than 3 sec been obtained. Similar curves were obtained for the rates of temperature change as a
result of various operating changes as a function of initial reactor power.

FIGURE 5: Induced reactor periods as a function of initial reactor power.

Some very general observations on the transient-state behavior of the ARE are summarized in
the following and illustrated in Figure 6.

Reactor periods—In general, the lower the initial power the faster was the transient period
introduced by any type of operation that resulted in upsetting the equilibrium between nuclear
and extracted power. The smaller periods were associated with lower initial powers.
Oscillation of reactor power—When the power level of the reactor was perturbed, the
characteristic behavior of the reactor was to overshoot the new power level and then oscillate
about a mean value before settling down to that level. The period of the oscillation appeared to
be of the order of 2 min and lasted for about 2 cycles.

FIGURE 6: Typical reactor behavior during power operation.

Movement of rods—The reactor was always more prompt to respond to rod motion than it
was to blower operation. Also the reactor periods observed at a given power were smaller for
rod movement than for blower operation. During rod movement at a given demand power, the
extracted power remained essentially constant. Any unbalance between extracted and nuclear
power resulted in a change of the mean reactor temperature.

Nuclear power—Whenever the blower speed was raised, the nuclear power rose (with
oscillations as noted above) to a higher power level than the corresponding extracted power
demand. When rod movement occurred, the nuclear power changed considerably and a higher
or lower reactor overall temperature resulted; the nuclear power then leveled out to a new
balance with the extracted power at about the original power level.

Extracted power—The extracted power was essentially a function only of the demand and
changed when a change occurred in operation of one of the various heat exchanger blowers. A
change in the extracted power would cause oscillations in the mean reactor temperature, after
which the original value of the mean temperature would be re-established. The amount of heat
input to the fuel from reactor inlet to outlet would increase or decrease depending upon whether
the blower speed was raised or lowered.
Reactor outlet fuel temperature—The outlet fuel temperature always rose and fell in the same
direction as the nuclear power level. For blower operation changes, the rise in the outlet
temperature was always less than the fall of the inlet temperature. The opposite was true for
regulating rod movement.

Reactor inlet fuel temperature—The inlet fuel temperature rose and fell in the opposite
direction to the change in nuclear power during blower operation and in the same direction as the
nuclear power during rod movements. The inlet temperature change was greater than the outlet
temperature change for blower operation.

Reactor mean temperature—The reactor mean temperature, as such, was not measured. An
average of reactor inlet and outlet temperatures was continuously recorded as the reactor mean
temperature. Since this was the average of these two temperatures, its value deviated in a
manner compatible with its two components.

Time lags—The system was very sluggish because of the long transit time (47 sec) of the
fuel. There were time lags between the responses of temperature-indicating instruments in
different portions of the system for the same action. These lags were of the order of 2 min for
low-power operation (less than 1 kW) and of the order of 1 min for full-power operation in the
megawatt range.

The last scheduled experiment to be conducted on the reactor was a measurement of the
xenon buildup during a 25-hr run at full power. The amount of xenon buildup was to be
observed by the amount the regulating rod had to be withdrawn in order to maintain a constant
power level. However, during the 25-hr power run the regulating rod was withdrawn only 0.3
in., and thus there was no indication that xenon had remained in the fuel (2).

The scheduled tests were completed by 8:00 AM, November 12. During the 12-hr period
starting 8:00 AM, November 12, until 8:00 that evening, the reactor was brought to full power
and returned to low power some 21 times. The resulting temperature cycling was probably as
severe as that to which any power reactor need be subjected. At 8:00 PM, having completed the
scheduled experimental program and having logged approximately 100 MW-hr, the reactor was
shut down for the last time. The following morning, the fuel and then the sodium, both of which
continued to circulate overnight, were dumped into their respective dump tanks.

Subsequent analysis of the data revealed a total power production of 96 MW-hr. This
analysis also showed that the fuel and sodium systems had been in operation for a total of 462
and 635 hr, respectively, including 221 hr of nuclear operation, with the final 74 hr in the
megawatt range.
