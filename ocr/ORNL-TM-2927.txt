CONTROL STUDIES OF A 1000 - Mw(e) MSBR

W. H. Sides, Jr. MASTER

ABSTRACT

Preliminary studies of the dynamics and control of a 1000-Mw(e), single~
fluid MSBR were continued. An analog simulation of an expanded lumped -parameter
model was used. Steam temperature control was accomplished by varying the sec-

* ondary=salt flow rate. Improved reactor temperature control was accomplished by
applying the load demand signal directly to the reactor outlet temperature controller
as well as to the steam generators. .

1. INTRODUCTION

By means of an analog computer simulation, preliminary investigation of the
proposed 1000-Mw(e), single-fluid Molten~Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) was con=
tinued.’ For the purposes of this analysis the MSBR plant consisted of a graphite~
moderated, circulating=fuel (primary salt) reactor, a shell-and-tube heat exchanger
for transferring the generated heat to a coolant (secondary salt), a shell-and-tube
supercritical steam generator, and a possible control system. The analog simulation
of the plant consisted of a lumped-parameter heat transfer model for the core, pri-
mary heat exchanger, and steam generator; a two-delayed-neutron-group model of
the circulating-fuel nuclear kinetics with temperature reactivity feedbacks; and
the external control system. This investigation was concerned with the integrated
plant response; it was not concerned with a safety analysis of the system, although
several of the transients introduced would be of an abnormal nature (e.g., loss of
flow). It was an initial probe into the response of the system initiated by such per-
turbations as changes in load demand, loss of primary or secondary flow, and reac-
tivity changes.

The simulation was carried out on the ORNL Reactor Controls Department
analog computer. So that the model would have the maximum dynamic range, the
system differential equations were not linearized, and, as a result, the requisite
quantity of equipment required that the model be severely limited spatially to min-
imize the number of equations. In addition, the pressure in the water side of the
steam generator, as well as in the rest of the plant, and the physical properties of
the salts and water were taken to be time invariant. The temperature of the feed-
water to the steam generators was also held constant.

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PLANT AND MODEL

2.1 Plant Description

The proposed 1000-Mw(e) MSBR steam-eleciric generating plant consisted
of a 2250-Mw(th), graphite=moderated, molten-salt reactor, 4 shell-and-tube
primary heat exchangers, and 16 shell-and-tube supercritical steam generators
(Fig. 1). The reactor core contained two zones: a central zone, a cylinder ~14.4
ft diameter and ~13 ft high with a primary-salt volume fraction of 0.132; and an
outer zone, an annular region ~1.25 ft thick and the same height as the central
zone. The salt volume fraction in this region was 0.37. The primary-salt, bearing

33 and 232, flowed upward through the graphite core in a single pass and then

to the tube side of one of four vertical, single-pass, primary heat exchangers, each
~19 ft long, 5 ft diameter, and constructed of Hastelloy-N. The salt flow rate at
design point was 9.48 x 107 lb/hr. The design-point temperature of the salt enter-
ing the core was 1050°F and that af the core outlet was 1300°F. The liquidus tem-
perature of this salt was approximately 930°F.

The heat generated in the primary salt in the core was transferred from the
tube side of the primary heat exchangers to a countercurrent secondary salt passing
through the shell side. This salt flowed in a closed secondary loop to one of four
horizontal supercritical steam generators. The four secondary loops, one for each
primary heat exchanger, were independent of each other, with each loop supplying
heat to four steam generators. Thus, there was a total of 16 steam generators in the
plant. The design-point flow rate of secondary salt in each loop was 1.78 x 107 lb/hr.
At the design point the secondary-salt, cold-leg temperature was 850°F, and the
hot-leg temperature was 1150°F. The liquidus temperature of this salt was ~725°F.

The shell-and-tube supercritical steam generators were countercurrent,
single-pass, U-tube exchangers ~73 ft long and ~18 in. diameter and constructed
of Hastelloy-N. Feedwater entered the steam generators at the design point at 700°F
and a pressure of about 3750 psi. The outlet steam conditions at the design point
were 1000°F and 3600 psi. Each steam generator produced steam at the design point
at arate of 6.30 x 102 lb/hr. Reference 2 gives a complete description of an earlier,
but quite similar, version of the steam generator and primary heat exchanger.

2.2 Model of the Plant

A spatially lumped parameter model used for the heat transfer system (Fig. 2)
consisted of the reactor core, one primary heat exchanger, one steam generator, the
nuclear kinetics, and a control system as shown in Fig. 5.

In the core, the primary salt in the central zone was divided axially into
four equal lumps, and the graphite was divided into two. The outer zone was divided
equally into two primary-salt lumps and one graphite lump. Since the primary salt
density varied only slightly with temperature, the four cenfral-zone lumps were of
equal mass, as were the two outer-zone lumps. The two central-zone graphite lumps
were of equal mass as well.

The mass flow rate of the primary salt in the two zones of the core was de-
termined by the heat generation rate in each zone so that the temperature rise of

Rate in the Reactor Core and Primary Heat Exchanger.
the primary salt in the two zones was equal. Thus, 81.4% of the flow passed
through the central zone and 18.6% through the outer zone.

A two-de layed-neutron-group approximation of the circulating fuel nuclear
kinetics equations3 was used in the model. This allowed the delayed-neufron pre-
cursor concentration term C;(t = 7) (see Appendix, Sect. 7) to be simulated directly
with two of four available transport lag devices. The delayed-neutron fraction for

33U was 0.00264, and the prompt-neutron generation time was 0.36 msec. The
coefficient of reactivity for the primary salt was =1.33 x 1073 per °F, which was
divided equally among the six primary-salt lumps of the core model. The tem-
perature coefficient for the graphite was +1.06 x 1072 per °F, which was divided
equally among the three graphite lumps.

The mode! was designed to accommodate a variable flow rate of the primary
salt as well as the secondary salt and steam. The required variations of film heat
transfer coefficients with the various salt and steam flow rates were included.

The film coefficient for secondary salt on the shell side of the primary heat ex~
changer and steam generator was proportional to the 0.6 power of the flow rate.
The film coefficient for steam on the tube side of the steam generators was assumed
to be proportional to the 0.8 power of the flow rate. The variation of the film co-
efficient in the reactor core and on the tube (primary salt) side of the primary heat
exchangers decreased with flow, as shown in Fig. 3. The heat conductance across
the tube wall in both exchangers was assumed to be constant.

The primary and secondary salts in the primary heat exchanger were divided
axially into four equal lumps, with the tube wall represented by two lumps. As
did the primary-salt density, the secondary~salt density varied only slightly with
temperature, and, thus, the masses of the salt lumps were assumed to be equal and
constant. A variable transport delay was included in the hot and cold legs of the
secondary-salt loop to simulate the transport of secondary salt between the primary
heat exchanger and the steam generator.

The secondary salt in the steam generator was axially divided into four
lumps of equal mass, as in the primary heat exchanger. The steam on the tube side
was likewise divided into four equal lumps spatially, but of unequal mass. Under
design conditions the supercritical steam density varied from 34 Ib/ft3 at the feed-
water inlet to 5 Ib/ft3 at the steam outlet.5 The density of the steam in the lump
nearest the feedwater entrance was taken as the average density in the quarter of

the steam generator represented by that lump, or 22.7 lb/ft. The densities of the
remaining three steam lumps were determined in a similar manner. The axial tem-
perature distribution in the steam was nonlinear also and was calculated from the
enthalpy by assuming that equal amounts of heat were transferred into each of the
steam lumps from the secondary salt. The specific heat of each lump was then cal-
culated from the enthalpy and temperature distributions. In the model, these re-
sulting design-point values of density and specific heat were assumed to remain
constant during part-load, steady-state conditions and during all transients.

The physical constants used in this simulation are summarized in Table 1.
The various system volumes, masses, flow rates, etc., calculated from the constants
are listed in Table 2. The system equations used are given in the Appendix, Sect. 7.

3. STEADY STATE, PART LOAD OPERATION

The first step in the formulation of a control system to enable the plant to
undergo changes in load was to determine the steady-state, part-load, temperature
and flow profiles for the plant for loads between 20 and 100%. For the series of
transients included in this report, the steady-state values of the following variables
were fixed at part load: (1) the steam temperature was 1000°F, and (2) the reactor
outlet temperature was a function of load (Fig. 4), i.e., the reactor outlet tem-
perature was a linear function of load varying between 1125°F and 1300°F for
loads above 50% and between 1000°F and 1125°F for loads below 50%. The pri-
mary -salt flow rate and feedwater temperature remained constant at their design-
point values of 100% flow and 700°F, respectively. With the values of these
parameters fixed, the remaining temperatures and flows, viz., the secondary-salt
hot- and cold-leg temperatures, the reactor inlet temperature, and the secondary-
salt and steam flow rates,were determined from steady-state, heat balance consid-
erations. Figure 4 shows the resulting variations as a function of load. The reactor
inlet temperature varied linearly between 1000 and 1050°F for loads above 50% and
remained constant at 1000°F for loads below 50%. The secondary-salt, cold-leg
temperature varied approximately linearly between 850°F at design point and about
710°F at 20% load. Arbitrary minimum limits for the steady-state, primary- and
secondary=-salt temperatures were set at 1000 and 800°F, respectively, to ensure a
margin against freezing. Figure 4 shows that while the primary salt does not violate
this minimum, the secondary=salt, cold-leg temperature decreases below its minimum
of 800°F at approximately 75% load. Steady-state calculations for this model in-
dicated that, by decreasing the reactor outlet temperature more rapidly with de=
creasing load in the range near 100% load, the secondary -salt, cold-leg temperature
decreased less rapidly with load and lowered the power level at which it crossed the
800°F minimum. However, since it may be undesirable to decrease the reactor outlet
temperature more rapidly with decreasing load than is shown in Fig. 4, other methods
may be required to maintain the steady-state, cold-leg temperature above its 800°F

minimum at the lower power levels. Such methods are: (1) increasing the steam
temperature above its 1000°F design point as the load decreases, with subsequent
attemperation of the steam with injected feedwater; (2) increasing the feedwater
temperature above its 700°F design point as the load decreases; and (3) reducing
the number of steam generators in use as the load decreases. If valves or bypasses
are considered for use in the salt systems, other methods may prove feasible as well.

Further investigations of steady-state, system temperatures and flows are
being carried out, including studies of off-design conditions in the steam generator.
In the present analog model, insufficient machine time was available to adjust the
model to include a variable steam or feedwater temperature with load, and insuf-
ficient equipment was available to include more than one steam generator.

4, CONTROL SYSTEM

The objective of the load control system used in this study was to maintain
the temperature of the steam delivered to the turbines at a design value of 1000°F
during all steady-state conditions and within a narrow band around this value during
plant transients. The rudimentary control system used in this simulation is shown
in Fig. 5. It consisted of a reactor outlet temperature controller similar to that used
successfully in the MSRE® and a steam temperature controller.

Steam temperature control was accomplished by varying the secondary-salt
flow rate. This method was chosen because of the relatively tight coupling which
existed between steam temperature and secondary-salt flow rate. The measured
steam temperature was compared with its set point of 1000°F, and any error caused
the secondary -salt flow rate to change at a rate proportional to the error if the
error was 2°F or less. If the error was greater than 2°F, the rate of change of the
secondary-salt flow rate was limited to its rate of change for a 2°F error, which was
approximately 11%/min. The reason for imposing this limit is discussed in Sect. 5.1.

To control the reactor outlet temperature, an external, plant-load demand
signal was used to obtain a reactor outlet temperature set point. The outlet temper-
ature set point versus load demand was the same as that for the steady-state, reactor
outlet temperature versus load in Fig. 4. The measured value of the reactor inlet
temperature was subtracted from the outlet temperature set point, and, since the
primary -salt flow rate was constant, a reactor (heat)-power set point was generated
by multiplying this AT by a proportionality constant. The reactor-power set point
was a function of inlet temperature during a transient and, thus, a function of

dynamic load. The measured value of reactor power (from neutron flux) was compared
with the reactor-power set point, and any error was fed to the control rod servo for
appropriate reactivity adjustment. Under normal conditions, the control rod servo
added or removed reactivity at a rate proportional to the reactor-power error if the
error was 1% or less. If the error was greater than 1%, the addition or removal

rate was limited to the rate for a 1% error, which was about 0.01%/sec. This max-
imum rate was encountered only during the studies of reactivity transients. The
maximum magnitude of reactivity that the simulation allowed was £1%.

An example of the action of the control system during a load change is given
in Sect. 5.1. The equations for the simulation are given in the Appendix, Sect. 7.

To obtain more realistic transient results from the simulation, the following
limits were imposed on several of the system variables:

1. The secondary-salt flow rate was limited to a range from 10% to 110% of the
design-point flow rate.

2. The maximum steam flow rate was limited to 110% of the design-point flow rate.

A 5-sec first-order lag was used between the plant-load demand signal and the

steam flow rate in the steam generator.

5. RESULTS

5.1 Load Demand Changes

5.1.1 Load Change of 10%/min

 

Various load change transients were investigated, including a change from
100 to 50% load demand at a rate of 10%/min. After equilibrium had been estab-
lished at 50%, the load demand was increased to 100% at the same rate. The re-
sults are shown in Fig. 6.

The load demand signal reduced the steam flow rate to 50% of full flow at
very nearly the same rate as the load reduction rate.

The reduction of the steam flow rate increased the transit time of the steam
through the steam generator, and the steam temperature rose. This rise was com-
pared with the steam temperature set point of 1000°F, and the resulting error signal
reduced the secondary-salt flow rate. Less heat was thus transferred into the steam
generator, and the rate of the steam temperature rise was reduced. The increased
transit time of the secondary salt in the steam generator tended to cause a reduction
in the secondary-salt, cold-leg temperature. Since the steady-state, secondary-
salt flow rate and temperatures decreased with decreasing load for this control

scheme, the new steady-state, 50% load conditions were assumed quickly for this
transient when the demand reached steady state. The maximum steam temperature
error of ~10°F could be reduced by increasing the rate at which the secondary-salt
flow rate would be allowed to change for a given steam temperature error. This

rate was limited to about 11%/min for a steam temperature of 2°F or more. When
this limit was relaxed or eliminated and faster changes of salt flow rate were allowed
to occur, the flow rate tended to undershoot its new steady-state value, and con-
siderable time was required for the salt flow rate to allow the system to come to
equilibrium.

The load demand signal also reduced the reactor outlet temperature set point
175°F, i.e., from 1300°F at full load to 1125°F at 50% load at a rate of 35°F/min.
As shown in Fig. 6, at the time that the load demand signal reached the 50% level
the reactor inlet temperature had dropped to about 1010°F. Subtraction of this mea-
sured reactor inlet temperature from the outlet temperature set point of 1125°F yields
a AT of 115°F. Since the reactor AT at full load was 250°F, this reduced AT cor-
responded to a reactor power set point of 46%. Therefore, a slight amount of pos-
itive reactivity was added to start the reactor power upward towards 46%. The re-
actor inlet temperature momentarily increased during this transition, but then it
continued to decrease, since the system was being cooled down by the load (the
load was at 50% and the reactor power was at 45.5%). As the reactor inlet tem-
perature approached 1000°F, the AT between the outlet temperature set point (now
constant at 1125°F) and the measured inlet temperature approached 125°F, and
thus the reactor power set point approached 50%. If the reactor inlet temperature
had dropped below 1000°F, the reactor power set point would have been greater
than 50%, and the reactor power would have been raised momentarily to supply
additional heat to the overcooled primary salt. Fig. 6 indicates that for this tran-
sient no undershoot in reactor inlet temperature was experienced, and the system
stabilized quickly at 50% load. A reactor inlet temperature of 1000°F at 50% load
with 100% flow of the primary salt implies a reactor outlet temperature of 1125°F,
which, of course, is the same as its set point. In fact, the measured reactor outlet
temperature in Fig. 6 closely followed the change in its set point.

The transient encountered during the increase in load to 100% at 10%/min
was equally well behaved. The steam temperature was controlled to within 7°F of
its 1000°F design point by the increasing secondary-salt flow rate. Previous
studies! indicate that when increases in load were begun with the secondary -salt
flow rate initially near 100%, the load could be increased only very slowly if the
steam temperature was to be closely controlled. This was due to the small increases
allowed in the secondary=salt flow rate. {The flow rate was limited to 110% of full
flow.) In the present case, however, since the secondary-salt flow rate was re-
duced at reduced loads, larger increases were allowed in this flow rate, which per-
mitted control of the steam temperature during faster load increases. For this rea-
son, when the off-design, steady-state system profiles are investigated further,
reduced secondary-salt flow rate at reduced loads should be considered.
19

5.1.2 Load Change at 5%/min

 

A load change at a rate of 10%/min is considered a relatively severe one
for a large steam plant. Under normal operating conditions, load change rates of
less than 5%/min are more usual. Figure 7 shows the transient results for a load
demand change from 100 to 50% of full load at a rate of 5%/min, with a subsequent
increase in load demand, after equilibrium had been established, to full load at the
same rate. The maximum steam temperature error during the load reduction was de-
creased to 2°F. During the load increase, the error was held to within 2°F until
the increasing secondary-salt flow rate reached its 110% limit. At this point the
steam temperature began to decrease and the error reached a maximum of about 5°F.
After the load demand reached 100% and the secondary=salt temperatures continued
to rise, the steam temperature increased to 1000°F. As the steam temperature tended
to exceed 1000°F, the secondary-salt flow rate decreased from its 110% limit and
maintained the temperature at 1000°F.

For the transients described above, the magnitudes and rates of change of
temperatures and flow rates during the transient were determined essentially by the
rate of change of the load and the steady-state, temperature and flow profiles chosen
for this simulation. This indicates that the final choice of steady-state, temperature
and flow profiles may greatly affect the rate at which the load can be changed on
the salt systems for normal operation. This should be considered in further steady-
state investigations.

The results of these and the following transients are summarized in Table 3.
Listed in the table are the values of the maximum magnitude of the deviation from
the initial steady-state of a system variable and the maximum rate of change of
that variable. The values listed are the maxima encountered at any time during
the transient; they are not necessarily initial rates of change or differences in steady-
state magnitudes. The values in most cases are taken directly from the figures and
are intended only as an aid in interpreting the analog curves and as an order-of-
magnitude estimate of the kinds of variations encountered in the transient cases in-
cluded in this report. Obviously, any change of the conditions under which these
curves were obtained would likely alter these values.

5.2 Primary Flow Transients
5.2.1 Step Loss of One Pump

Three cases were studied involving transient perturbations in the primary -
salt flow rate. The first was an attempt to simulate the sudden (step) loss of one of
the four primary-salt pumps. This case could not be simulated directly because the
mode! of the plant included only one primary heat exchanger. Therefore, the loss
of one of four pumps was approximated in the following way. The primary-salt

flow rate in the reactor core was reduced by 25% as a step while a constant, full
flow rate was maintained in the primary heat exchanger. The transit time of the
primary salt through the core in the neutron kinetics equations was increased as a
step, but the transit time of the salt through the loop external to the core was
maintained constant.

The results of such a transient are shown in Fig. 8. The load demand on
the plant was maintained at 100% and, thus, the reactor outlet temperature set
point at 1300°F. The proportionality constant between the desired reactor AT (i.e.,
the measured reactor inlet temperature subtracted from the reactor outlet tempera-
ture set point) and the reactor power set point was directly proportional to the pri-
mary -salt flow rate and, thus, was also decreased as a step by 25%. Therefore,
for the same reactor inlet temperature and outlet temperature set point, the reactor
power set point decreased 75% upon the step reduction of the primary-salt flow rate.
The measured value of reactor power (100%) was compared with the set point, and
the error of 25% caused the control rod servo to insert negative reactivity at the
maximum rate of 0.01%/sec. The reactor power was reduced to 75% in a few
seconds, incurring only a small transient increase in reactor outlet temperature
(12°F max). The total magnitude of control reactivity needed was 0.025% 8k/k.
A very small, delayed perturbation of less than 2°F in maximum magnitude was
observed in the steam temperature. In the final steady state, the reactor temper-
atures and the steam temperature were restored to their design-point values. The
load demand was 100% and the reactor power was 75%. However, because of the
way in which the loss of one primary pump was approximated for this case, the 100%
in load demand now refers only to the three remaining, fully operating primary
pumps and associated secondary loops and steam generators. Therefore, the power
delivered to the load under these conditions was 75%.

5.2.2 Loss of All Primary Pumps

 

As a second case of interest, the simultaneous coastdown of all four primary
pumps to an aribtrary minimum flow of 10% was investigated. It was assumed that
some device such as a battery powered pony motor on the primary pumps would
maintain some minimum pumping capacity in the primary loop upon loss of power to
the main primary pump motors. The primary-salt flow rate was thus reduced in all
parts of the primary loop to 10% of full flow at a rate of 10%/sec. The results of
this transient are shown in Fig. 9. The proportionality constant between the de-
sired reactor AT and reactor power set point, described in the previous case, was
decreased with the reduced primary-salt flow rate which produced the reactor power
error signal. Negative reactivity was thus introduced at the maximum rate, and
the reactor power decreased in about 25 sec to about 12%. The maximum amount
of control reactivity required was about =0.21% 5k/k. The reactor outlet temper-
ature rose at first to about 1400°F in 15 sec, then decreased to about 1340°F. The
inlet temperature fell below 1000°F in 15 sec. The loss of primary flow while full

heat extraction from the steam generators was maintained caused the secondary -salt,
hot-leg temperature to fall sharply. The cold-leg temperature also decreased. The
decreasing secondary=-salt temperatures caused a severe reduction in steam temper-
ature. The secondary-salt flow rate increased to its limit of 110% in an attempt to
maintain the steam temperature at 1000°F, but with little result.

Due to the assumptions concerning the variations in steam properties made in
formulating the model of the steam generator used in this simulation, the useful
range of the steam generator model was greatly limited (see Appendix, Sect. 7).
The model, therefore, simulated only small variations in steam temperature near
1000°F. Loss of primary or secondary flow to 10%, however, effectively decoupled
the reactor from the steam system, and large magnitude changes in the steam gen-
erator had a greatly reduced effect on the reactor system. Only the direction of
these changes was important. The reactor system transient results are therefore in-
cluded for the flow transient cases.

5.2.3 Loss of All Primary Pymps with Load Reduction

 

The third case involved the same loss of primary flow as described in the
second case (Sect. 5.2.2) but with a reduction in load demand from 100 to 20% at
a rate of 20%/sec. This rate was limited by the assumed maximum rate at which
the turbine steam interceptor valves could close. It was assumed that an auxiliary
heat rejection system would be capable of disposing of 20% of the full plant power.
The reduction of load was initiated 5 sec after the primary pump coastdown was
begun so that some delay time would be simulated for the system to sense and eval-
vate the incident. The results are shown in Fig. 10. The proportionality constant
between the desired reactor AT and reactor power set point was reduced with the
reduction in flow rate. The reactor power reached 12% in about 20 sec. The
reactor outlet temperature rose to about 1400°F, then decreased to about 1200°F at
60 sec, and continued to decrease at a rate of about 0.3°F/sec. The reactor inlet
temperature transient was much like that in the previous case, as were the transients
in the secondary=-salt, hot~ and cold-leg temperatures.

The steam temperature initially rose in this transient, since the fast load
reduction dominated the response in the steam generator when it occurred 5 sec after
the primary flow coastdown. However, this did not prevent large sudden decreases
in the secondary-salt temperatures. Some additional corrective action may be re-
quired to prevent such decreases in temperature, such as a reduction of the secondary -
salt flow rate when primary flow is lost.

The results of these primary flow transients indicate a need for further inves-
tigation of the conditions existing in the secondary-salt loops and steam generators
following a loss of primary flow transient. Attention must be paid to the resulting

magnitude and rates of change of temperature in this part of the system. The model
of the steam generator used in this simulation was not adequate for such studies
because of the approximations made.

5.3 Secondary Flow Transients

The results of the simultaneous reduction of the secondary-salt flow rate in
all four secondary loops to a level of 10% of full flow (the assumed level of auxil-
iary pumping power) at a rate of 10%/sec are shown in Figs. 11 and 12. In Fig.
11, the load demand was maintained constant at 100%, and in Fig. 12 it was de~-
creased to 20% at a rate of 20%/sec beginning 5 sec after the flow reduction. As
in the case of loss of all primary flow to 10%, the loss of secondary flow decoupled
the reactor from the steam system. For the case of constant load demand, the re-
actor inlet temperature initially rose about 200°F in about 60 sec. Since the load
demand remained at 100%, the reactor outlet temperature setpoint remained at
1300°F. The rising inlet temperature thus decreased the reactor power set point,
and negative reactivity was added to reduce the reactor power. The outlet temper-
ature control system maintained the outlet temperature at 1300°F with a maximum
variation of 30°F.

The reduction in the secondary=-salt flow rate with a constant load demand
on the steam generators caused an increase in the difference between the secondary -
salt, hot- and cold-leg temperatures. The hot-leg temperature increased and the
cold-leg temperature decreased. The cold-leg temperature approached the freezing
point. Following the loss of secondary-salt flow, there was no steam temperature
control.

When the load demand was decreased rapidly (20%/sec) to 20% starting 5
sec after the start of the loss of secondary-salt flow (Fig. 12), the initial transients
in system temperatures were, of course, the same as those for constant load demand.
However, when the load demand was decreased, the reactor outlet temperature set
point was decreased to 1050°F for 20% load. Therefore, the reactor outlet temper-
ature controller began to decrease the outlet temperature to 1050°F. The initial
rise in the reactor inlet temperature caused a decrease in the reactor power set point
as before, and negative control reactivity was inserted to decrease power. The
power decreased to about 10% in 30 sec. The secondary-salt, hot-leg temperature
initially tended to rise and the cold-leg temperatures to fall as before, but now the
decreasing reactor outlet temperature decreased the hot-leg temperature after its
initial increase. The cold-leg temperature again approached its freezing point.

A greater amount of negative reactivity was inserted in the reactor during
this transient. The rapidly increasing reactor inlet temperature due to loss of sec
ondary-salt flow and rapidly decreasing reactor outlet temperature set point due to
the large load demand reduction combined to produce a large sustained reactor
28

power error. As aresult, areactor power of only a few per cent was reached and
sustained for many seconds. The positive reactivity inserted between 160 and 250

sec during recovery caused a sudden increase in reactor power when criticality was
again achieved. The system quickly recovered, however, and the appropriate steady-
state conditions were reached.

5.4 Summary of Primary and Secondary Flow Transients

The loss of salt flow in the primary- or secondary=salt loops decoupled the
reactor system from the steam generating system. The reactor outlet temperature
control system conirolled the reactor outlet temperature following the loss of pri-
mary or secondary flow with or without a subsequent reduction in load demand. If
the load demand was not reduced, the conirol system maintained the reactor outlet
temperature to within 100°F of its design point of 1300°F. When a reduction in
load demand followed the loss of flow, the controller decreased the reactor outlet
temperature in accordance with the accompanying reduction in its set point (1050°F
at 20% load). The reactor inlet temperature, however, decreased well below the
freezing point of the primary salt upon loss of the primary flow because of the in-
creased transit time of the salt in the primary heat exchanger whether or not the
load demand was reduced 5 sec after loss of flow. Therefore, upon the loss of pri-
mary flow, steps must be taken to prevent a reduction in the reactor inlet temper-
ature. Decreasing the secondary-salt flow through the primary heat exchangers to
transfer out less heat would probably be the most effective way to accomplish this.

The secondary-salt temperatures also decreased upon loss of primary flow.
To prevent an undesirably low temperature of the cold-leg, the load must be re-
duced sufficiently fast. Decreasing the secondary=-salt flow rate to control reactor
inlet temperature as discussed above aggravates this situation, because the transit
time of the secondary salt through the steam generator is increased, which further
lowers the secondary=salt temperatures. Upon loss of primary flow, then, the sec-
ondary-salt flow rate must be decreased to prevent a low reactor inlet temperature,
and the load must be reduced sufficiently fast to prevent low secondary-salt cold-
leg temperatures.

Upon loss of secondary=salt flow to 10% the reactor inlet temperature tended
to increase and remain above 1050°F when the load demand was not reduced (i.e.,
a constant outlet temperature set point). When the load was reduced, the inlet
temperature remained above 960°F.

Loss of secondary=salt flow rate produced undesirable decreases in the sec-
ondary-salt cold-leg temperatures. Therefore, as in the case of loss of primary flow,
the load must be reduced at a rate sufficiently fast to prevent freezing of the sec-
ondary salt when loss of secondary salt flow rafe occurs. Some additional control
action may also be required to maintain the reactor inlet temperature above 1000°F.

5.5 Reactivity Transients

Transients initiated by both positive and negative reactivity excursions were
investigated. The excursions included a negative step in reactivity of -0.2% sk/k
and positive steps of 0.15% with and without the control rod servo operative. The
positive reactivity steps were investigated from an initial steady-state power level
of 25% to obtain the maximum positive power-excursion range for this simulation.
The maximum reactor power allowable was about 160% due to the scaling chosen
for the simulation. Therefore, the maximum positive power-excursion range for the
simulation was from about 25 to 160%, or a factor of 6.4 in power. Under normal
conditions, the control rod servo added or removed reactivity at a rate proportional
to the reactor power error for errors of 1% or less. Above this value, the addition
or removal rate was limited to its rate at 1% power error, which was about 0.01%/sec.
The maximum magnitude of reactivity which simulation allowed was £1%.

5.5.1 Negative Step of 0.2% sk/k

Figure 13 shows the results of a negative step in reactivity of 0.2% sk/k.
First, the reactor power decreased rapidly to about 38%. Since the load demand
signal remained at 100%, the reactor outlet temperature set point remained at
1300°F. The reactor inlet temperature did not immediately change upon insertion
of the negative reactivity, and thus the reactor power set point remained momen-
tarily at 100%. The resulting initial power error signal of 62% caused the control
rod to add reactivity to the system at its maximum rate of about 0.01%/sec.

The sudden reduction in reactor power also caused a rapid decrease in the
reactor outlet temperature from 1300 to about 1200°F. After a few seconds delay,
this reduction in the primary-salt temperature appeared as a decrease in the reactor
inlet temperature. When the inlet temperature returned to about 1015°F, the pos-
itive reactivity added by the control rods and the negative primary-salt temperature
coefficient had returned the reactor power to about 115%. The reactor power set
point for this inlet temperature was 114%, since the outlet temperature set point
remained 1300°F during the entire transient. Therefore, the reactor power error
had changed sign, and the control rod now began to add negative reactivity to the
system. As the reactor inlet temperature approached 1050°F, the reactor power
set point approached 100%, and the system slowly returned to design-point conditions
with a control rod reactivity of +0.2% to cancel the -0.2% inserted.

The effect of the reduction in the primary -salt temperatures appeared as a
reduction in the steam temperature of about 32°F, which was delayed about 15 sec
owing to the transit time of the secondary salt between the primary heat exchanger
and the steam generator. The steam temperature controller increased the secondary-
salt flow rate at its maximum rate of about 11%/min in an attempt to return the steam
temperature to 1000°F. This flow rate, however, had an upper limit of 110% of
32

full flow. When this limit was reached, further increases in steam temperature were
accomplished only by increases in the secondary -salt temperatures. When the steam
temperature reached 1000°F and tended to exceed this level, the secondary -salt
flow rate began to decrease from its 110% limit, maintaining the steam temperature
at 1000°F. The maximum system temperature deviations and maximum rafes of
change of temperatures encountered during this transient are summarized in Table 3.

5.5.2 Positive Step of 0.15% sk/k

 

Figure 14 shows the results of a positive step in reactivity of 0.15% from an
initial power of 25%. The reactor power increased rapidly to about 144% while the
control rod added negative reactivity at its maximum rate. The sudden increase in
the reactor power caused a rapid increase in the reactor outlet temperature of 100°F
from its initial value of 1063°F. An increase in the reactor inlet temperature of
56°F from its initial value of 1000°F followed. When the inlet temperature returned
to 1040°F, the reactor power had decreased to 8.5%. Since the reactor outlet tem-
perature set point was constant during this transient at 1063°F, the reactor power
set point at this time was 9%, and, thus, the control system began to add positive
reactivity to the system to increase the reactor power. As the inlet temperature
approached 1000°F, the power set point approached the initial level of 25%. The
temporary increase in the reactor inlet temperature beginning at approximately 70
sec was due to the decrease in the secondary -salt flow rate which was attempting
to control the delayed response in the steam temperafure. The increasing reactor
temperatures produced an increase in the steam temperature, which was delayed by
about 65 sec because of the transit time of the secondary salt between the heat ex-
changers at the initial 22% flow rate. The steam temperature rose to about 1028°F
before the decreasing secondary-salt flow rate returned it to 1000°F. The relatively
long, secondary-salt loop transit time reduced the capability of the secondary=-salt
flow rate to control the steam temperature, and several oscillations were allowed to
occur before the system returned to normal steady-state conditions at 25% power
level. The total excess energy added to the system by the reactor power "pulse"
from the initial power rise to the point at which the power first returned to the 25%
level was approximately 13,000 Mw-sec. The maximum system temperature devia-
tions and maximum rates of change of temperatures encountered during this transient
are summarized in Table 3.

5.5.3 Positive Step of 0.15% 5k/k with Conirol Rod Servo Inactive

 

A positive step in reactivity of 0.15% was also inserted with the power level
at 25% and with the control rod servo inactive; that is, no conirol reactivity was
added or subtracted from the system at any time. Only the temperature coefficients
of reactivity were allowed to control the transient. The coefficients used in the
simulation were =2.4 x 1072 per °C for the primary salt and +1.9 x 1072 per °C for
the graphite. The results of this fransient are shown in Fig. 15. The reactor power

reached a peak of about 169% before the negative reactivity added by the increase
in the primary=-salt temperatures was sufficient to terminate the excursion. The re-
actor outlet and inlet temperatures increased to a maximum of about 1655 and 1580°F,
respectively, at about 200 sec, which represented increases of 592 and 580°F from
their initial steady-state values. The steam temperature increased to about 1150°F
at about 115 sec in its delayed response because of the secondary-salt transit time.
When the steam temperature error occurred at about 65 sec, the secondary-salt flow
rate decreased in an attempt to reduce the steam temperature, since this part of the
control system was still operative. However, a lower limit was placed on the sec~
ondary-salt flow rate at 10% of full flow. The steam temperature was decreased by
the decreasing flow rate until this limit was reached, after which the steam temper~
ature began to rise again to a maximum of 1195°F at 340 sec.

6. TRANSFER FUNCTION

The full-power transfer function relating small input reactivity perturbations
to reactor power with constant power removal from the system was measured on the
plant simulation and calculated by the use of a digital computer code. A sine wave
oscillator was used to introduce small reactivity perturbations in the analog com-
puter simulation, and the resulting reactor power perturbations were recorded. The
magnitude of the input reactivity was about 2 x 10” 5 sk/k peak-to-peak. The
magnitude of the power oscillations varied between 0.4 to 1.5% peak-to-peak in
the frequency range of 0.01 to 2.0 Hz. The measured values of fransfer function
are plotted in Fig. 16.

The digital code used to calculate the transfer function from the same set of
simulation equations was SFR-3. 7 The calculated results are also plotted in Fig. 16
for frequencies in the range of 0.0016 to 2.0 Hz. The phase shift versus frequency
is also plotted.

SFR-3 was also used to calculate the same transfer function but with later
"values for the temperature coefficients of reactivity. The values used in the simu-
lation and in the caleulations described above were -2.4 x 107 sk/k/°C for the
primary salt gnd +1.9 x 107° sk/k/°C for the graphite. Thy later values were
-3.52x 107° sk/k/°C for the primary salt and +2, 7 x 107 sk/k/°C for the graph-
ite, or a net isothermal coefficient of -1.05 x 10-2 sk/k/°C which is somewhat
greater in magnitude than before. The resulting transfer function for this case is also
shown in Fig. 16. Due to the considerably larger isothermal coefficient, the low-
frequency portion of the gain is somewhat lower. This effect tends to increase the
linear stability of the system.

Transport delays were used in the secondary =salt hot- and cold-legs to account
for the transit time of the secondary salt between the primary heat exchanger and the
steam generator. Thus, from Fig. 2, .

T, = Tt +m), (10)
Tg = T(t +1). (1m

The values used for 11 and m were 14.5 and 11.9 sec, respectively, at design-
point flow rate of the secondary salt and were inversely proportional to that flow
rate at off-design conditions. No transport delay was included for the flow of pri-
mary salt between the reactor core and the primary heat exchanger.

Heat transfer coefficients in the above equations were calculated as follows.
In the primary heat exchanger, the term hg in Eqs. (4) and (5) included the film
coefficient inside the tube and one-half of the tube~wall conductance. The other
half of the tube-wall conductance and the cutside-film coefficient were included in
the term hg in Eqs. (5) and (6). When the flow rate of the primary salt was changed,
the film coefficient varied with flow, as shown in Fig. 3, while the tube-wall con-
ductance was maintained constant. Similarly, the film-coefficient part of the term
hy, varied as the 0.6 power of the secondary-salt flow rate, and the tube-wall-
conductance part was constant. The heat transfer coefficients h. ; and h in the
steam generator were similarly calculated. w

The heat transfer driving force AT used in the above equations is indicated
by the dashed lines in Fig. 2. In each case, the AT for a salt (or steam) lump with-
out a dashed line was that indicated by the dashed line on the immediately preceding
(upstream) lump.
41

In the Egs. (1)=(9) the masses associated with each graphite, salt, and steam
lump were constant during all steady-state and transient conditions. So also were
the values of the specific heats of each lump. The temperatures, flow rates, and
heat transfer coefficients were allowed to vary.

The masses of the graphite and salts were equally divided among the appro-
priate lumps. For example, the total mass of the primary salt in zone I was equally
divided among lumps pl, p2, p3, and p4 (Fig. 2). In the case of the steam, the
mass of each lump was calculated from the design-point conditions under the assump-
tion that equal amounts of heat were transferred into each of the four lumps. The
specific heat of each lump was similarly calculated. The values of mass and specific
heat were then assumed to be constant under all steady-state and transient conditions.
This assumption greatly limited the range of the steam generator model, and any
transients involving large steam-temperature variations are subject to error.

7.2 Nuclear Kinetics Model

A two-delayed neutron group approximation of the circulating-fuel, point-
kinetics equations was used for the nuclear behavior of the core. The equations were:

T. = transit time of primary salt through core,

0, = steady-state design point reactivity (associated with flowing fuel),
a; = temperature coefficient of reactivity of core lump pi,
ATy; = variation from design-point temperature of lump pi,

oc = control rod (or other externally introduced) reactivity.

Variation of the primary-salt flow rate through the core varies the value of
the transit times 7. and 7| inversely proportional to flow rate. Provision was made
in the simulation for these variations to enable study of transients in the primary -salt
flow rate. The lag term C(t = 7) was also included in the simulation.

The negative temperature coefficient of reactivity for the primary salt was
divided equally among the six primary=-salt lumps in the core model. Similarly, the
positive coefficient of the graphite was divided equally among the three graphite
lumps.

Due to the low value of the delayed~neutron fraction for 233, the gains
associated with the nuclear kinetics equations were among the highest in the simu-
lation. However, a small net temperature coefficient of reactivity required only
modest amounts of reactivity for normal control.

7.3 Control System

7.3.1 Steam Temperature Controller

 

The steam temperature was controlled by varying the secondary-salt flow
rate and, thus, the heat input to the steam generator. An error in steam tempera-
ture caused the flow rate to change at a rate proportional to the error, i.e.,

dF,

ral ~a(T - 1000°F) , (16)
where F, is the secondary salt flow rate, Tg is the outlet steam temperature, and
a is the controller gain.

The controller gain a used in the simulation was approximately 5.5%/min
change in flow rate for each 1°F error in steam temperature for errors of 2°F or
less. For errors greater than 2°F, the rate of change of flow rate was limited to
11%/min. No optimization was carried out to obtain these values, but they
produced reasonably good system response.
43

7.3.2 Reactor Outlet Temperature Controller

 

The reactor outlet temperature set point was determined by the plant load
demand (Fig. 5). The set point as a function of load demand is given in Fig. 4.
The equations are

= <
T 350 P, ng T 990  (0.5<P= 1.0), (17)
set
and
= + <
T 250 Pp, +1000 (0<PZ0.5, (18)
set
where Troget is the reactor outlet temperature set point, and P jemand is the fractional

plant load demand.

The reactor power~-level set point was proportional to the difference between
the outlet temperature set point and the measured reactor inlet temperature, i.e.,

Pe - AT, - Ty ! (19)
set set

where Pr. is the reactor power level set point, T.; is the measured reactor inlet

et
temperature, and A is the proportionality constant.

The proportionality constant A was itself proportional to the primary-salt
flow rate, which was maintained constant for all cases except for the studies of loss
of primary flow. In these studies the proportionality constant varied directly with
flow rate in the simulation. The assumption of constant specific heat of the primary
salt is also implied here. If is not necessary to assume constant flow and constant
specific heat in an actual operating conirol system of this type. Additional circuitry
may be provided to compensate for these effects, as was demonstrated in the MSRE
control system (Ref. 6).

A reactor-power-level error was obtained by subtracting the set point value
from the measured value (from neutron flux), i.e.,

e =P -P . (20)
r
set

This power error ¢ was the input signal to a conirol rod servo described by
the second-order transfer function:

6) = pt, 1)
44

where G is the controller gain, w is the bandwidth, and is the damping factor.

In this simulation the bandwidth was 5 Hz and the damping factor was 0.5.
These values are typical of the kind and size of servo which may be used in this
control-rod-drive service. The gain of the controller G was such that, for
le} £ 1% of full power, the control reactivity addition or withdrawal rate was about
0.01%/sec, i.e.,

do

- = 0.01%/sec , (22)

where p_ is the control reactivity (see Sect. 7.2).
For power level errors greater than 1% of full power, the reactivity addition

or withdrawal rate was limited to 0.01%/sec. Integration of Eq. (22) yields the
value for the control reactivity in the kinetics equations of Sect. 7.2.
