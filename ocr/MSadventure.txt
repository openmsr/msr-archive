Abstract - A personal history of the development of molten-salt reactors in the United States is
presented. The initial goal was an aircraft propulsion reactor, and a molten fluoride-fueled
Aircraft Reactor Experiment was operated at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1954. In 1956,
the objective shifted to civilian nuclear power, and reactor concepts were developed using a
circulating UF -ThF, fuel, graphite moderator, and Hastelloy-N pressure boundary. The program
culminated in the successful operation of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment in 1965 to 1969. By
then the Atomic Energy Commission's goals had shifted to breeder development; the molten-salt
program supported on-site reprocessing development and study of various reactor arrangements
that had potential to breed. Some commercial and foreign interest contributed to the program
which, however, was terminated by the government in 1976. The current status of the technology

and prospects for revived interest are summarized.

This story of the development of the molten salt
reactor (MSR) is told the way I remember it. For me, it
started in 1956 after I had decided that I would like to
become more directly involved in the development of
nuclear power. To do this I needed a new job, and to
get such a job I needed a few references. Thus I wrote
to Alvin Weinberg to see whether he would put in a
good word for me.

My acquaintance with Alvin started in 1946-1947
when [ was a student at Oak Ridge's “Clinch College of
Nuclear Knowledge,” as the training school under
Eugene Wigner and Fred Seitz came to be called.
Alvin, who was then assistant director of the Physics
Division, was one of my teachers and 1 was
tremendously impressed with him. I went back to a
Union Carbide research laboratory in Cleveland, Ohio,
at the end of my year at Oak Ridge, and in late 1947,
when it was decided that Union Carbide was to take
over the operation of Oak Ridge National Laboratory
(ORNL), I was called to New York to brief a few vice-
presidents as to who the good guys and the bad guys
were. All I could think to tell them was to get on the
good side of Alvin Weinberg. I told them that he was
the natural leader of the place and that their success
would depend on him. I have never told Alvin of this
incident, and I am sure my advice was not necessary
for the Union Carbide officials to recognize Alvin's
worth.

When I wrote Alvin for a reference, he responded
by asking me to come to Oak Ridge to head up a
program to investigate power reactors fueled with

molten salts. Although I did not know much about
molten salts at the time, the job sounded exciting and I
gladly accepted.

Molten-salt reactors were first proposed by Ed
Bettis and Ray Briant of ORNL during the post-World
War II attempt to design a nuclear-powered aircraft.
The attraction of molten fluoride salts for that program
was the great stability of the salts, both to high
temperatures and to radiation. An active development
program aimed at such an aircraft reactor was carried
out from about 1950 to 1956. The Aircraft Reactor
Experiment, a small reactor using a circulating molten
fuel salt, operated for several days in 1954 and reached
a peak temperature of 1620° F. In 1956 interest in the
airplane began to fall off, and Alvin Weinberg wished
to see whether the molten fluoride fuel technology that
had been developed for the aircraft could be adapted to
civilian power reactors. Part of his interest stemmed
from the fact that all of the other materials and coolants
being suggested for reactors had been anticipated by
the reactor design group at the Metallurgical Lab
oratory in Chicago during World War II. This was new.

In starting the new civilian program, we had a
tremendous head start from the capable staff and the
research under way for the aircraft program. Our
civilian program was in reality a continuation of the old
military program with a few changes in emphasis.

It 1s my impression that the Division of Reactor
Development (DRD) of the U.S. Atomic Energy Com
mission (AEC) never showed much enthusiasm for the
Molten Salt Reactor Program. At the start, in 1956,
Alvin had to use all his powers of persuasion with
Kenneth Davis, who was then director of the DRD, to
provide us with an initial $2 million per year to start
the program. A couple of years later the DRD realized
that they were supporting too many fledgling reactor
concepts. While each concept could be researched at
the exploratory level with only modest funding, to
carry the development of any concept to fruition would
require tremendously larger expenditures. With funds
limited, only a few reactor concepts could survive.

One of the methods employed by the AEC to
eliminate reactor concepts was to establish task forces
of outside experts to evaluate the reactor concepts and,
especially, to point out their weaknesses. After a
couple of other reactor concepts had been eliminated
by this process, the AEC formed the Fluid Fuels
Reactor Task Force to evaluate and compare three
different fluid fuel reactors: the aqueous homogeneous,
the liquid bismuth, and the MSRs. The task force met
In Washington for about two months early in 1959. I
was there to represent the molten salt system, Beecher
Briggs of ORNL represented the aqueous homo-
geneous, and Frank Miles from Brookhaven National
Laboratory represented the bismuth-graphite reactor.
Task force members came from other AEC
laboratories, from electric utilities, from architect
engineering firms, and from the AEC itself. The first
sentence of the Summary of the Task Force Report
(TID-8505) was, “The Molten Salt Reactor has the
highest probability of achieving technical feasibility.”

This conclusion arose from the fact that the molten
fluoride salts (a) have a wide range of solubility of
uranium and thorium, (b) are stable thermodynamically
and do not undergo radiolytic decomposition, (c) have
a very low vapor pressure at operating temperatures,
and (d) do not attack the nickel-based alloy used in the
circulating salt system.

As a result of the task force deliberations, the other
two concepts were abandoned and the molten salt
system continued its precarious existence. The reactor
considered by the Task Force was a converter reactor,
not a breeder, and was described as follows:

The reference design molten salt reactor is an
INOR-8 (now called Hastelloy-N) vessel containing
a graphite assembly 12.25 feet in diameter by 12.25
feet high, through which molten salt flows in
vertical channels. The fuel salt is a solution
composed of 0.3 mole percent UF,, 13 mole percent
ThF,, 16 mole percent BeF,, and 70.7 mole percent
LiF. The fuel salt is heated from 1075° F to 1225°
F in the core and is circulated from the reactor
vessel to four primary heat exchangers by four fuel
pumps. A barren coolant salt is used as the
intermediate heat exchange fluid."

It 1s interesting to me that this reactor description
prepared hurriedly in early 1959 differs only in minor
detail from the MSR designs of the 1970s.

Until late 1959 our exploration of MSRs was not
focused sharply on the breeding possibilities of the
system, although we always preferred high conversion
ratio designs in our studies. Starting in 1960, however,
the financial support of the Molten Salt Reactor
Program was dependent on its breeding possibilities,
and thereafter the program was focused on the molten
salt breeder reactor (MSBR). Thermal breeders have
only a small breeding margin, and, to breed com-
fortably, fission products must be kept at low
concentrations. This means that the fuel must be
purified frequently. The fact that the molten salt fuel is
a liquid helps in this respect, since the gaseous fission
products come off continuously and the fuel can be
purified from other fission products by suitable liquid
extraction methods. In principle, this purification is
much easier for MSRs than it 1s for solid fuel reactors,
since the steps of dissolution and refabrication of the
fuel are avoided.

Over the course of years, suitable processing
methods were found so that the single-fluid reactor
described above could become a breeder. In 1960,
however, our limited knowledge of processing
chemistry forced us to consider breeder reactors in
which the fuel (fissile uranium) was kept in one fluid
and the fertile material (thorium) was in a separate
fluid. Both fluids circulated through the reactor, but
were kept separate by walls of graphite.

By the end of 1959, our engineering development
program had proceeded far enough that we felt justified
in proposing an MSR experiment (MSRE), but getting
money and permission appeared difficult. Then one
day I heard a rumor that Frank Pittman, who had
succeeded Ken Davis as director of the DRD, had
expressed interest in funding as many as four “quick
and dirty” reactor experiments provided that each one
should cost less than a million dollars. As I remember
it, I wrote a proposal that night and submitted it
through channels the next day. I outlined the general
features of the reactor, and by analogy with another
reactor system for which a cost estimate had been
made. I came up with a cost estimate of $4.18 million.
The proposal was accepted, although by the time the
design had been detailed the cost estimate had doubled.

The conceptual design of the MSRE was arrived at
as follows. To keep the reactor simple we intended to
simulate only the fuel stream of a two-fluid breeder
reactor, so that no thorium fluoride was included. We
wanted the neutron spectrum to be near thermal, as it
would be in a commercial reactor, and since graphite
was the moderator, this dictated the minimum physical
size. The moderator was in the form of a 1.37-m-diam
x 1.62-m-high right circular cylinder. Had it been
smaller, the neutron leakage would have caused the
neutron spectrum to be more energetic than we wished.
We would have liked to have a higher power density,
but cost considerations limited us to ~10 MW of heat.
There was also another reason for limiting the power of
the reactor. The AEC accounting rules at the time
allowed us to build a 10-MW reactor as an experiment,
using operating funds. A higher power reactor would
have required us to obtain a capital appropriation and
would have limited our freedom to make changes.
Actually we miscalculated the heat transfer char-
acteristics and the reactor operated at only 8 MW.

I ceased being director of the MSR program in
1960, at which time capable engineers took over for the
construction of the MSRE and the later development
work. However, | maintained my strong interest in the
program during my tenure as deputy director of ORNL
and even after leaving in 1970.

Design of the MSRE started in the summer of 1960
and construction started 18 months later, at the
beginning of 1962. The reactor went critical in June
1965, and was briefly at full power a year later. After a
shakedown period, reliable operation was achieved in
December 1966, when a 30-day continuous run was
made at full power. While carrying out numerous
experiments, the reactor was operated at full power
most of the time during the next 15 months, after which
the °U was removed from the fuel salt and later
replaced with *°U. The reactor was operated with **U
as the fuel from January through May 1969. This was
the first time >°U had been used as a reactor fuel, and
AEC Chairman Glen Seaborg and Ray Stoughton, co-
discoverers of 2°U, were present when the reactor first
went critical with **U fuel.

During the remainder of 1969, the reactor was
devoted to a number of experiments, including xenon
stripping, fission-product deposition, tritium behavior,
and plutonium additions. Operation was finally
terminated in December 1969 so that the available
funds could be applied to other development areas.

In 1962 the AEC first took a position strongly
favoring the development of breeder reactors. This
position was spelled out in its 1962 “Report to the
President.” In that report two breeder reactors were
described and discussed. One was the familiar liquid-
metal-cooled fast breeder reactor (LMFBR) using the
#8U-Pu breeding cycle, and the other was the molten-
salt-fueled thermal breeder using the *U-Th cycle.
Somewhat surprisingly, the report devoted about 60%
as much favorable space to the molten salt thermal
breeder as to the fast breeder, despite the much broader
countrywide participation in the fast breeder program.

The AEC's 1962 “Report to the President” was
written while the MSRE was under construction, but
apparently we had proceeded far enough with our
development program to impress the Subcommittee on

Reactors of the General Advisory Committee with the
value of the molten salt system. As soon as the “Report
to the President” presented its justification for the
development of breeder reactors, however, the existent
Liquid Metal Cooled Reactors Department of the DRD
proposed an elaborate and wide-ranging program for
the development of the LMFBR concept, and that
program began to gain momentum. On the other hand,
those of us involved in the MSR program chose to wait
until the MSRE had operated success fully before
trying to expand our program. This, we thought, was
the prudent thing to do, but by the time we were
prepared to go for a larger reactor, the momentum and
money needs of the LMFBR program were massive
and there was no interest in funding a competitor.

The MSRE was a very successful experiment, in
that it answered many questions and posed but a few
new ones. Perhaps the most important result was the
conclusion that it was quite a practical reactor. It ran
for long periods of time, and when maintenance was
required, it was accomplished safely and without
excessive delay. Also, it demonstrated the expected
flexibility and ease of handling the fuel. As mentioned
above, it was the first reactor in the world to operate
with #°U as the sole fuel, and the highly radioactive
*3U used would have been extremely difficult to
handle if it had had to be incorporated into solid fuel
elements. In preparation for the run with *°U, the *°U
was removed from the carrier salt in 4 days by the
fluoride volatility process. This process decontam-
mated the 218 kg of uranium of gamma radiation by a
factor of 4 x 10” so that it could be handled without
shielding. As an aside, this equipment used for the
MSRE was sufficiently large so that it could
satisfactorily handle all of the fuel processing needs for
a 1000-MWe molten salt converter reactor (MSCR),
about which I will say more later.

Three problems requiring further development
turned up during the construction and operation of the
MSRE. The first was that the Hastelloy-N used for the
MSRE was subject to a kind of “radiation hardening,”
due to accumulation of helium at grain boundaries.
Later, it was found that modified alloys that had fine
carbide precipitates within the grains would hold the
helium and restrain this migration to the grain
boundaries. Nevertheless, it is still desirable to design
well-blanketed reactors in which the exposure of the
reactor vessel wall to fast neutron radiation is limited.

The second problem concerned the tritium
produced by neutron reactions with lithium. At high
temperatures the radioactive tritium, which is, of
course, chemically like hydrogen, penetrates metals
quite readily, and unless captured in some way, would
appear in the steam generators and reach the
atmosphere. After considerable development work, it
was found that the intermediate salt coolant, a mixture
of sodium fluoride and sodium fluoroborate, would
capture the tritium and that it could be removed and
isolated in the gas purge system.

The third problem came from the discovery of tiny
cracks on the inside surface of the Hastelloy-N piping
for the MSRE. It was found that these cracks were
caused by the fission product tellurtum. Later work
showed that this tellurium attack could be controlled by
keeping the fuel on the reducing side. This is done by
adjustment of the chemistry so that about 2% of the
uranium is in the form of UF, as opposed to UF,. This
can be controlled rather easily now that good analytical
methods have been developed. If the UF; to UF, ratio
drops too low, it can be raised by the addition of some
beryllium metal, which, as it dissolves, will rob some
of the fluoride ions from the uranium.

As solutions to these new problems became
available, those of us familiar with the technology
believed that we were ready for the next step, the
construction of a reactor producing modest amounts of
electrical power, or at least the development of the
equipment needed for such a reactor. In any case,
productive continuation of the MSR program in the
United States would soon require funds an order of
magnitude greater than previous expenditures.

In 1972 ORNL proposed a major development
program that would culminate in the construction and
operation of a demonstration reactor called the Molten
Salt Breeder Experiment. The program was estimated
to cost a total of $350 million over a period of 11 yr.
However, those who would have had to approve such a
program were already heavily committed to the
LMFBR and guiding a very expensive development
program that would be spending about $400 million
each year by 1975. It was asking too much of human
nature to expect them to believe that a much less
expensive program could be effective in developing a
competing system, and the ORNL proposal was
rejected. In January 1973, ORNL was directed to
terminate MSR development work. For reasons I do
not understand, the program was reinstated a year later,
and in 1974 ORNL submitted a more elaborate
proposal with suitably inflated costs calling for about
$720 million to be spent over an 11-yr period. This last
proposal was also rejected, and in 1976 ORNL was
again ordered to shut down the MSR program “for
budgetary reasons.”

The decision to cut off the funding for the MSR
program was supported by an “evaluation” of the
MSBR (1972) prepared internally by the Division of
Reactor Development and Technology in response to a
request from the Office of Science and Technology.

Although this report contained no overt
recommendations, the Conclusions section, after
granting some attractive features of the MSR,

emphasized the difficulty of solving a number of

problems, including those described above. It was
stated that after realistic solutions for these problems
had been demonstrated, proceeding toward engineering
development would require “reasonable assurances that
large-scale government and industrial resources can be
made available on a continuing basis in light of other
commitments to the commercial nuclear power
program and higher priority energy developments.”
This was, of course, true.

This evaluation was prepared before the solutions
to the tritium evolution and tellurtum-cracking
problems were known. On a recent trip to Japan, I was
asked the following question by a group of engineers
who were thoroughly familiar with MSR technology:
“Concerning the MSBR development program, the US
AEC pointed out the following major technological
problems in 1972, namely the problem on the
materials, the tritium and fuel salt chemical processing.
And we think that most of the above problems have
been settled by the splendid effort of R&D; performed
by ORNL thereafter, but how was it evaluated in the
US?” I do not believe that such an evaluation was
made or that the Department of Energy is prepared to
make one.

For the several groups of enthusiasts for molten salt
technology in other countries, the reasons for the
demise of the U.S. program are important. It 1s difficult
for them to overcome the stigma of abandonment of the
MSR by the country of its origin. In my opinion, these
are the major factors contributing to the cessation of
the program.

I. The political and technical support for the
program in the United States was too thin
geographically. Within the United States, only in Oak
Ridge, Tennessee, was the technology really
understood and appreciated.

2. The MSR program was in competition with the
fast breeder program, which got an early start and had
copious government development funds being spent in
many parts of the United States. When the MSR
development program had progressed far enough to
justify a greatly expanded program leading to
commercial development, the AEC could not justify
the diversion of substantial funds from the LMFBR to a
competing program.

It was often suggested by the DRD that evidence of
industrial support for the MSR was needed to gain
AEC enthusiasm. However, the evidence available for
this support was ignored.

At least two privately funded technology evaluation
and design studies of the MSR were made. One was
carried out in 1970 by a group called the Molten-Salt
Breeder Reactor Associates, headed by Black and
Veach and including five Midwest utilities. The other
study was done by The Molten Salt Group, which was
headed by Ebasco Services, Inc., and included 5 large
industrial firms and 15 utilities. Both of these studies
reported favorably on the promise of the system. The
Molten Salt Group concluded in 1971 that the existing
technology was sufficient to justify construction of a
molten salt demonstration plant.

About 10 yr have elapsed since the demise of the
active MSR development program at ORNL. In that
interval several changes have occurred that might have
some influence on how the MSR is perceived.

Foremost has been the decreased rate of expansion
of electricity use in developed countries. This has
sharply reduced the expected rate of building new
nuclear power plants by as much as an order of
magnitude. As a result, we no longer expect a crisis in
the availability of uranium for at least 50 yr. Even with
some renewed growth, it is unlikely that breeders will
be needed before 2035 to 2050. With this delay in the
need for breeders, the primary current interest should
be for reactors that are economical and that have other
features of merit that might encourage a revival of new
reactor construction. Thus, there 1s no need for the
MSR to emerge as a full-blown breeder, and it should
now be considered on its merits as a relatively simple,
low cost, converter reactor, the MSCR. The fact that
the MSCR can be developed into a breeder at the
suitable time by the addition of chemical processing
equipment should be regarded as a positive feature.
Full engineering development of the known methods
for accomplishing this, however, can be deferred for
decades.

Another major change is the very high capital costs
that are reported in building fast breeder reactors. The
result is that the LMFBR will not be competitive with
light-water reactors (LWRs) until natural uranium
reaches astronomically high costs; in fact, until it
attains levels it may never reach in the next century.
Thus, fast reactors as currently designed will not be
economically competitive for perhaps two generations
(of people). By the time they are competitive, a whole
new crop of nuclear engineers will have to learn the
technology.

Off hand one might think that the high cost of
LMFBRs would open the door to other advanced
reactor systems, such as the MSCR. The practical
effect is negative, however, since the new information
casts doubt on the projected costs of all advanced
reactor systems, and this presumption is difficult to
overcome without actual experience with hardware. In
1970 a careful detailed estimate was made of the
capital cost of an MSR and it turned out to be within
1% of the cost of an LWR. Construction experience is
needed, however, to verify such a cost estimate.

Like the LMFBR, the MSR has an intermediate
heat transfer loop to isolate the steam generators from
radioactive fluids. However, there are basic reasons for
expecting MSCR capital costs to be lower than those
for the LMFBR:

1. The fuel handling system will be much simpler.

2. The molten salts have a much higher heat
capacity per unit volume than sodium, so that the
physical size of pumps and piping will be smaller.

3. There is no threat of a “core disruptive accident”
with the MSCR, so that safety-related equipment can
be simpler.

4. The molten salts have a much lower thermal
conductivity than sodium, so that sudden coolant
temperature changes will provide less thermal shock to
system components.

5. The coolant is more compatible with water than
1s sodium, so that there should be fewer problems in
the design and maintenance of steam generators.

On the other hand, it should be remembered that the
development of large engineering components for the
MSCR is in a primitive state and that any future
development program would surely reveal new
difficulties of uncertain magnitude. Furthermore, the
high degree of radioactivity of the MSCR's primary
system will present problems of design for remote
maintenance. The continuing development of robots
ought to be of some help here.

Another change is the effective moratorium on fuel
processing for LWRs, resulting from fears of
plutonium weapons proliferation and from higher
projected costs of plutonium recycling. As a result,
large stockpiles of plutonium will be accumulating,
stored mostly in spent fuel elements. The safe use of
this plutonium is one of the reasons for the current
interest in MSRs in Japan. Preliminary calculations
indicate the possibility of obtaining additional energy
out of spent LWR fuel by dissolving it in a fluoride salt
and burning it in an MSCR.

The fear of weapons proliferation has also spurred
an interest in reactors that do not use highly enriched
fuels and that avoid fuel reprocessing. A recent quite
sophisticated study at ORNL has shown how an MSCR
using thorium as the fertile material but fueled with
20% enriched uranium could be operated for 30 yr
without any processing of the fuel. There would be
periodic additions of the 20% enriched uranium, but no
need to remove fission products other than those
coming off naturally in the gas purge system. Even
under these extreme conditions, the lifetime average
conversion ratio 1s ~0.80. I was personally surprised at
the favorable result of that study, which illustrates
another way that the MSR technology could be used if
fully developed.

A social change within the last few years is the
increased sensitivity of the public to the possibility of
reactor accidents. The MSRs deserve consideration on
this score, especially because catastrophic accidents
appear to be extremely unlikely. Although the entire
primary system of an MSR is highly radioactive, there
1s little driving force to make the activity escape. Thus,
with proper design of the containment, the public
should be well protected.

For the foreseeable future, any newly proposed
reactor must compete with the LWR. Because the
MSCR's fuel cycle cost will be lower, it is possible that
it can compete with the LWR on a cost basis. I believe
the two most important considerations favoring the
MSR, however, are its versatility in being able to use
any fuel and its ability to be ultimately transformed
into a breeder, thus solving the electric power problem
for millennia.

What of the future? The details of the technology
developed for the MSR at Oak Ridge are exceedingly
well documented, and the knowledge, as preserved on
paper, is available to any group wishing to pursue a
new development effort.”® There continues to be a
significant amount of international interest in molten
salts.” "> Sophisticated research on the chemistry and
technology is going on at several Japanese universities
and there is some industrial interest there. A new
engineering development project has been started in
Italy for which I have great hopes. Certain individuals
in France, India, the USSR, and other countries are
strongly interested. It is possible that one of these
centers of interest will persevere and ultimately achieve
commercial success. Mr. Weinberg and I would be
overjoyed.
