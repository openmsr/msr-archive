CHAPTER 5

INTEGRITY OF METALS IN HOMOGENEOUS REACTOR MEDIA*

5-1. INTRODUCTION

The materials problems of aqueous fluid-fuel reactors are among the
most challenging in modern technology. The temperatures of interest
alone involve considerable departures from those areas for which scientific
data and techniques for obtaining such data are available. However, these
difficulties are minor compared with those encountered in the actual en-
vironment ultimately to be dealt with in an operating nuclear reactor.
The radiation which results from the nuclear reactions may profoundly
alter the chemistry of the fluids through the formation and decomposition
of various chemical species; similarly, the corrosion and physical behavior
of materials may be changed by radiation damage and transmutation.
Consequently, materials for reactor construction cannot be adequately
specified until their behavior in the ultimate reactor environment has
been evaluated through in-pile radiation experiments. Such experiments
can, however, be safely and meaningfully carried out only after extensive,
careful out-of-pile investigation of the systems of interest. Thus a com-
prehensive experimental program is required involving facilities ranging
from conventional laboratory apparatus to complex in-pile experiments
with associated remote-handling and evaluation equipment.

The comprehensive character of the program is further justified by the
high cost associated with reactor component failure. This high cost stems
from the problems involved in repairing or replacing highly contaminated
equipment. These problems are, of course, magnified by a failure which
results in a release of radioactivity from the reactor, even though this
release 1s only to a leaktight reactor containment chamber. Thus con-
siderable effort to assure unusual reliability of the reactor system is ap-
propriate.

The corrosion behavior of materials in the fluids of interest has also ap-
preciably increased the scope of the program. Corrosion rates showing
complex time dependence for as long as the first several hundred hours
result from changes in fluid characteristics with time and ‘or the necessity
of forming a protective oxide film. During this period the rate decreases
with time in a quasi-exponential fashion. The corrosion rate then usually

becomes linear and when the materials and environment are compatible
1s normally a few orders of magnitude lower than rates for the initial period.
Flow conditions are also very important variables and so must be considered
in all phases of the program; pump loops have fulfilled this requirement
admirably. This time dependence of the corrosion rate complicates the
interpretation of the data because it is a function of fluid flow, temperature,
and fluid composition. Where tests are run long enough to get good in-
cremental measurements, the resultant linear rates provide a good basis
for evaluating the effects of different variables on corrosion. However,
meaningful corrosion rates cannot be obtained in short-term runs, in which
case a better comparison can be made on the basis of the unit weight loss
over the period. This variable is normally selected for comparing results in
runs less than 200 hr.

5-2. EXPERIMENTAL [CQUIPMENT FOR DETERMINING CORROSION RaTes*

5-2.1 Qut-of-pile equipment. Siatic aufoclaves. A variety of experi-
mental equipment is required to determine the integrity of metals in
aqueous homogeneous reactor media. The simplest apparatus consists of
a glass flask in which various materials may be exposed to reactor fuel
solutions at temperatures up to the atmospheric boiling point. At elevated
temperatures and pressures, a static autoclave designed to withstand the
temperature and pressure requirements is used with conventional or
specially designed furnaces. A large number of tests may be rapidly and
economically made in autoclaves prior to more extensive testing in dy-
namic corrosion test loops. The static autoclaves are used primarily for
solution corrosion tests. Slurry corrosion tests are usually better con-
ducted in equipment which provides agitation or forced circulation in
order to prevent the slurry from settling into a dense bed.

Toroids. The toroid apparatus or rotator [1,2] provides a method of
circulating fluids, as required to obtain data on the effect of fluid flow on
corrosion rates, without the use of a pump. The toroid itself consists of a
length of pipe bent into a circle with its ends joined. Pin-type corrosion
specimens as well as a thermocouple well are inserted into the toroid
through openings around the circumference. Itach pin specimen is held
firmly in a fitting, which also seals the opening in the pipe wall. When the
environment is compatible, a Teflon (plastic) bushing is used to assist mn
holding the specimen as well as to insulate it from the holder. Continuous
pressure measurements may also be taken during operation by means of
small-diameter tubing connecting the toroid to a pressure gauge or re-
corder,

The fluid medium in the partially filled toroid is circulated by im-
parting a motion to the toroid similar to that by which liquid may be
aused to swirl in a flask.

To attain the necessary circular motion, the toroid is attached to a
horizontal mounting plate which, in turn, is attached at its center (by
means of a bearing) to the vertical shaft of a rotator arm. The rotator arm
1s, In turn, mounted on the shaft of a variable-speed motor, as shown in
I'ig. 5-1. The toroid is prevented from rotating about its own axis ‘by
means of a connecting rod installed between the toroid plate and an external
rigid frame. Dynamic balancing of the unit is required for operation at
high speeds (500 to 1000 rpm), and a counterweight is provided for this
5-2] EQUIPMENT FOR DETERMINING CORROSION RATES 201

purpose. Flow velocities up to 30 fps are obtained in the unit now in use.
A heating system, which consists of electric heating wire or elements
wrapped around the toroid, provides for operation at elevated temperature
and pressure. The entire apparatus is relatively inexpensive and fills the
need for a laboratory-scale dynamic corrosion test.

In view of the fractional filling of the toroid, which results in “slug
flow,” corrosion attack rates based on the elapsed time of operation may
be corrected to account for the time of immersion in the circulating fluid.
This is usually required when corrosion rates obtained in a toroid are being
compared with those obtained in the dynamic corrosion test loops described
below,

The toroid rotator can be used in the study of solutions and slurries.
It has been particularly useful for slurries because of the small amount of
material required. The exploration of many slurry variables has been
possible with amounts of material (50 to 100 g) easily prepared in the
laboratory.

out-of-pile tests. One such loop is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 5-2, in

which the flow is divided between a number of parallel channels in which
corrosion test specimens can be exposed. Several sets of specimens may be
exposed to several flow conditions or a larger variety of specimens to a
given set of flow and solution conditions. Loops of various designs have
been constructed for other specific purposes [3,4].

The test loop consists of a circulating pump, pipe loop, and a pressur-
izer. The circulating pump is a Westinghouse model 100A canned-motor
centrifugal type [5]. This pump delivers 100 gpm at a 250-ft-head and
is constructed for operation at pressures up to 2500 psi. The loop and
pressurizer are heated by means of electric elements cast in aluminum
around the outside of the piping.

The loops are usually constructed of 13-in. schedule-80 pipe. Flanged
joints are used liberally in the loop construction to provide easy access for
inspection and for connection of special experimental equipment. Ior
simplicity, economy, and elimination of crevices, a simple butt joint using
lap-joint flanges, bearing rings, and a metal gasket [6] is generally used.
The test specimens are exposed in split-channel holders inserted in flanged-
pipe sections as shown.

The pressurizer, which consists of a vertically mounted section of 4- to
6-in.-diameter pipe, serves several functions. It provides system over-
pressure, contains space for solution expansion in the loop during heatup,

contains space for gas that may be required for solution stability and/or
corrosion studies, and serves as a reservoir for excess solution for samples
removed during operation.

Two types of holders used for exposure of test specimens in the loop are
shown in Fig. 5-3. The pin specimen holder shown is used to test a variety
of materials at a uniform bulk fluid flow velocity. Pin-type specimens
inserted in the holes are exposed to the solution flowing through the chan-
nel when the holder is assembled. Teflon sleeves on the ends of the pins serve
as compressible gaskets to keep the specimens from rattling in the holder
during the test and to insulate the specimens from the holder. Figure 5-3
also shows the specimens and holder used in determining the effect of
velocity on corrosion. In this holder, flat coupon specimens form a con-
tinuous septum down the center of the tapered channel, so the bulk fluid
flow velocity increases as the solution traverses the holder. Velocity-effect
data thus obtained may be used in the design of reactor piping systems if
the data are confirmed by loop experience.

In the dynamic slurry corrosion test loop [7], shown in Fig. 5-4, the
pump discharge flow is directed through the bottom portion of the pres-
surizer to minimize settling and accumulation of slurry particles which
would occur in this region if the pressurizer were connected as in the solu-
tion test loop. As shown in this figure, a condenser is installed in the

pressurizer vapor space to supply clean condensate required to continuously
purge the pump bearings and prevent slurry accumulation, which would

result in excessive bearing wear. The flow of steam or steam-gas mixture

through the condenser is by thermal convection. The condensate thus

produced flows to the rear of the pump as a result of the static pressure dif-
ference between these two points in the system.

A slurry addition device is also incorporated in the loop so that slurry
may be charged at elevated temperature and pressure. This device con-
sists of a reservoir tank connected at its bottom to the main loop piping.
The slurry may be added batchwise to the tank and, after the top flange is
closed, may be forced into the loop by differential pressure, with the slurry
being replaced by an equal volume of water from the condensate system.
A high-pressure rotometer and regulating valve are provided in the addi-
tion system for metering and adjusting this flow of condensate so that flow

[cHAP. 5
5-2] EQUIPMENT FOR DETERMINING CORROSION RATES 205

to the pump hearings is maintained. To ensure purge-water feed to the
pump hearings and to provide positive feed of condensate for the slurry
addition system in the event of a loss of static pressure differential, a
pulsafeeder pump is incorporated in the condensate circuit and may be
used as required.

As an aid in monitoring the density and thus the concentration of the
circulating slurry, venturi type flowmeters with high-pressure-differential
pressure cells are used in the slurry loop.

5-2.2 In-pile equipment. Rocking autoclaves. To obtain information on
the behavior of fuels and materials under reactor conditions, experiments
have been carried out in the Graphite Reactor and Low Intensity Test
Reactor at ORNL and in the Materials Testing Reactor at NRTS [8-12]
using small autoelaves or bombs, The autoclaves used for such tests are
shown mm Fig. 5-5 [9]. The autoclave, in a specially designed container
can and shield plug assembly, is rocked by the mechanism at the face of
the reactor shield. The rocking is designed to keep the solution mixed, to
maintain equilibrium between liquid and vapor phases, and to keep all
surfaces wet. The latter provision prevents the formation of local hot
spots by the high gamma fluxes or localized recombination reaction with
resultant explosive reaction of the hydrogen and oxygen formed by radio-
lytic decomposition of water. The assembly is so designed that the auto-
clave can be retracted into a cadmium eylinder, thereby substantially
reducing the flux exposure. This minimizes the necessity for reactor shut-
downs in case of minor experimental difficulties and is useful for obtaining
data. The necessary electrical and cooling lines are carried to the face of
the reactor shield through the container can and a shield plug. In addi-
tion, a capillary tube, filled with water, connects the autoclave to a pres-
sure transducer gauge. By this means a continuous record of the pressure
in the autoclave is obtained. In cases where a quantitative relationship
exists between the corrosion reaction and consumption or production of a
gas, the pressure measurements, suitably corrected, provide a measure of
the generalized corrosion rate.

Pump loops. An m-pile loop [13] is similar to all forced-circulation
loops; 1t consists of a pump, pressurizer, eirculating lines, heaters and
coolers, and associated control and process equipment. The circulating
pump, designed at ORNL [14-16], 1s a canned-rotor type which delivers
5 gpm at a $0-ft head at pressures up to 2000 psig.

The loop assembly and 7-it-long container are shown in Fig. 5-6. Some
of the physical data for a typical loop are summarized in Table 5-1 [17].
The loop components are usually constructed of type—347 stainless steel,
although one loop has been constructed in which the core section was made
of titanium and another was made entirely of titanium. The loop con-

sudden failure of a loop component. All electrical and process lines are
carried through the pump end of the container through sealed connectors
and then through the shield plug to the “valve boxes” at the face of the
reactor. These valve boxes are sealed, shielded containers in which are
located process lines and vessels, valves, samplers, and sensing devices for

the instrumentation [13]. The equipment in the boxes is used with suc-
cessive loops, whereas each loop is built for a single experiment and com-
pletely dismantled by hot-cell techniques thereafter [18]. Samples of the
circulating solution for analysis are withdrawn through a capillary line
during operation, and reagent additions can also be made if desired. A
capillary connection to the pressurizer is used to follow pressure changes in
the loop and to make gas additions when necessary. As in the case of the
in-pile autoclaves, previously described, the pressure data can be used to
follow a generalized average corrosion rate for all the materials in the loop
as the operation proceeds.

Specimens can be exposed in the pressurizer, in holders in the line just
beyond the pump outlet, and in the core. The specimens in the core in-
side the tapered-channel holder and in the annulus around it are exposed
to the solution in which fissioning is taking place and to direct pile radia-
tion. Duplicate specimens in the in-line holders are exposed to the same
solution in the absence of the fissioning and direct pile radiation. As in
the out-of-pile loops discussed previously, the tapered-channel coupon
holders are used to study velocity effects. The core specimen holder is
shown in place in Fig. 5-7. Figure 5-8 is a photograph of a core corrosion
~pecimen assembly in which can be seen coupled coupons on a rod assembly,
as well as coupons in the tapered-channel holder and stress specimens in
the core annulus. Although not shown, impact and tensile specimens are
also sometimes exposed in the core annulus.

The loops must be adequately instrumented [19] to provide accurate
measurements of loop temperatures, pressurizer temperatures, and pressures
within the loop. The quantity of oxygen and hydrogen in the pressurizer
is obtained from the pressurizer temperature and pressure measure-
ments. Electrical power demands of the loop heater furnish a measure
of over-all fission power and gamma heating within the loop. Since the
loop, in effect, becomes a small homogeneous reactor operating sub-
critically, when enriched fuel solution is being circulated many automatic

Remote-handling equipment. After exposure in the reactor, dismantling
of the loops [18] and autoclaves [20], and subsequent examination of the
test specimens and component parts must be done in hot cells with remote-
handling equipment. Prior to removal from the reactor, the fuel solution
is drained from the loop or autoclave and all radioactive gas is vented.
The loop or autoclave is then withdrawn into a shielded carrier and sepa-
rated from its shield plug to facilitate handling. It is then removed to the
hot cell facilities for dismantling and examination.

The loop in its container can is lowered from its carrier, through a roof-
plug opening, into the cell, where it is clamped in a chuck which rotates
the assembly while a disk grinder cuts off the rear section of the container.
A jib boom is used to withdraw the loop from the container, and various
sections of the loop are then cut out by means of a disk grinder. Figure 5-10
is a photograph of the dismantling equipment in the hot cell.

The severed loop sections are then removed to a remote-examination
facility [21] where the more exacting tasks of removing, examining, and
photographing loop components, as well as weighing individual test speci-
mens, required to determine corrosion damage, are carried out. Hot-cell
techniques are again used, with the aid of specially designed remote-
handling equipment.
5-3] SURVEY OF MATERIALS 211

5-3. SURVEY oF MATERIALS*

5-3.1 Introduction. To determine the corrosion resistance of many dif-
ferent materials to uranium-containing solutions, a large number of
screening tests have been performed. These tests were carried out either
in pyrex flasks at the boiling point of the solution or in stainless steel
autoclaves or loops at 250°C. Oxygen or air was bubbled through the at-
mospheric boiling solutions, whereas at 230°C the test solutions were
pressurized with 100 to 200 psi oxygen. The corrosion rates of the ma-
terials were determined from weight losses of test specimens after the cor-
rosion products had been removed from their surfaces by an electrolytic
descaling process [22]. The results of the tests are presented in the follow-
ing sections. All tests were carried out in the absence of radiation.

The stainless steel designations are those of the American Iron and Steel
Institute. The composition of most of the other materials is listed in
Engineering Alloys [23] and those not so listed are included in Table 5-2.
All the materials were tested in the annealed condition except in the cases
where parentheses follow the alloy designation, in Table 5-3. The num-
ber thus enclosed is the hardness of the material on either the Rockwell
C (RC) or Rockwell B (RB) scale.

5-3.2 Corrosion tests in uranyl carbonate solutions. Since uranium tri-
oxide is more soluble in lithium carbonate solutions at high temperatures
than in solutions of other carbonates, the corrosion resistance of the
materials was determined only in the lithium carbonate system. All cor-
rosion tests were carried out in stainless steel loops at 250°C. The test so-
lution was prepared by dissolving 0.03 moles of uranium trioxide per liter
of 0.17 m Li»COz and passing carbon dioxide through the solution until
the uranium was in solution. The solution was then circulated for 200 hr
in a loop pressurized with 700 psi carbon dioxide and 200 psi oxygen. The
flow rate of the solution was 20 fps. Table 5-3 shows the materials that
were tested and the ranges of corrosion rates that were observed.

Thus the corrosion resistance of all the metals and alloys tested was good
with the exception of aluminum, copper, and most of the nickel- or cobalt-
base alloys. The acceptable alloys developed films that would have pre-
vented further corrosion had the tests been continued longer. Data pre-
sented elsewhere [24] show that even the carbon steels and iron would be
satisfactory materials in carbonate systems. The fact that the carbonate
solution is approximately neutral is undoubtedly the reason for the non-
aggressive nature of the solution.

5-3.3 Corrosion tests in uranyl fluoride solutions. In contrast to uranyl
carbonate solutions, uranyl fluoride solutions are acid, and in general the
corrosivity of the fluoride solutions is much greater than that of the car-
bonate solutions. To determine the relative corrosion resistances of many
different metals and alloys, a 0.17 m UOQ2F2 solution was used. Tests were
performed at 100 and 250°C in static systems and at 250°C in loops. The
static tests were continued for periods up to 1000 and 2000 hr. The dy-
namic tests lasted for 200 hr, and the flow rate of the solution past the
specimens was 10 to 15 fps. The results of the dynamic tests are shown in
Table 5-4.

All the stainless steels except type 416 showed low corrosion rates under
the conditions of test. Other experiments showed that most of the cor-
rosion occurred in about the first 100 hr of exposure, during which time a
protective coating formed on the steel. After the coating formed, corrosion
rates in the range of 0.1 mpy or less were observed (provided the flow rate
was not too high). The static corrosion tests of longer duration verified
the dynamic results. Thus, had the dynamic tests reported in Table 5-4
lasted for 1000 hr, the average corrosion rates would have been approxi-
mately one-fifth of those shown.

At high temperatures, all the stainless steels corrode at high constant
rates if the flow rate of the solution exceeds a certain value which depends
on the concentration of the solution and the temperature (to be discussed
in the next section). In 0.17 m UO3F2 at 250°C this critical value is 20
to 25 fps.
5-3] SURVEY OF MATERIALS 215

As expected, zirconium and zirconium alloys showed no resistance to
attack by uranyl fluoride solutions at high temperatures. In fact, other
tests have shown that as little as 50 ppm fluoride ions in uranyl sulfate
solutions leads to appreciable attack of zirconium [25]. On the other hand,
titanium demonstrated high resistance to uranyl fluoride solutions. Tests
with more highly concentrated uranyl fluoride solutions have shown the
corrosion rate of titanium to be low. The titanium alloys showed higher
rates, ranging from 5 to 8 mpy. However, in crevices where oyxgen de-
pletion occurs, titanium and its alloys are severely attacked [26].

No nickel- or cobalt-base alloys were tested under dynamic conditions.
Those tested at 250°C in autoclaves include D Nickel, Chromel P, Stellite
98M2, and nickel; all showed rates in excess of 18 mpy during 1000- to
2000-hr tests. At 100°C nickel corroded at a rate greater than 100 mpy and
Monel corroded at 7 mpy; the other above-listed materials, Elgiloy,
Hastelloys C and D, Ilium R, and Inconel, corroded at rates less than
1.5 mpy.

Gold, platinum, and tantalum were practically unattacked by the
uranyl fluoride at 250°C; the resistance of tantalum was unexpected.
Niobium was heavily attacked.

It is seen from the foregoing that several metals, including most of the
stainless steels, have adequate corrosion resistance to uranyl fluoride solu-
tions if the flow rate of the solution is not too great. Uranyl fluoride cannot
be used in a two-region reactor, however, because zirconium and uranyl
fluoride solutions are incompatible. Another possible difficulty of uranyl
fluoride solutions in any system is the fact that the vapor above the acid
uranyl fluoride system may contain some hydrofluoric acid which, if pres-
ent, would present a serious corrosion problem.

5-3.4 Corrosion tests in uranyl sulfate solutions. Many corrosion tests
discussed in detail in HRP progress reports [27] have been carried out in
uranyl! sulfate solutions under different conditions of temperature, uranium
concentration, flow rate, etc. Table 5-5 shows representative corrosion
rates of a number of materials obtained in 0.17 m UO2S04 at 250°C in
stainless-steel loops during a 200-hr. exposure. The flow rate of the solu-
tion past the specimens was 10 to 15 fps. Static tests, the results of which
are not included in the table, have also been carried out at 100 and 250°C
and generally lasted for 1000 to 2000 hr. The results obtained in static
systems generally confirmed the dynamic results, although the corrosion
rates observed in static systems were less than those measured in dynamic
systems.

The data presented in Table 5-5 show only the relative corrosion re-
sistance of different classes of alloys and need further clarification. From
the results reported in the table, and from many other static and dynamic

tests of longer duration, the following conclusions can be drawn. All the
austenitic stainless steels except SRF 1132, 316, and 316L behaved essen-
tially alike; all corroded rapidly and uniformly for about the first 100 hr,
during which time a protective coating formed (provided the flow rate was
less than 20 fps). Once the film formed, corrosion rates less than 0.1 mpy
were observed. The extent of attack during film formation varied some-
what from run to run, and there was no consistent difference from one
austenitic stainless steel to the other. Thus, even though the rates re-
ported in Table 5-5 are high, the continuing rates are very low; as a class,
the austenitic stainless steels are satisfactory materials for containing
uranyl-sulfate solutions at reasonable flow rates. Types 316 and 316L
showed a tendency toward intergranular attack, and SRF 1132 did not
develop a highly protective coating.

Of the ferritic and martensitic stainless steels, types 410, 416, 420, and
440C in all heat-treated conditions were completely unsatisfactory. The
corrosion rates of these alloys were nearly constant with time, and the
attack was very irregular. Although the precipitation-hardenable steels,
322W, 17-4 PH, and 17-7 PH, showed very low corrosion rates after the
formation of the protective film, all displayed a tendency toward stress-
corrosion cracking in their fully hardened conditions. Croloy 16-1 demon-
strated reasonable corrosion resistance in short-term tests, but long static
tests showed the material to be susceptible to intergranular attack in
uranyl sulfate solutions. The other ferritic and martensitic stainless steels
corroded in the same fashion as did the austenitic stainless steels; that is,
after a protective film formed the corrosion rates were in the range of
0.1 mpy. From a corrosion standpoint these materials have adequate cor-
rosion resistance for use in high-temperature uranyl sulfate solutions.

Titanium, zirconium, and all of their alloys were extremely resistant to
‘attack by uranyl sulfate solutions at all concentrations, temperatures, and
flow rates. In fact, corrosion damage was so small that it was difficult to
detect weight changes of the specimens with a standard analytical balance.
These alloys will be discussed further in Sections 5-5 and 5-6.

Most of the nickel- and cobalt-base alloys listed in Table 5-5 were
rapidly attacked by high-temperature uranyl! sulfate solutions. The two
exceptions were Hastelloy R-235 and Elgiloy. Hastelloy R-235 resembled
an austenitic stainless steel in that it developed a film and corroded prac-
tically no further. Although Elgiloy corroded only slightly, it was ex-
tremely susceptible to stress-corrosion cracking in high-temperature
uranyl-sulfate solutions. Thus, of the alloys listed, only Hastelloy R-235
could be considered for use in high-temperature uranyl sulfate solutions.
On the other hand, most of the alloys were resistant to uranyl sulfate solu-
tions at 100°C; corrosion rates less than a few tenths of a mpy were ob-
served. It is particularly significant that many of the very hard alloys,
218 INTEGRITY OF METALS IN HOMOGENEOUS REACTORS [cHAP. 5

such as the Stellites, are resistant at the lower temperature; in many ap-
plications, such as pump bearings, temperatures no greater than 100°C
are required.

In dynamic tests platinum and gold were resistant to attack under all
conditions, but ntobium corroded at an appreciable rate, about 7 mpy at
15 fps. The corrosion rate of niobium depended on the flow rate of the so-
lution, and at higher flow rates somewhat higher corrosion rates were
observed. Static tests showed that tantalum and chromium are corroded
only slightly under most conditions. If the solution contained dissolved
hydrogen, tantalum was seriously embrittled; highly oxygenated uranyl-
sulfate solutions at temperatures above 250°C oxidized chromium to the
soluble hexavalent state, and under these conditions the rate of attack
was several mils per year.

A number of nonmetallic substances were statically tested in
0.17 m UO2504 at 100°C. Those tested included various grades of sintered
alumina and graphite, sapphire, silicon carbide, sintered titania and zir-
conia, and quartz. All corroded at rates of less than 3 mpy, except for one
very impure grade of sintered alumina which corroded at 124 mpy. In
fact, the corrosion resistance of the sintered alumina was higher, the higher
the purity. In static tests at 250°C in 0.17 m UO280y4, the corrosion rate
of pure sintered alumina was 3 mpy; sapphire corroded at the rate of
3.6 mpy. In dynamic tests under the same conditions, sapphire corroded at
17 mpy, quartz at 58 mpy, and Pyrex glass at 730 mpy. The high corro-
sion rates of quartz and Pyrex glass show why glass-lined equipment can-
not be used for high-temperature experimental work. In addition to the
attack on the glass, the resultant silicates cause precipitation of uranium.

5-3.5 Conclusions. Type-347 stainless steel has been the basic material
of construction in most homogeneous reactor programs. It has serious
limitations, particularly from the corrosion standpoint, but in considera-
tion of the additional important factors of cost, availability, and experi-
ence with Its use, it appears a suitable material. The excellent corrosion
resistance of titanium and several of its alloys makes them very useful in
special applications, particularly where the limitations of the stainless
alloys make their use impractical. Cost, availability, and a recently ob-
served autoignition reaction in oxygen-containing environments are
serious limitations to the use of titanium in pressure-containing equipment
(see Article 5-8.5). Zirconium and zirconium-rich alloys are unique ma-
terials for the core vessel of a two-region breeder.

The behavior of these materials in homogeneous reactor fluids is de-
scribed In detail in subsequent sections of this chapter.
54] CORROSION OF TYPE-347 STAINLESS STEEL 219

5-4. CorroSION OF TyPE-347 STAINLESS STEEL IN URANYL SULFATE
SOLUTIONS*

5—4.1 Introduction. The decision to use type-347 stainless steel as the
major material of construction and a uranyl sulfate solution as the fuel
for HRE-1 and HRE-2 was based, at least in part, on the demonstrated
compatibility of the two components and on the fact that the technology
of the austenitic stainless steels was well developed. Articles 54.2 through
54.7 present the results of an extensive investigation of the corrosion of
type—347 stainless steel in uranyl sulfate solutions in the absence of ionizing
radiation, and in Article 54.8 the effect of ionizing radiation on the cor-
rosion of stainless steel is discussed. Further details are reported in the
HRP quarterly progress reports [28].

All the results reported in this section were obtained with solutions con-
taining between 50 and 1000 ppm oxygen to prevent reduction and pre-
cipitation of uranium; the precipitation of uranium as U3Og leads to the
formation of ‘sulfuric acid which attacks stainless steel at a very high rate
at the temperatures of interest. A consequence of these phenomena 1s the
possibility of localized attack in crevices where oxygen depletion can
occur. Other forms of localized attack have been investigated, but except
for stress-corrosion cracking in the presence of chloride ions (discussed
in Section 5-9) no serious problems have arisen. Thus, even with un-
stabilized stainless steels that have been sensitized by appropriate heat
treatment, no severe intergranular attack in uranyl-sulfate solutions oc-
curs. The coupling of such noble metals as gold and platinum to type-347
stainless steel does not result in accelerated attack of the stainless steel.

5-4.2 Effect of temperature. When type—347 stainless steel is placed in
a uranyl-sulfate solution at temperatures up to 100°C, the steel retains its
metallic luster, and only after long periods of time does it develop a very
thin tarnish film. At higher and higher temperatures the film becomes pro-
gressively heavier, and in the temperature range 175 to 200°C a quite
heavy black scale forms on the surface of the steel in about 100 hr. Up to
about 175°C the film that forms is nonprotective, and the corrosion rate is
dependent on the composition of the solution and independent of the flow
rate past the steel surface. Some typical corrosion rates in this temperature
range are presented in Table 5-6.

*By J. C. Griess.

Experience indicates such occurrences are minimized by maintaining at least
500 ppm oxygen in solution. Careful attention to elimination of crevices in the
system design is essential.

The heavy film that forms in the temperature range 175 to 225°C offers
some protection to the underlying steel, but in most cases the protection
is poor. At higher temperatures a heavy scale forms fairly rapidly on the
stainless steel, and once it has been established it affords essentially com-
plete protection against further corrosion, provided the flow rate of the
solution ig not too great.

The protectiveness of the film appears to be related to its composition.
At temperatures up to 175°C the scale, as determined by x-ray diffraction,
1s composed of mixed hydrated ferric and chromic oxides. At higher
temperatures the amount of hydrated oxide decreases, and the amount of
anhydrous alpha ferric oxide containing chromic oxide in solid solution
increases. At 250°C and higher, only the anhydrous oxide is found in the
protective scale,

The amount of metal that dissolves during the period of film formation
depends primarily on the flow rate, the composition of the solution, the
temperature, and the presence of additives. If the other variables remain
constant, increasing the temperature decreases the amount of metal that
is corroded during the formation of the protective coating and reduces
the velocity effect,

54.3 Effect of solution flow rate. From room temperature to about
175°C the solution flow rate has essentially no effect on the corrosion rate
of the stainless steel. However, at temperatures of 200°C and above, the
corrosion rate is profoundly influenced by flow rate. Figure 5-11 shows

typical results obtained using a tapered-channel specimen holder in a
stainless steel loop. The data were obtained from a series of runs in which
0.17 m UO2804 was circulated at 250°C for various times. Since at low
flow rates the corrosion rate depends on time, weight loss rather than cor-
rosion rate is used as the ordinate.

At flow rates up to about 20 to 25 fps all weight losses were nearly the
same regardless of exposure time. Between 25 and 35 fps weight losses in-
creased sharply, and at still higher low rates the weight loss of the speci-
mens was proportional to the exposure time. An examination of the speci-
mens revealed that up to about 20 fps the specimens were completely
covered with a black, relatively heavy, tenacious scale which, after it
formed, practically prevented further corrosion. In the region of 25 to
35 fps there were areas of the specimens that remained free of scale. At
flow rates greater than 40 fps the specimens did not develop any visible
scale, and upon removal from the holder the specimens had the appearance
of severely etched steel.

Although the results presented in Fig. 5-11 are for only one concentra-
tion of uranyl sulfate, a similar velocity effect is observed at all uranyl-
sulfate concentrations and at all temperatures above 200°C. The tempera-
ture of 200°C is in the middle of the transition region below which velocity
is unimportant and above which a velocity effect is observed. Therefore,
at 200°C a velocity effect is observed but is not well defined. Usually all
specimens, even at the highest flow rate, develop a black coating which
222 INTEGRITY OF METALS IN HOMOGENEOUS REACTORS [cHAP. 5

gives partial protection. In addition, the extent of the velocity effect is
dependent on the exposure time.

The velocity below which a completely protective scale forms is defined
as the critical velocity. The weight loss of stainless-steel specimens above
this velocity increases linearly with time, and the corrosion rate is con-
stant. Below the critical velocity the stainless steel corrodes initially at
the same rate as at the high velocities, but the rate decreases as the pro-
tective coating forms and, generally, after about 100 hr very little, if any,
corrosion occurs. In fact, some specimens have been exposed continuously
at flow rates less than the critical velocity for periods of time as long as
20,000 hr and the amount of metal corroded was no greater than after
100 hr [29].

5-4.4 Effect of uranyl! sulfate and sulfuric acid concentration. All
uranyl-sulfate solutions are acid, and the more concentrated the solution,
the lower the pH as measured at room temperature. The acidity is further
increased by adding sulfuric acid to dilute uranyl sulfate solutions to
prevent hydrolytic precipitation of copper and uranium at high tem-
perature.

(Generally, the higher the concentration of uranyl sulfate or free acid in
solution, the greater the extent of metul dissolution during film formation
below the critical velocity, the lower the critical velocity, and the higher
the film-free corrosion rate above the critical velocity, Table 5-7 shows
how the above three regions change with uranyl-sulfate concentrations
at 250°C.

Figure 5-12 shows the effect of sulfuric acid added to 0.04 m UQ2804
containing 0.005 m CuSOy4, on the amount of metal dissolved during film
formation and on the critical velocity of the system. The effect of adding
sulfuric acid is qualitatively the same at all uranyl sulfate concentrations
and at all temperatures above 200°C and produces a result similar to that
of increasing the uranyl sulfate concentration. Thus it can be concluded
that the acidity of the solution determines, at least in part, how much
metal dissolves before a protective coating forms, and the critical velocity
of the solution. It has been found that low concentrations of copper sulfate
in uranyl! sulfate solutions have no significant effect on the corrosion of
type-347 stainless steel.

5-4.5 Temperature dependence of flow effects. It has been stated that
increasing the flow rate of the solution generally produces a detrimental
effect on the corrosion of type—347 stainless steel. This effect is temperature-
dependent, as shown in Fig. 5-13. Although the results are based on a
0.17 m UO2S04 solution, an increase in temperature has a similar effect
at all concentrations. With a given solution composition (i.e., constant

uranyl sulfate and sulfuric acid concentrations), increasing the tempera-
ture decreases the amount of metal that dissolves during film formation,
increases the critical velocity, and increases the film-free corrosion rate of
the stainless steel. The reasons for these effects are discussed in Article

4.7.

5-4.6 Effect of corrosion inhibitors. The number of substances that
can be added to uranyl sulfate solutions to serve as corrosion inhibitors is
limited for two reasons: (1) all organic inhibitors are oxidized to carbon
dioxide in high-temperature oxygenated uranyl sulfate solutions, and
(2) many inorganic compounds are insoluble in uranyl sulfate solutions.
In spite of the second limitation, a number of inorganic salts have been
added to uranyl sulfate solutions to determine their effectiveness in re-
ducing the corrosion of type-347 stainless steel. Those substances that
have been tested include: LiaSOy4, NapSO4, BeSO4, MgSOs, AgoSOy,
CuS0y4, Cra(S04)3, NiSOy4, FeSO4, MnSOy4, Ce(S04)2, [Ru(NO)]2(8504)s,

Of the compounds listed, only potassium dichromate and certain of the
sulfate salts of the alkali and alkaline earth metals have been effective,

Fic. 5-14. The effect of Cr(VI) in 0.17 m UO2504 on the corrosion of type—347
stainless steel.

Chromium (VI) was effective even at very low concentrations, whereas the
sulfate salts had to be present in amounts nearly equal in molality to the
uranyl sulfate.

The addition of chromium(VI) to high-temperature uranyl sulfate
solutions reduces the amount of metal corroded during film formation,
greatly increases the critical velocity, but materially mcreases the corrosion
rate of the stainless steel at flow rates in excess of the critical velocity.
Results obtained using coupon-type corrosion specimens in a loop through
which 0.17 m UO2504 was circulated at 250°C indicated that 200 ppm
chromium (VI) increased the critical velocity from 20 to 25 fps to between
50 and 60 fps [30]. Other tests were carried out in which two pin-type
specimens were exposed for 100 hr at flow rates both above and below the
critical velocity in 0.17 m UO2S04. The results are presented in Fig. 5-14.
The corrosion rates at 70 fps are true rates which would not change on
continued exposure; those at 12 fps are average rates for the 100-hr ex-
posures and would decrease. Had the exposure been for 200 hr, the rates
would have been approximately half those shown. It should be noted that
as the film-free corrosion rate increased, the average corrosion rate at the
low flow rate decreased.

It has been found that the presence of added sulfate salts in nearly
equimolal concentration appreciably reduced the corrosion by concentrated
226 INTEGRITY OF METALS IN HOMOGENEOUS REACTORS [cHAP. 5

uranyl sulfate solutions. The salts that have been studied the most are
beryllium sulfate, lithium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate. The phase
stability [31] of the above solutions has been reported, as have the corrosion
results [32-34]. For example, the weight loss for a 200-hr exposure of
stainless steel in 2.0 m UO2S04 containing 2.0 m LioSO4 at 200°C was
only 5 mg/cm? for velocities up to 60 fps. This may be compared with
100 mg/cm? for exposure to a 1.3 m UO2504 solution under similar con-
ditions. The effect of lithium sulfate was less pronounced at 250°C and
high velocities; at 250°C and 50 fps, weight losses were approximately 70
and 400 mg/cm? respectively, for solutions of these same concentrations.
For flow velocities less than 30 to 40 fps initial weight losses were found
to be in the range of 5 to 15 mg/em? for equimolal concentrations of uranyl
sulfate and lithium sulfate up to 4.4 m and temperatures up to 350°C.

In dilute uranyl sulfate solutions the addition of sulfate salts also reduces
the corrosion of stainless steel, but at temperatures of 250°C and higher
the solutions are chemically unstable and complex hydrolytic precipitates
form. At lower uranyl sulfate concentrations (0.04 to 0.17 m) the solutions
demonstrating the greatest stability are those containing beryllium sulfate,
and of the three sulfates most investigated, the least stable of the solutions
were those with lithium sulfate. Sulfuric acid can be included in such
solutions to prevent precipitation, but in so doing some of the effectiveness
of the sulfate salt is lost. However, addition of both lithium sulfate and
sulfuric acid to dilute uranyl sulfate solutions has been found to result in
improved corrosion resistance of zirconium alloys on in-pile exposure [33].

5-4.7 Qualitative mechanism of the corrosion of stainless steel in
uranyl-sulfate solutions. Although any proposed mechanism for the cor-
rosion of stainless steel in uranyl sulfate solutions at high temperatures
must be considered qualitative, from a study of the effects of several vari-
ables on corrosion and from visual observation of high-temperature solutions
sealed in quartz tubes, certain conclusions can be drawn and the over-all
reaction processes determined.

The austenitic stainless steels and most other metals and alloys of
practical importance in large-scale homogeneous reactors are thermo-
dynamically unstable in aqueous solutions and depend on protective films
for their corrosion resistance. Iortunately, when austenitic stainless
steels are oxidized in high-temperature uranyl sulfate solutions, the steel
oxidizes uniformly so that no element (or elements) is leached preferentially
from the alloy. However, not all the alloying elements contribute to film
formation.

The oxidation and reduction processes of the corrosion reaction can be
considered separately, with the oxidation reactions {considering only the
major alloying elements) represented in the following manner:
54] CORROSION OF TYPE-347 STAINLESS STEEL 227

Ie, Cr, Ni —> Fe(II) + Cr(ITT) 4+ Ni(II) +e", (5-1)
Fe(IT) — lie(I11) +e. (5-2)

Both iron (IT) and nickel(IT) are soluble in uranyl sulfate solutions to an
appreciable extent at high temperature, but if an oxidizing agent more
powerful than uranyl ions is present, the reaction indicated by Eq. (5-2)
takes place. [Manganese(ll) also remains in solution.]

The half-reaction for the reduction can be any of the following, depending
on the conditions:

Os + 411+ + 47 —> 2H 20, (5-3)
UO2(IT) + 4H + 20~ —> U(IV) 4 2H:0, (5-4)
Ot + 2 —> 11a. (5-5)

In most concentrations of uranyl sulfate at temperatures greater than
200°C {and probably even at somewhat lower temperatures), iron (III),
chromium(III), and uranium(IV) are present in solution only briefly
before hydrolyzing in the following manner:

OFe(I1T) + 31.0 — Fex03 + 6H, (5-6)
2Cr(I1L) + 3H20 —> Crs03 + G+, (5-7)
U0(I1) + UAV) + 4H20 — U0 + SH. (5-8)

In a system containing oxygen the total reduction process is represented
by Eq. (5-3), although it is highly probable that other ions enter into the
reaction mechanism. Only in the absence of oxygen is either U3zOg or
hydrogen found in the system.

If we examine the equations as written, it is apparent that the over-all
corrosion of stainless steel in uranyl sulfate solutions containing oxygen
can he represented by the sum of Egs. (5-1), (5-2), (5-3), (5-6), and (5-7),
taking into account the percentage of each element in the alloy. Irom the
over-all reaction it can be seen that the amount of oxygen consumed can
be used to measure the quantity of stainless steel corroded. In addition,
since the nickel originating from the corrosion process remains soluble, the
total quantity of stainless steel oxidized can be determined from a knowl-
edge of the nickel content of the uranyl sulfate solution. Measurements of
nickel content and oxygen consumption have been found to agree well
with weight loss for determining total corrosion. Since the nickel remains
soluble and replaces hydrogen ions, the pH of the solution slowly increases
as corrosion proceeds.

In a system depleted in oxygen, uranium is reduced and precipitated as
U30s, producing hydrogen ions while ferrous ions remain soluble. Conse-
quently, a pH measurement gives an indirect measure of the presence or
absence of oxygen in the system. Similarly, the presence of ferrous ions
even in very small amounts indicates a deficiency of oxygen and that
uranium is beginning to precipitate from the solution.
228 INTEGRITY OF METALS IN HOMOGENEOUS REACTORS [cHAP.

Once an anhydrous protective coating has formed on the surface of the
stainless steel, the steel corrodes at an extremely slow rate. However,
since the oxide coatings are thick, it is probable that they are under stress,
and fine cracks or imperfections form. When the film-free metal at the
base of the crack is exposed to the solution, the metal again corrodes actively
until the corrosion produets repair the crack. During extended periods of
testing, this process is probably repeated many times over the surface of
the specimen, with the net observable result being a uniform attack of the
specimen.

In the proposed mechanism of film formation, both iron and chromium
form 1ons before undergoing hydrolysis and crystallization on the surface
of the stainless steel. This mechanism can account for the existence of a
critical velocity, since ions and hydrolyzed particles can diffuse into the
circulating stream before forming the film if the diffusion layer is too thin.
Since the diffusion-layer thickness depends on the flow rate or turbulence,
the process of film formation is, in essence, in competition with diffusion
and turbulence. The eritical velocity, then, is that flow rate (or turbulence)
at which the diffusion layer is reduced to such an extent that most of the
corrosion products get into the main circulating stream before they can
form on the surface of the stainless steel. Under conditions where the
rates of dissolution and hydrolysis are fast, the critical velocity would be
expected to be relatively high.

It has been mentioned that solutions of uranyl sulfate are acid and that
the higher the uranyl sulfate concentration, the lower the pH of the solu-
tion. Also, data have been presented to show that the higher the uranium
concentration, the greater the corrosion rate of film-free stainless steel.
These two factors essentially work against each other with regard to film
formation; that is, & high corrosion rate would introduce relatively large
concentrations of corrosion products into the solution in the immediate
region of the stainless steel surface, a factor which should facilitate the
formation of a protective film. But even though more corrosion products
are present, the hydrogen ion concentration is also substantially greater.
Since hydrolysis reactions are very dependent on the hydrogen ion con-
centration, the rate of film formation is actually retarded, so that the net
result is the dissolution of more stainless steel at high uranyl sulfate con-
centrations than at lower concentrations before a protective film is formed.
Because the process of film formation is slower the higher the uranyl sulfate
concentration, the critical velocity is also lower the higher the uranyl
sulfate concentration.

Since the presence of sulfuric acid in uranyl sulfate solutions also de-
creases the rate of hydrolysis, the addition of sulfuric acid has about the
same effect as increasing the uranyl sulfate concentration.

The effect of temperature on the formation of a protective coating can
5-4] CORROSION OF TYPE-347 STAINLESS STEEL 229

be accounted for by considering the effect of temperature on the rate
at which the corrosion products are formed and on their rates of hydrolysis.
Increasing the temperature increases the rate at which corrosion products
enter the solution and also the rate of hydrolysis, with the net result that
films form faster and that the critical velocity is increased. Because the
initial corrosion rate and the rate of precipitation are fast, it would be
expected that the crystallite size of the oxide would be smaller the higher
the temperature of formation, and this has been found to be true. Appar-
ently a compact layer of small crystals forms a more protective and ad-
herent coating than one composed of large erystals.

It is probable, though seemingly paradoxical, that chromium(VI) serves
as a corrosion inhibitor, at least under certain conditions, because it acceler-
ates the film-free corrosion rate of stainless steel. In this respect, the effect
of adding chromium(VI) to uranyl sulfate solutions is similar to that of
increasing the temperature. Because of the increased corrosion rate, large
quantities of corrosion products are formed near the surface of the stainless
steel, and hence the solubility limit of the oxides is exceeded rapidly and
many small crystals form on the surface of the stainless steel. Even though
the rate of hydrolysis is not increased as it is at the higher temperatures,
the diffusion rate is slower, so that the corrosion products are in the vicinity
of the stainless steel longer. Because the film forms faster, the critical
velocity is higher in the presence of chromium (VI) than in its absence, other
variables remaining the same.

The reason why the addition of relatively large quantities of inert
sulfate salts to uranyl sulfate solutions reduces the corrosiveness of the
resulting solutions is not known, but may be due to one of a number of
factors, such as the formation of stable complexes, reduction of acidity,
changes in oxidizing power, increased viscosity and density, or changes in
colloidal properties of the oxide.

5-4.8 Radiation effects. The effect of radiation on the corrosion be-
havior of stainless steel is important in relation to the use of this material
in construction of the fuel-circulating system and reactor pressure vessel of
a homogeneous reactor. The radiation levels thus encountered, however,
are considerably less than for the zirconium core tank. For example, the
fission power density of the solution in contact with the stainless steel in
the HRIE-2 will not exceed 1 kw/liter for operation at 10 Mw, and in a
large-scale two-region breeder or single-region burner reactor would not be
more than 5 kw/liter. These values may be compared with fission power
densities of up to 50 kw/liter at the surface of the zirconium core tank.

The corrosion behavior of type-347 stainless steel in uranyl-sulfate
solutions under irradiation at high temperature has been studied in a

*By G. H. Jenks.
230 INTEGRITY OF METALS IN HOMOGENEOUS REACTORS [cHAP. 5

number of in-pile loop and in-pile autoclave experiments. A few scouting
type experiments of the effect of van de Graaff electrons on steel corrosion
have also been carried out. Although most of the information for the radia-
tion effect on steel has its source in these experiments (in particular, the
loop experiments), information of a general nature has been derived from
the performance of the stainless steel portion of the HRE-1.

With loop experiments, specimens were located in the core portion of
the loop and in portions of the loop external to the core and out of the
high-flux region [30], as shown in Fig. 5-6 (Article 5-2.2). Coupons and
other specimens exposed in these latter positions are designated “in-line
specimens.” Specimen preparation, in general, comprised only cleaning
after machining. However, prior to radiation exposure, each experimental
system, including the specimens, was exposed first to water, with or without,
oxygen, and then to oxygenated uranyl sulfate solution at a temperature
near the test temperature [37]. Corrosion attack of a specimen was deter-
mined from weight-loss measurements, visual inspection, and metallo-
graphic examination. The course of corrosion of the system during exposure
in both loops and autoclaves was followed by measuring the rate of oxygen
consumption. The approximate operating conditions and other experi-
mental information for the loop tests are shown in Table 5-9 (Article 5-5.3).
All the loops contained steel specimens except those otherwise indicated.
Experiment [.-2-14 contained only a few steel coupons. A detailed de-
scription of methods and procedures employed with the in-pile tests is
presented in Article 5-5.3.

The behavior of steel under exposure to a solution in which fissioning is
occurring in the immediate neighborhood of the surface appears to change
appreciably with changes in experimental conditions. No comprehensive
picture of the behavior is available as yet, and only the general features of
the experimental results can be reported. Pits of 1 to 2 mils in depth,
which appear to spread laterally and merge (with increasing attack), are
usually found on the surfaces of specimens which have suffered appreciable
attack [38]. After the merging of pits, the attack appears to proceed
fairly uniformly over a surface.

Average corrosion rates which have been determined for core specimens
in 0.17 m U02504 solution plus varying amounts of HaS04 and CuSOyq
varied between 0.1 and >180 mpy for solution power densities up to
5 kw /liter and for solution velocities up to 45 fps [39]. These rate values
for specimens and the other rates quoted below are based on exposed
specimen areas and radiation time.

With the exception of the results of two experiments, the rates observed
at power densities below 2 kw/liter were less than 2 mpy. In one of the
experiments, L-4-8, for which the results are an exception of this generali-
zation, a specimen exposed to a solution power density of about 2 kw/liter
54] CORROSION OF TYPE-347 STAINLESS STEEL 231

and an average solution velocity of about 40 fps exhibited a rate of 40 mpy.
The pattern of the results in this case indicated that the high solution
velocity was, in part, responsible for the high rate. In the other experi-
ment, DD, rates varying from 2.5 to 57 mpy at solution power densities
from 0.3 to 1.7 kw/liter and solution velocities from 10 to 40 fps were
observed. This experiment was the first of the series of loop experiments.
The higher rates in this loop may have been associated with the exceptional
solution conditions. Only a small amount of excess acid was added initially,
and it was estimated that this excess was consumed in the solution of
nickel produced in corrosion during the course of the experiment. This
solution condition was not repeated in subsequent experiments [40].

No significant acceleration of corrosion has been observed with specimens
exposed at in-line positions in the loops; that is, at positions in which the
sample is not exposed to neutrons but is exposed to solution which has
passed through the core. Average corrosion rates for in-line specimens were
less than 2.3 mpy for all cases considered. These in-line specimens were
exposed to solution velocities in the range of 10 to 40 fps, but no significant
effect of velocity on the corrosion rate was observed [41]. However, in
one experiment, L-4-12, a single pit was observed in the surface of the
recessed shoulder of the volute inlet of the pump, a high-velocity region
[42]. It should be noted that the rates mentioned are based on the loss in
weight of a specimen during exposure as measured after a cathodic defilming
treatment. The oxide is not always removed quantitatively in this treat-
ment. Weight gains were frequently observed for in-line specimens, and
in these cases the rate of attack was assumed to be zero.

The results of the experiments with van de Graaff electrons have not
shown any significant effect of electron irradiation on the corrosion of
type—347 stainless steel by uranyl sulfate solutions at the high temperatures.
One of these experiments, carried out in a type-347. stainless steel thermal
siphon loop, was with an oxygenated 0.17 m U02304 solution at 250°C.
The intensity of electron irradiation was such that the estimated power
density from absorption of electron energy in solution adjacent to the
specimen was 20 to 30 kw/liter. Two exposures, each of 50-hr duration,
were made, and no significant difference was observed between the attack
of irradiated and nonirradiated specimens [43]. The other experiment
was conducted in a titanium thermal loop with an oxygenated solution,
0.04 m UO2804, 0.025 m HoS04, and 0.01 m CuSO4 at 280°C. The
estimated power density due to absorption of electron energy adjacent
to the specimen was about 60 kw/liter. Again no significant difference
between the attack of irradiated and nonirradiated specimens was noted
in a 50-hr exposure [44].

It has been suggested that chemical changes in solution due to fissioning
and/or the radiation from fission-product decay, both of which would be
232 INTEGRITY OF METALS IN HOMOGENEOUS REACTORS [cHAP. 5

proportional to the total fission power averaged over the total solution
volume of the high-pressure system, might have an adverse effect on the
behavior of the stainless steel located in the regions external to the core.
In loop experiments at average power densities up to 1.5 kw/liter, no
such effect was apparent. The only available information on the corrosion
of type-347 stainless steel at higher average power densities is that from
the HRE~1. In this case the maximum average power density was about
14 kw/liter, and the over-all stainless steel corrosion rates (including the
core tank) were 6 to 8 mpy as judged from data for total nickel in
solution [453].*

The influences of some of the variables on the corrosion hehavior of
stainless steel under exposure to a fissioning solution, as indicated by the
results to date, are listed and summarized as follows:

Fission power density. Corrosion is accelerated by exposure to fissioning
uranyl sulfate solution, and the degree of acceleration increases with
increasing fission power density in solution. In several experiments, reason-
ably good proportionality was found between the fission power density
to which a specimen was exposed and the logarithm of the average corrosion
rate of the specimen during exposure.

Excess H2S04. One interpretation of some of the results is that the
optimum concentration of excess H2S0, is between 0.01 and 0.02 m, and
that concentrations above and below these limits may have an adverse
effect on in-pile corrosion.

Velocity of solution at specimen. There is some evidence that the in-pile
rate increases with increasing solution velocity.

Radiolytic-gas pressure. A possible interpretation of some of the results
is that the in-pile rate is diminished as the concentration of radiolytic gas
in solution increases.

Galvanic effects. The possibility of galvanic effects on corrosion under
some in-pile conditions has not been ruled out.

Temperature. In general, the attack observed at 250°C was greater and
less predictable than that observed at 280°C.

5-5. Rapiation-INpucep CORROSION OF ZIRCALOY—2 AND ZIRCONIUMT

5-5.1 Introduction. Crystal-bar zirconium and Zircaloy-2 have been
tested at elevated temperatures in uranyl sulfate solutions under dynamic
and static conditions in the absence and in the presence of radiation. Both

similar attack rates.

5-5] RADIATION-INDUCED CORROSION 233

the metal and alloy are very corrosion resistant in the absence of radiation.
However, under exposure to nuclear radiations, particularly those from
fissioning uranium solution, corrosion rates may be appreciably greater
than those observed out-of-radiation. Although most of this section will
be concerned with the in-pile studies, some of the out-of-pile tests will also
be described.

5-5.2 Corrosion of Zircaloy-2 and zirconium in uranyl sulfate solutions
in the absence of radiation. Most of the radiation-free experiments were
of the type in which specimens of the metal to be tested were exposed in
autoclaves or loops constructed of stainless steel or titanium. The uranyl
sulfate solutions were oxygenated and usually contained excess H»SO4.
CuSO4 was also added in some tests. Cleaned, as-machined specimens
were employed. Under exposure to the uranyl sulfate solutions at high
temperature, the specimens generally formed a black, tightly adhering
film within 100 hr. These films could not be removed without damage to
the metal, and the amount of corrosion was estimated from the weight of a
specimen together with the oxide.

Zirconium and Zircaloy-2 specimens exposed in solutions circulating in
stainless steel systems collected some of the stainless steel corrosion prod-
ucts (iron and chromium oxides) in an outer layer of scale. This outer
layer could be removed partially by a cathodic defilming operation. A
sodium hydride bath treatment was required for complete removal.
Table 5-8 lists values for long-term average corrosion rates observed in a
solution 0.04 m in UO02804, 0.02 m in HaS0y4, and 0.005 m in CuSOy4 at
200, 250, and 300°C.

These rate values were calculated from the decrease in weight of de-
filmed specimens as measured following an initial exposure period of several
days. Other tests gave similar results at uranyl sulfate concentrations from
234 INTEGRITY OF METALS IN HOMOGENEQUS REACTORS [cHAP. 5

0.02 to 1.3 m. No evidence for appreciable acceleration of attack during
exposure was observed during tests of up to 20,000 hr.

A few experiments with Zircaloy-2 were carried out in autoclaves similar
to the in-pile type [46] described in Article 5-2.2. In these experiments,
the autoclave was constructed of Zircaloy-2 and was charged with the
test solution, oxygen gas, and specimens. The test surfaces were as-
machined and cleaned. Corrosion during exposure was determined by
measuring the rate of oxygen loss within the system. The results of two
of these experiments, H-54 and 11-55, are shown graphically in Fig. 5-15,
where the thickness of the layer of metal which was converted to oxide or
removed by oxidation is plotted on a log-log plot versus the exposure time.

Data reported by Thomas [47] on the behavior of Zircaloy—2 in de-
aerated water at temperatures of 290 and 315°C, when converted into
values for the thickness of the layer of oxidized metal, are similar to those
for H-54 and H-55. The water data at 315°C are illustrated in Fig. 5-15
by the dotted line. From these results, it appears that the out-of-pile
behavior of Zircaloy-2 in oxygenated uranyl sulfate solutions is similar to
that in deaerated water in the temperature region investigated.

5-5.3 Methods and procedures employed with in-pile tests. In-pile in-
vestigations were carried out with autoclaves and loops (described in
Article 5-2.2). A majority of the autoclave experiments and all the loop
experiments were conducted in the Low Intensity Test Reactor at ORNL.
The maximum thermal-neutron flux available for these experiments was
about 2 xX 10'3 neutrons/ (cm?) (sec).

For most experiments, the autoclave and the corrosion specimens were
constructed of the metal to be studied. The autoclave was partly filled
with the solution to be tested, pressurized with oxygen, and stirred by
rocking. Measurements of the oxygen pressure in the system during ex-
posure provided imformation regarding the course of corrosion.

Most of the in-pile loops were constructed of type-347 stainless steel;
however, In one experiment the loop was of titanium, and in another the
core portion only was of titanium. Corrosion specimens were placed in the
core and in a portion of the loop which is outside the region of appreciable
neutron flux. The specimens in the latter position were usually duplicates
of the core specimens. The over-all corrosion behavior during exposure
was followed by measuring the rate of oxygen consumption within the
system, and by chemical analysis of solution samples which were with-
drawn from time to time. Specimen examination included visual and me-
tallographic inspection, and weight measurements. The exposure conditions
and composition of test solution which prevailed for each of the in-pile
loop experiments are listed in Table 5-9. Unless otherwise noted, all tests
were run with a light-water solution of 0.17 m UQ2804 in a type-347

included air at atmospherie pressure within the system. Solution analyses
after irradiation indicated that most of the nitrogen from this air was
fixed mn solution in some oxidized form with possible concentrations (if
all NOz 7) up to or about 0.05 m [49].

The usual preparation of specimen surfaces consisted of cleaning after
machining. Before exposure to radiation, the systems, with specimens,
were first subjected to high-temperature water, with or without oxygen,
and then to the uranyl sulfate solution at temperatures near the test tem-
perature. The Joop systems were exposed to solutions of normal uranyl
sulfate before the exposure to the U?35-enriched uranyl sulfate solutions.

The thermal neutron flux to which a Zircaloy—2 specimen was exposed
while in-pile was determined by measuring and comparing the amount of
the induced activities, Zr?>—Nb%, in the specimen and in a control sample
of Zircaloy—-2. The latter was irradiated together with a cobalt monitor in a
separate experiment in which the specimen and cobalt did not contact
solution. or some experiments which contained steel specimens, similar
measurements were made utilizing the Cr®! activity. The fission power
density in the uranium solution adjacent to a specimen was calculated
from the resulting value for the thermal flux together with the value for
the fission cross section of uranium, assuming 200 Mev per fission.

Recently, comparisons have been made between values for the flux
indicated by cobalt monitors within the test system and by Zircaloy-2
within the same system. The flux values determined from the cobalt
were about 25%; less than those from Zircaloy—=2. The cobalt values may
be more valid, but the consistency between Zircaloy—2 results has been
good, and the Zircaloy—2 values are employed throughout in presenting
the results [50].

lixperimental conditions other than those summarized above have been
employed, and some of these will be mentioned later.

5-5.4 Results of in-pile tests with Zircaloy-2 and zirconium. The re-
sults of autoclave experiments have demonstrated that the corrosion rate
of Zircaloy-2 under irradiation at a given set of exposure conditions does
not change with the time of exposure, in contrast to out-of-pile behavior.
Two 1n-pile autoclave experiments, H-57 and H-58, plotted in Fig. 5-15,
lustrate this [51]. The lines through the plotted points for tests under
radiation exhibit a slope of 1, and those for out-of-pile experiments, a slope
of about 0.4. In both cases the values for penetration are those calculated
from the results of oxygen consumption measurements. It was assumed in
the calculations that corrosion of the exposed surfaces in the autoclave
238 INTEGRITY OF METALS IN HOMOGENEOUS REACTORS [cHAP, 5

was uniform and that oxygen was lost only in the formation of ZrO.
These assumptions appear to be generally valid for the in-pile cases. The
corrosion penetration calculated from weight changes of specimens was
usually in near agreement with the penetration calculated from oxygen
data. A pitting type attack was detected in only one of the numerous
specimens which have been exposed [52]. The cause of pitting in this case
is unknown.

The time scale which is employed for the radiation experiments is
cumulative time with the reactor at power. During exposure of a given
experiment, the reactor was frequently at zero power for appreciable
periods. It has been observed in autoclave experiments that a penetration
of from 0.005 to 0.01 mil takes place after shutdown and that, following this,
corrosion essentially stops until power operation is resumed. The corrosion
which takes place during shutdown appears to delay the onset of attack
when irradiation is reinstituted; the amount of delay about balances off the
additional attack which occurs during shutdown. In view of this behavior,
the practice has been adopted of using radiation time only in calculating
corrosion rates [53].

The oxide which is found on Zircaloy-2 surfaces under irradiation 1s
markedly different from that formed outside of radiation. The in-pile
specimens which are removed from the autoclaves are covered with a
relatively heavy brass-colored scale. This scale cracks and flakes off to
some extent upon drying. When a specimen is immersed in acetone and
then air-dried at 100°C, the scale flakes off almost quantitatively [54]; re-
maining scale can be removed by cathodic defilming. The specimen sur-
faces after defilming generally exhibit a dark-gray color and, in some
cases, interference colors. In-pile loop specimens, on the other hand, ap-
pear to be free of heavy scale of the type found in autoclaves. There 1s
usually a dark-brown-colored scale on the surfaces, the amount of which
is greatest for specimens exposed at the lowest power densities. The scale,
of unknown composition, can be removed in a cathodic defilming opera-
tion [55].

Chemical analyses of heavy scale on autoclave specimens revealed that
they contain several percent by weight of uranium and copper in addition
to zirconium. Sulfate is found in some scales [56]. Core specimens from
loop experiment, L.-2-17 have been analyzed for uranium as removed from
the loop. Twenty micrograms of uranium per square centimeter were
found on the surface of a specimen exposed in a location at which the solu-
tion velocity was about 1 fps. Five micrograms per square centimeter
were found on a specimen exposed at a solution velocity of about 30 fps [57].

Average corrosion rates during exposure to radiation have been calculated
from the observed loss in weight and the exposed specimen area, not in-
cluding areas in close contact with adjacent specimens or covered by the

specimen holder. In some cases, where specimens had different ratios of
total to exposed areas, results indicated that the rate of attack of the cov-
ered areas was nearly the same as that of the exposed areas. However, use
of only the exposed area gives more conservative values. For most of the
loop specimens, the ratio of total to exposed area was about 1.6, and in
autoclaves the ratio was nearly 1.

Loop results obtained with 0.17 m UO2S04 solutions but with other
conditions varying are illustrated in Fig. 5-16 [58]. Except for relatively
minor variations, the solutions for the experiments represented by curves
A, B, and C were the same. Experiment L-2-14, curve ££, was with a
solution containing 0.4 m HaSO4 and 0.15 m CuSO4 as additives.  Ex-
periment 1.—4-18, curve D, was with a D»0 solution. Channel specimens
were exposed to solution velocities in the range 10 to 40 fps; annulus
specimens to velocities of about 1 fps. Where annulus type specimens were
employed, they usually exhibited rates somewhat greater than the channel
specimens. The annulus type specimens in loop L-2-15 (curve C) represent
the maximum difference observed in 0.17 m U0,80,4 solutions. No dif-
ference between channel and annulus specimens was observed In experi-
ments 1.—4-18 and L-2-14 (curves D and F). The 280°C data represented
by line B follows the equation

R= 1.04P(1 — e958"), (5-9)

where R = rate in mpy, and P = power density in kw/liter. The data
for 250°C (line A) follow the equation

R= 1.25P(1 -— pO BIRISY (5-10)

The derivation of an equation of this general form is given in Article 5-5.6.
Data represented by the other curves are considered insufficient to justify
representation by specific equations.

Results obtained with loop experiments with 0.04 m UO250 4 solution
(I.-2-10 and 1-2-17) are illustrated by the curves in Fig. 5-17 [539]. A
portion of line 53 from Fig. 5-106 is included in Fig. 5-17 for comparison.
Corrosion rates for channel specimens in this solution are greater at the
same power density than those for specimens in 0.17 m UQ2S04 solutions.
The shape of the curve through the channel data is also different. As will be
discussed later, these channel data may be interpreted in terms of a bene-
ficial effect of solution velocity on corrosion. The approximate locations
of specimens in the channel with respect to the power density to which the
specimen was exposed and the average velocity of solution at the specimen
are indicated in Fig. 5-17. The annulus specimens, which were exposed at
low solution velocities, corroded at higher rates than the channel specimens.
5-5] RADIATION-INDUCED CORROSION 241

The results of autoclave experiments at 250°C (curve A, Fig. 5-16) with
solutions of the same general compositions as those listed in Table 5-9,
but with 0.04 m excess HoS04 [60], followed Eq. (5-10), developed for
250°C" loop data. The rates obtained in autoclave experiments with similar
solutions at 280°C [60] followed the equation

R= 136P(1 — ¢= 95/8") (5-11)

which illustrates that the rates were somewhat greater than those obtained
with loop channel specimens at 280°C (curve B, Fig. 5-16). In autoclave
experiments with solutions of the same general composition but with no
excess HoS0y4, the data at 250°C [60] followed the equation

R=2.9P(1 — ¢=6-5/R1%), (5-12)
and the data at 280°C followed the equation
R=213P(1 — ¢ 93/82), (5-13)

Rates obtained with 0.04 m U0250, solutions in autoclaves were in ap-
proximate agreement with the values observed for annulus coupons in
loop experiments with 0.04 m solutions (Fig. 5-17) [60]. The effects of
changes in some other variables on the in-pile rate are described below:

Time. As mentioned previously, the rates under irradiation appear to
remain fairly constant with time.

Oxygen and hydrogen. No effect has been noted of changing the pressure
of hydrogen within the test limits, 0 to 350 psi, and of oxygen within 150 to
900 psi.

CuSOy4. CusOy concentration apparently has little effect on the rate.
The results of one autoclave experiment, Z—-17, in which no copper was
employed confirmed this behavior [61].

Nitrogen. The presence or absence of air at atmospheric pressure in the
autoclave when sealed apparently has little effect on the rate [62].

Other solution variables. The presence of Li=S0y as an additive in the
uranyl-sulfate solution has resulted mn a decreased radiation effect mn some
autoclave experiments [63]. No appreciable effect on the rate has been
noted for other solution additives such as CrOz and KTeOy [64]. An
experiment to which MoOs was added indicated an adverse effect for this
material in solutions [64].

Other materials.  Crystal-bar zirconium was tested in several loop and
autoclave experiments. Observed corrosion rates were in near agreement
with those for Zircaloy—2.
242 INTEGRITY OF METALS IN HOMOGENEOUS REACTORS [cHAP. 5

Chemically polished* specimens of Zircalov—-2 and crystal-bar zirconium
corroded at rates about 10% lower than the as-machined specimens.

Other zirconium alloys have been tested in some experiments, but only
one of these alloys, Zr-159% Nb, has exhibited appreciably better resistance
than Zircaloy—2. This niobium alloy has been tested in several loop and
autoclave experiments. In the beta-quenched condition, it corroded at
rates lower than those observed for Zircaloy—2 by factors of from 3 (run
L—4-11) to 1.5 (run I.-2-17) [63].

Zircaloy-2 autoclave experiments in the LITR and MTR reactors with
solutions which contained U02S04 depleted of U2 have exhibited an
acceleration of corrosion over that expected out-of-radiation. In these
tests, absorption of fast neutron and gamma rays gave rise to a power
density in solution of about 6 kw/ liter in MTR experiments and 0.6
kw/liter in the LITR experiments. In each reactor, about one-half of the
power was from gamma-ray and one-half from fast-neutron absorption. At
280 to 300°C! the observed rates were about 1 and 4 mpy at the lower and
higher powers, respectively [66].

5-5.5 Tests of the effect of fast-electron irradiation on Zircaloy-2 cor-
rosion. The effect of fast electrons from a van de Graaff accelerator on the
corrosion of Zirealoy—2 by uranyl sulfate solutions has been tested in
experiments at 250 and 300°C. In both cases the specimens were mounted
in a small thermal siphon loop constructed of titanium. Employing elec-
trons with an initial energy of 1.5 Mev and currents in the neighborhood of
2% 104 (em?) (sec), the experimental arrangement was such that an
electron traversed approximately one-half of its range before impinging on
the specimen. The estimated power density due to absorption of beta-ray
energy in the solution adjacent to the specimen was 60 to 90 kw/liter in
each experiment. The duration of exposure was 40 hr at 250°C and 60 hr
at 300°C. No significant acceleration of the corrosion due to irradiation
was found in either case [67].

5-5.6 Discussion of results of radiation corrosion experiments. The
results of the radiation experiments presented above suggest that the
radiation effect on the corrosion of Zircaloy—2 by uranyl-sulfate solution
is not directly associated with changes in solution under irradiation. If
the radiation chemistry of these solutions at high temperature is not greatly
different from that of acid solutions near room temperature, the yield of
H-atoms and OH radicals in solution from beta and gamma radiation 1s
at least as great as that from heavy particles [68]. Since radicals produce
marked changes in reactions, rather than the molecular products Ho and

*50¢7, H20, 4597 concentrated HNOs, and 5¢ HIT (48%).
5-5] RADIATION-INDUCED CORROSION 243

Og, corrosion effects due to changes in solution would be as pronounced
for beta-gamma radiation as for heavy particles. However, no effect of
beta radiation was observed. It was also mentioned that no effect has been
observed of varying Hz and QO» pressures in in-pile autoclave experiments.
Thus the primary action of the radiation is in the metal or its protective
oxide film, or both, probably through the formation of interstitials and
vacancies by heavy nuclear particles. Beta-gamma radiations can also
produce interstitials in such materials, but with considerably less efficiency.
The number of such defects produced by an electron in the energy range
employed in the van de Graaff experiments may be expected to be a factor
of 100 or more less than the number produced by a 1-Mev neutron [69].
Hence the rate of defect formation by the electrons was small compared with
the rate of formation by fast neutrons in the depleted U02S0, in-pile tests.

On the basis of these considerations and of the various experimental
observations, a qualitative model of the radiation corrosion of Zircaloy-2
has been developed, from which an equation relating fission power density
in solution and corrosion rate has been derived [70]. The equation has the
general form

R= AP(1—e BIR), (5-14)

where £ is the corrosion rate, I’ is the fission power density, and A and B
are constants. This equation is derived as follows.

Under exposure to heavy-particle radiation, the protective oxide film
forms on the metal as it does out-of-radiation, and the kinetics of the pro-
tective oxide formation are about the same in and out of radiation. Under
irradiation, however, the film does not continue to increase in thickness.
Radiation produces defects of unspecified nature in the protective oxide,
and in the presence of these defects, the oxide breaks up and/or reacts
with the solution to form a nonprotective scale. The rate at which the
protective oxide breaks up is proportional to the concentration of defects
in the oxide at the oxide-solution interface. Under these conditions, a
steady state is established in which oxide is removed at a rate equal to the
rate of formation and in which a steady-state thickness of film results.
The corrosion rate is determined by the rate of transfer of reagents across
this film. The defects are produced at a rate proportional to the intensity
of radiation and are removed by thermal annealing at a rate proportional
to the concentration of defects. In the derivation of the general equation,
it was assumed that the rate of oxidation of the metal, £2, at a given pro-
teetive film thickness, X, 1s given by

R=C/X2 (5-15)

where Cis a constant.
244 INTEGRITY OF METALS IN HOMOGENEOUS REACTORS [cHAP. 5

In considering the effect of solution composition and flow velocity on
the radiation corrosion of Zircaloy~2, a number of interesting phenomena,
related apparently to the sorption of uranium on or near the protective
film, were observed. Some of these effects are illustrated in Fig. 5-17,
hased on data from runs L-2-10, L-2-17, 1-416, and L-2-15 listed in
Table 5-9. As shown in Ilig. 5-17, at a given solution power density the
corrosion rate was greater in 0.04 m UO2804 than in 0.17 m UO2504,
and the degree of difference was less in high-velocity regions (30 to 40 fps)
than in low-velocity regions (10 fps). The low-velocity (1-fps) annulus
specimens in the 0.04 m solutions were attacked at markedly higher rates
than the channel specimens. The addition of 0.04 m excess H230y to the
0.17 m U02304 solutions in autoclave experiments had a beneficial effect
at a given solution power density. The addition of a greater amount of
excess H280y4 (0.4m) to the 0.17 m UO2S04 in loop experiment L-2-14
also produced a beneficial etfect.

It appears likely that most of these solution and velocity effects are
associated with the sorption of uranium on the surface of the test speci-
mens. As mentioned previously, uranium is usually found in the scale
from specimens exposed in autoclave experiments. The amount of this
uranium is less for specimens exposed to solution with 0.04 m excess HoS04
than for those exposed to solutions with no acid. One to two per cent
uranium by weight is usually found for specimens exposed under the
former conditions, and 5 to 69%, under the latter condition. It has been
found that the autoclave results in the different solutions can be inter-
correlated as well as correlated with the loop results if a corrected power
density, P,, rather than the power density in solution is employed [71].
In this correlation, which is empirical, the corrected power density Is
assumed to be given by the expression

P.=P,+ K'NUj, (5-16)

where U; is the percentage uranium in the scale, NV is the thermal neutron
flux, P, is the power density in solution, and K’ is a constant. Since I,
is related to N through the uranium concentration in solution, Us, the
equation may be written:

 

p= P(1 + 5) (5-17)
U,

The curve expressed hy Tog. (5-9) was assumed for the relationship between

power density in solution and corrosion rate in the absence of scale at

280°C. The constant, K in Iiq. (5-17) was evaluated from the best fit of

the 280°C autoclave data to the curve. The same value of the constant

was found to apply in fitting the 250°C-autoclave data to lig. (5-10),
56] CORROSION BEHAVIOR OF TITANIUM AND ALLOYS 245

which represents the line drawn through the results of the 250°C-loop
experiments. On the basis of these correlations— that is, when the corrected
power density is employed—it appears that there is no appreciable dif-
ference between the corrosion rate in autoclave solutions containing
0.04 m H2504 and in those free of excess acid. There 1s also no difference
between 0.17 m and 0.04 m U0O2S04 solutions in autoclave experiments.

The fact that the autoclave data can be correlated with the loop data
represented by Eqs. (5-9) and (5-10) is of questionable significance, since
it 1s not known whether the rates in the 0.17 m UO2S04 loop experiments
were influenced by sorbed surface urarium. As mentioned previously, the
loop specimens are usually free of heavy scale of the type found in auto-
claves. However, uranium was found on specimens from the L-2-17 ex-
periment, which was with a solution 0.04 m UO2804, and it appears
likely that uranium sorption on a given Zircaloy—2 specimen was respon-
sible for an appreciable fraction of the total corrosion attack on the given
specimen both in this experiment and in experiment L-2-10 [72]. Since a
greater amount of uranium was found on the surface of the low-velocity
annulus specimen than on the high-velocity core channel specimen, it is
also likely that differences in the amount of uranium which is sorbed at
different velocities resulted in the apparent beneficial effect of increasing
solution velocity [72] in these 0.04 m UO2304 experiments.

5-6.1 Introduction. The corrosion behavior of commercially pure tita-
nium and of titanium alloys has been tested at elevated temperatures in
uranyl-sulfate solutions under dynamic and static conditions mm the ab-
sence and mn the presence of radiation. The equipment and testing pro-
cedures employed were 1dentical with those employed in tests of Zircaloy—2
and type-347 stainless steel described previously.

Of the various in-pile loop experiments listed in Table 5-9, all but those
designated DD, GG, and FEF were concerned in part with titanium cor-
rosion. In addition to the n-pile tests, one scouting-type experiment was
made of the effect of {ust electrons from a van de Graaff accelerator on the
corrosion of titanium-73A in a small thermal siphon loop constructed of
titanium.

5-6.2 Corrosion of titanium and titanium alloys in uranyl sulfate solu-
tions in the absence of radiation. The commercially pure titanium and
the titanium alloys developed a tightly adhering film under exposure which
exhibited interference colors ranging from tan to deep blue or black, de-
pending upon the alloy and upon conditions and length of exposure. This
film could not be removed without damaging the metal. Titanium speci-
mens exposed in uranyl sulfate solutions circulating in stainless steel loops
collected some of the stainless steel corrosion products (iron and chromium
oxides) in an outer layer of scale which could be removed electrochemically.

The average corrosion rates of commercially pure titanium alloys
(45A, RC-55, 75A, 100A, 150A) in a solution 0.04m UO280y,
0.02 m H2S04, and 0.005 m CuSO4 at 200, 250, and 300°C in the absence
of radiation were less than 0.1 mpy. Under similar conditions, high-strength
titanium alloys (containing 39; Al, 239, Sn; 39% Al, 59 Cr; 695 Al, 49, V;
49%, Al, 49, Mn) exhibited corrosion rates up to 0.4 mpy; one alloy
(Ti+ 897 Mn) showed only 0.05 mpy at 300°C. These rate values were
calculated from the decrease in weight of specimens as measured in long-
term tests following an initial exposure period of several days. The speci-
men in each case was descaled electrochemically prior to the final weighing
but, as described above, some film remained on the specimen, As shown
by the results, the commercially pure titanium is very resistant to attack.
The high-strength titanium alloys are slightly less resistant, and corrosion
rates increased with increasing temperature. Other tests have shown
similar corrosion rates at uranyl sulfate concentrations from 0.02 to 1.3 m.

5-6.3 Corrosion of titanium and titanium alloys in uranyl sulfate solu-
tion under irradiation. Specimens exposed in the core of m-pile loops were
coated with an adherent bronze-colored film which could not be removed
without damage to the metal. In some loop experiments, the bronze film
was overlaid with a dark-brown scale similar to that found on Zircaloy-2
specimens and was thickest for those specimens exposed at the lowest
fission power densities [73] as for Zircaloy-2. This scale was partly re-
moved from the titanium and alloys by a cathodic defilming operation
prior to final weighing. The value for the corrosion rate of a core specimen
was calculated from the loss in weight during exposure as indicated by
final weighing, the exposed area, and the radiation time (see Articles 5-5.3
and 5-5.4).

The results obtained with core specimens from in-pile loop experiments
shown in Fig. 5-18 [74] indicate the spread of experimental data over the
range of conditions investigated (Table 5-9). Some of the available ex-
perimental values at low power density and low corrosion rates have been
omitted from Fig. 5-18. Most of the data shown were obtained with
Ti-55A. For this material, the results indicate that the corrosion rate

in-pile 1s greater than that expected out-of-pile and that the in-pile rate
increases slightly with increasing fission power density. There is no sig-
nificant effect of exposure temperature within the range investigated. A
few re=ultx suggest that high solution velocities had an adverse effect on
the in-pile corrosion, but other results show no such adverse effect. It is
possible that fretting between specimens and holder was responsible for
the additional weight loss of those specimens which indicated the adverse
velocity effect. It should be noted that the amount of scale retained by a
specimen after descaling can and may affect the apparent corrosion rate
of the specimen, and differences in the amount of scale retained by different
specimens may influence the apparent corrosion behavior with respect to
the variables power density, velocity, and temperature. The few results
available for titanium alloys indicate that, with the exception of the Ti-69%;
Al-49% V in experiment 1.-2-14, these materials corroded at rates which
are about the same or only slightly greater than those for Ti-35A under
the same conditions. The rates for the Ti-69% Al-4% V in L-2-14 were
about double those for Ti-55A.

The corrosion rate of Ti-535A in in-line positions outside the radiation
field was found to be in the range of 0 to 2.5 mpy [74]. These results indi-
cate that, in general, the corrosion of titanium exposed in in-line positions
of a loop is greater than expected in the absence of radiation, which out-of-
pile tests showed to be about 0.03 mpy or less. The rates determined from
specimen weights were generally less than those observed with specimens
exposed in the core, although in some experiments the maximum rate ob-
served for in-line specimens was about the same as that observed for core
specimens. Differences between the amount of scale retained by in-line and
core specimens after descaling may account, in part, for the apparently
lower rates of in-line specimens.
248 INTEGRITY OF METALS IN HOMOGENEOUS REACTORS [cHAP. 5

The results of in-pile autoclave experiments indicated corrosion rates
under irradiation which are in general agreement with those determined in
in-pile loop experiments. The oxygen pressure measurements in autoclave
experiments indicate that the rate of attack remains constant at a given
set of in-pile conditions [75].

The van de Graaff experiment employed a solution 0.04 m UQO2SOs4,
0.02 m in excess HoS04, and 0.01 m CuSO4 at a temperature of 300°C.
Exposure to fast electrons was for a period of 50 hr and at an intensity such
that the estimated power density due to elettron absorption was about
60 kw/liter in solution adjacent to the specimen. No evidence was ap-
parent that the corrosion of the Ti—75A was accelerated appreciably during
the irradiation [76].

5-7. Aqueous SLURRY CORROSION

The studies reported in this section indicate that corrosion-erosion prob-
lems of high-temperature (250 to 300°C) aqueous oxide slurry systems may
be satisfactorily controlled. However, under unfavorable conditions very
aggressive attack has been noted.

Aqueous slurry corrosion problems in nuclear reactors were studied in
the early days of the Manhattan Project, as reported by Hiskey [77] and
Kirshenbaum [78]; in Great Britain’s Harwell laboratory [79]; and in
the Netherlands’s KEMA laboratory [79]. Slurry corrosion problems are
now being studied for the Pennsylvania Advanced Reactor by Westing-
house Corporation [80], and at Oak Ridge National Laboratory [81-83].

Most of the work described below has been done at the Oak Ridge Na-
tional Laboratory and is summarized in the reports cited above. Most of
the circulating corrosion tests have been carried out at temperatures of
approximately 250 to 300°C in stainless steel equipment.

5-7.1 Nature of attack. Faclors involved in the corrosion-erosion problem.
Slurry attack may be regarded as simultaneous abrasion and high-
temperature water corrosion. Information on the high-temperature cor-
rosion of materials by water in nuclear reactors is discussed in the Cor-
rosion and Wear Handbook [8G], by I. Scheib [87], and for other systems
in the Corrosion Handbook [88]. This serves as a basis for the considera-
tion of similar aspects of attack by aqueous slurries.

For the practical utilization of circulating aqueous slurries, a suitable
balance must be made between corrosion-erosion attack of materials of
construction and handling properties of the slurry, including viscosity,
heat transfer, settling, resuspension, and caking characteristics. The ma-
terials of construction, operating conditions, slurry characteristics, and

properties of the thoria or other material used to prepare the slurry all
exert important influences on the corrosion-erosion problem. All these
factors are important in certain circumstances, and their effect has fre-
quently been found to depend strongly on the presence or level of other
factors. Considerations of such interactions should not be neglected;
however, the strongest factors in attack by aqueous slurries appear to be
particle size, abrasiveness, and degradation susceptibility, flow velocity
and pattern, and metal composition. Important secondary factors include
temperature, atmosphere, slurry concentration, and additives. The effect
of radiation, particularly fissioning, is expected to interact strongly with
such other variables as flow and type of gaseous atmosphere.

Materials of interest. The materials of interest in aqueous slurry systems
for nuclear reactors include many of those considered for high-purity
aqueous high-temperature systems in the Corrosion and Wear Hand-
book [8G]. Although materials found to be unsatisfactory in the purely
aqueous system are usually not suitable for slurry systems, the order of
excellence and the relative importance of different variables has been found
to be altered in slurry systems. Most of the materials and alloys investi-
gated were the same as tested in aqueous uranyl sulfate solutions described
previously. Results for classes of materials are summarized as follows:

The austenitic stainless steels represent the most useful class of con-
struction material for slurry systems. Of the various types available,
type-347 has been tested most. Differences between various types do
not appear to be significant.

It appears possible to reach corrosion rates considerably below 1 mpy
with flows of 20 fps. The most severe attack of stainless steel has been
localized attack noted on pump impellers and housings, orifice restrictors,
and test specimens in high-velocity regions.

Ferritic and martensitic stainless steels are attractive for certain oper-
ating parts because of their hardness properties. The corrosion resistance
of these materials is about the same as that of the austenitic stainless
steels and slightly better in a number of cases. Because certain alloys
of this class do not appear to be susceptible to stress-corrosion cracking
as are austenitic stainless steels, they remain potentially a very useful
class of materials.

Carbon steels or low-alloy steels are of interest because of their low
cost. Results based on corrosion specimens in systems at high oxygen
concentrations, or with hydrogen added, indicate comparatively high
attack rates decreasing with time, and it is possible that acceptable rates
will be achieved. However, pitting problems and potential embrittle-
ment by hydrogen or alkali have not been explored. The effect of chro-
mate from corrosion of stainless steel by slurries with high oxygen con-
centrations in a combined carbon steel-stainless steel system has not
vet been determined.
250 INTEGRITY OF METALS IN HOMOGENEOUS REACTORS [cHAP. 5

Nickel alloys appear to perform somewhat better in hydrogenated
systems but generally are not so corrosion resistant as the austenitic
stainless steels in oxygenated slurries. Inconel and Inconel X appear to
give results approaching austenitic stainless steel in some circumstances.

Stellites have performed best in hydrogenated systems. Attack by
high-temperature oxygenated slurry appears to be due to simple aqueous
corrosion,

Titanium and tts alloys in oxygenated slurry have shown approximately
the same corrosion rates as the austenitic stainless steels. In alkaline
systems with hydrogen atmosphere, very severe attack has been noted.

Zircontum alloys, especially Zircaloy—2, have shown extremely good
corrosion resistance relative to other materials. Fairly severe attack in
a high-velocity wake region by a very abrasive thoria slurry has been
noted.

Noble metals have been tested along with other types to assist in
evaluating the effects of pure erosion. To a rough approximation the
ratio of attack rates on the platinum and gold is constant over a wide
range of conditions, as suggested by Hiskey [89].

Tantalum, In one test at 21 fps, gave results comparable to platinum.
Bronze and aluminum were severely attacked by high-temperature
aqueous slurries. Synthetic sapphire and aluminum oxide were severely
attacked at high flow velocities by high-temperature aqueous thoria
slurries, and pins of thoria densified by the addition of 0.50; Ca) disin-
tegrated under similar conditions.

Types and mechanisms of attack. The attack by aqueous slurries on
metals under nuclear reactor conditions may be treated as a succession of
stages: (a) collision of slurry particles with the surface, (b) damage to the
surface, and (¢) reaction of the underlying metal with the aqueous phase.
Particles may be caused to strike the surfuce by impingement, hy eddy
action, or by shear forces.

Impingement attack, which is noticed on upstream surfaces of objects in
line of flow, in piping elbows, ete., is visualized as resulting from a break-
through of flow lines by slurry particles as the direction of flow 1s changed
on meeting an object. Attack primarily results from impact of the larger
slurry particles with the surface. An example 1s shown in fig. 5-19.

Impingement target efficiency [90-93] 1s estimated as a function of the
dimensionless separation number VoDi(ps — p)/18uDy, where Vy is relative
slurry velocity, D, is dimension of obstructing body, D, is particle diam-
eter, pu 1s fluid viscosity, p, is solid density, and p is slurry density. A
sigmoid curve of target efficiency versus the logarithm of separation num-
ber was obtained for various shapes with 35 to 809% target efficiency at a
separation number of 1, and with a limiting value of separation number,
0.06 for cylinders, below which impingement does not occur. Application

of this concept by Thomas [94] to aqueous thoria slurry at 250°C indi-
cated that flow at 26 fps past a cylinder of 0.1 in. diameter would result
in no impingement by particles below about 3 microns.

Corrosion rate would by this model be proportional to concentration,
velocity, target efficiency, and erosivity [95] (the mass of metal removed
per unit mass of particles striking the metal surface). Erosivity would be
expected to be a function of the flow characteristics, particle energy and
abrasiveness, and other properties of the particle and the metal, although
a general formula for it has not been developed.

The results of the impingement concept should apply to attack on all
surfaces obstructing flow lines of the slurry. This type of attack will be
sensitive to equipment size effects.

Eddy attack 1s noted on pump impellers and housings, high-velocity
test specimens, pipe walls, and other similar regions. [It is characterized by
relatively deep-gouged pits in the direction of flow, quite smooth on the
bottom, or by a deep general polishing. The pits are frequently undercut
to the downstream side so that they feel smooth in the direction of flow
and rasplike in the reverse direction. Attack due to wakes, cavitation, or
flow separation is more localized. It is frequently possible to associate the
localization of the attack with some change in the flow pattern. It has
been observed downstream from protruding weld beads, on the down-
stream side of pin test specimens, on the rim of pump impeller shrouds, on
pipe walls downstream from a flow Interruption, between adjoining coupon
test specimens, ete. An illustration of such attack on a pump impeller is
given in Fig. 5-20.

Fic. 5-20. Eddy corrosion of stainless-steel pump impeller by thoria sturry.

Pits resulting from eddy attack may become quite deep, with depths of
100 mils having developed in a stainless steel pump-impeller shroud edge
(not shown) in 1000 hr.

Eddies can be caused by high velocity, high rates of shear, cavitation,
wake effects, and flow separation and may result in breakthrough of the
flow boundary layer [96-97].

It would appear that in some sense the impingement model above might
still apply to eddy erosion, with larger particles being thrown to the outer
circumference of an eddy. The edge velocity of the eddy would be at least
equal to the fluid velocity at the point of eddy origin. The postulation of a
lower limit on eddy size has been noted [98]. Small eddies might become
trapped in surface imperfections, leading to continuing localized attack.
Wake effects are similar to the cavitation erosion studied in water tunnels
by Shalnev [99], in which the initiation of cavitation in the wake of circular
objects 1s attributed to eddies. Eddy attack will be very sensitive to equip-
ment shape and streamlining effects.

Low shear attack is a relatively gentle, low-velocity attack such as might
be observed on pipe walls, coupon specimen surfaces parallel to the direc-
tion of flow, ete. It is presumed to result from a reduction in thickness of
the protecting boundary layer as flow velocity increases. As indicated by
Johnstone and Thring [100], this type of attack would be sensitive to
scale-up effects, becoming less severe at equivalent Reynolds number as
the flow-channel dimensions are increased. It is also likely to be sensitive
to water corrosion effects.

Relatively thin colored films (less than 1 mg/em?) characteristic of
5-7] AQUEOUS SLURRY CORROSION 253

water corrosion are normally observed in aqueous slurry systems. In
many cases, especially when a substantial quantity of electrolyte is present,
a bright polished surface has been observed. With slurries having particle
sizes near their degradation minimum, there appeared to be no decrease in
corrosion rate with time, which implies that the outer portions of the pro-
tective oxide film were being removed by the flowing slurry as fast as it
was formed.

"actors involved in surface damage to oxide film or metal proper by 1m-
pinging particles are complicated. Hardness, elasticity, strength of the
oxide film or metal, and the nature of the metal-to-oxide bond are 1m-
portant. Impact energy, its localization by particle sharpness, and its
transfer due to particle hardness and strength, are also important. Rosen-
berg and others [101-103] noted that sharp sand was about four times as
erosive to steel (in an air blast) as larger, more rounded sand. For many
slurries in toroid or pump loop tests the most severe attack of metal sur-
faces 1s noted concurrently with the most rapid degradation in the size of
the slurry particles [104].

IFor all metals of interest, except the most noble, the destruction of a
protective oxide film exposes reactive metal to the aqueous medium. The
rate of reaction is very high, and the rate of film re-formation will control
this reaction rate and the net amount of metal consumed. Changes in the
chemical environment and pH via gaseous atmosphere, additives, or 1n-
growing corrosion or fission products will strongly affect the rate of metal
reaction and oxide re-formation.

Methods of test. The relative abrasiveness of slurries may be determined
in a laboratory jet-impingement test device developed by McBride [105]
in which a slurry spray is jetted against a thin metal strip and penetration
time noted.

To obtain accurate slurry corrosion data, toroids, pump loops, and in-
pile autoclaves have been used for high-temperature tests with aqueous
slurries. This equipment is described in Section 5-2.

In toroid tests, information is obtained as to corrosion rate of several
metals, slurry particle degradation, and qualitative slurry handling charac-
teristics by examination of metal pin specimens and analysis of the with-
drawn slurry.

In pump loops, a larger amount of quantitative information is obtained
at several different velocities and flow patterns from an examination of
loop components, as well as specimens. Generalized incremental loop cor-
rosion rates and slurry properties are obtained at suitable intervals from
analysis of withdrawn samples.

By use of rocking in-pile autoclaves, tests at negligible flow velocities
have been made at neutron fluxes approaching 10" to evaluate corrosion
rates and rates of production and recombination of radiolytic gas.

5-7.2 Slurry materials. Uranium dioxide. Uranium-dioxide slurry and
quartz slurries were tested in small-scale loops and spinning cylinder sys-
tems in the early days of the Manhattan Project. It was observed [106-
107] that erosion was proportional to the square or cube of the velocity,
varied strongly with particle size, decreased with time as particle size
degradation took place, and exhibited a constant ratio for different ma-
terials under the same conditions. Uranium dioxide has a Moh scale hard-
ness of 6.1 [108] and to a certain extent would be expected to resemble
thoria under a hydrogen atmosphere, as described later,

Uranium irioxide. The attack of stainless steel pump-loop components
by uranium trioxide slurries at 250°C was essentially nil in tests extended
for thousands of hours, even on pump impellers with a tip velocity of
120 fps [109]. The lack of attack by circulating uranium trioxide slurries
under conditions in which impingement certainly occurred is attributed
to the relative softness of the uranium trioxide particles.

Thorium oxide. The major portion of studies on corrosion-erosion
characteristics of high-temperature aqueous slurries has been carried out
using thorium oxide [110-111]. Most preparations have used the calcina-
tion product of thorium oxalate precipitated under various conditions,
with calcination temperatures from 430 to 1600°C having been used.
Thoria prepared by other procedures, such as formate precipitation, has
also been examined. Thoria calcined at temperatures in the vicinity of
1600°C has low surface area, crystallite sizes approaching particle size, less
tendency to degrade, and exhibits a greater tendency to produce abrasive
sintered particles; consequently, certain of such thoria products have been

Thoria calcined at 650 to 900°C because of its properties was considerably
degraded by continued pumping and was reported [112] to show greatly
reduced corrosion rates as this occurred.
The hardness of thoria minerals has been reported as 6.5 on the Moh
scale. The hardness of thoria densified with 0.59, CaO is 6.8 [113], and
laboratory preparations of thoria have been observed with hardness greater
than 7. The hardness of many mineral oxides, of a composition similar to
the protective film on metals, lies between 6 and 6.5. However, sapphire
attacked by high-temperature aqueous thoria slurry has a hardness of 9.

mens of various materials were exposed for 1000 hr to a slurry of 1500 g
Th/kg Ho0 at 280°C in a pump loop pressurized with steam plus
200 psi O02. The 1600°C-caleined thoria had an average particle size of
1.7 microns, with 39, of the particles greater than 3 microns, and the
slurry had a pH of 5.8 measured at 25°C. The results of the test are sum-
marized in Table 5-11.

5-7.3 Effect of slurry characteristics. Particle size. Two effects relating
to particle size have been distinguished. These are the effects of largeness
of particles and of particle degradation. Large particles cause erosion-
corrosion. This is In agreement with the impingement model of slurry
attack. Tables 5-12 and 5-13 show comparisons of pump-loop corrosion
tests in which, in the respective tables, the larger-particle-size slurry shows
more aggressive attack.
5-7] AQUEOUS SLURRY CORROSION 257

The removal of large sintered particles resulted in a substantial reduc-
tion in corrosion rate for all materials in the tests shown in Table 5-12,
This effect for thoria produced by high-temperature calcination was suf-
ficient to justify including similar classification in the regular production
procedure. Particles of large crystallite size (>0.25 micron) from which
the sintered particles had been removed by classification were shown to
produce comparatively low corrosion rates. Particles composed of large
crystallites are not much degraded by continued circulation, and conse-
quently corrosion rates do not diminish much with time.

Low-crystallite-size materials (calcined at relatively low temperatures,
e.g., 800°C) become degraded as circulation proceeds, and aggressiveness
is diminished. Thus, a shorter test showed a higher rate of corrosion, and
a test using previously pumped material showed a lower rate of attack.
This, and the change of particle size with time, is illustrated in Table 5-13.

Effect of calcination temperature. The major effect of increased caleina-
tion temperature is to cause growth of larger crystallites, and under ad-
verse circumstances, sintered particles. Sintered particles, of course, would
cause increased attack. However, unless sintering occurred, particles have
not appeared to increase in size on calcination. At constant particle size,
calcination temperature has not exhibited a direct effect on corrosion
rate. Indirectly, lower calcination temperatures result in lower crystallite
sizes and particles may be more readily degraded to smaller, less erosive
sizes. Table 5-14 illustrates these points [114]. Except for the unac-
countably increased attack by material calcined at 800°C, there appears
to be no general effect of calcination temperature on attack rates in these
short-term tests. It Is also noted that the material calcined at higher tem-
peratures is less degraded. In longer tests this would be expected to result
in maintaining the original corrosion rate, rather than resulting in a de-
crease in rate when the particle size becomes smaller,

As crystallite size becomes larger, surface area is reduced. This reduces
the adsorptive capacity of the thoria and thus influences the action of addi-
tives on corrosion. ITandling properties are also changed.

Effect of concentration. In general, corrosion-erosion by slurries has been
observed to increase with concentration [115-116}, and roughly is indi-
cated to be directly proportional to concentration, in concentration ranges
of reactor interest. As concentration is increased, the effect of rheological
properties on flow characteristics becomes more pronounced, and the effect
on corrosion would become altered.

Effect of atmosphere. It is possible to distinguish between the effects of
different atmospheres resulting from high oxygen concentration, low oxy-
gen concentration, dissolved hydrogen, or other dissolved gases.

High oxygen concentration [117-119] in pump loop and toroid tests has
appeared to result in less aggressive attack on type-347 stainless steel than

tests which used no added oxygen. Oxygen concentrations of 250 ppm
(160 ce/kg H20) appear sufficient to protect stainless steel. Toroid tests
[120] in which the oxygen was consumed resulted in more aggressive
attack of this metal. Corrosion products were black rather than tan-brown
in color and were found to contain Fes04. In systems having hydrogen
5-7] AQUEQUS SLURRY CORROSION 259

atmosphere, stainless steel was attacked somewhat (perhaps threefold)
more aggressively than in the presence of sufficient oxygen.

These data are presumably valid also for ferritic and martensitic stain-
less steels.

The corrosion resistance of carbon steel is improved under hydrogen
atmosphere. Rates in some cases have approached those observed for
stainless steels in the same experiment. Less localized attack is noted
under hydrogen atmosphere.

Titanium appears to be equally corrosion resistant in oxygenated and
hydrogenated systems, provided the slurry is not strongly alkaline. At
150°C titanium is more readily abraded by slurry with hydrogen atmos-
phere. In alkaline systems with hydrogen atmosphere, a very aggressive
attack has been noted, as would be anticipated from the interpretation of
Schmets and Pourbaix [121].

Zirconium alloys appear to be little affected by atmosphere. They are
possibly more easily abraded under hydrogen atmosphere.

Nickel alloys and also Stellites appear, in agreement with Douglas [122],
to be substantially more corrosion resistant under hydrogen atmosphere,
and several nickel alloys have appeared to be more resistant than stainless
steel when exposed with it in experiments under hydrogen atmosphere.

The nature of the atmosphere also affects the oxidation state and solu-
bility of certain corrosion products and through these may affect the
properties of the slurry. Under an oxygen atmosphere iron exists as FeO,
and chromium as soluble, acidic CrOz. Under hydrogen atmosphere, iron
is in the form of I'e30y4, and chromium is insoluble Cra),

Effect of additives. Additives include the unavoidable corrosion products
and fission products; the necessary, or difficultly avoidable, recombination
ratalysts; uranium inclusions in the particle and certain impurities; and
optional materials added to modify the properties of the slurry.

Corrosion products have not been observed to affect the course of cor-
rosion in oxygenated systems, although they have built up to levels of a
few grams per liter in certain lengthy tests. Soluble chromic acid may
affect the corrosion rate of such material as carbon steel. No experimental
results are available on the effect of fission products.

Molybdenum oxide (a potential recombination catalyst) has shown a
mild corrosion-inhibiting action. Uranium inclusions in the thoria have not
been found to increase corrosion rates. Certain impurities, 1.e., carbonate
and sulfate carried through the production process, have not been found to
affect corrosion rates except when added in large quantity, as described
below. Chloride, which can cause stress-corroston cracking of stainless
steel, 1s undesirable in any quantity, as is fluoride.

Certain materials have been found to impart desirable handling proper-
ties to slurries at lower temperatures and have been of interest to test at
260) INTEGRITY OF METALS IN HOMOGENEOUS REACTORS [cHAP. 5

higher temperatures (e.g., 280°C). These have included sulfates (thorium,
sodium, caleium, hydrogen), phosphates (sodium monobasic, dibasic,
tribasic, pyro-), silicates (sodium meta- and more acid compositions), and
fluorides (thorium). In general it has been found that additives imparting
acidity [e.g., 11.804, Th(S04)s] tend to attack ferrous-based materials,
especially under low oxygen or reducing atmosphere. There is less effect
of moderate concentrations with oxygen atmospheres, Alkaline materials
tend to increase attack of titanium under reducing atmosphere and to
affect the performance of other metals. Complexing or reacting additives
(e.g., alkaline phosphate with titanium, fluorides with zirconium) tend to
destroy protective films and thereby merease attack rates.

All soluble ionic additives appear initially to be adsorbed on the thoria
surface. Their effect on corrosion is much greater after surface capacity is
exceeded. Surface capacity varies with different thoria preparations, pri-
marily with surface area.

5-7.4 Effect of operation conditions. Flow velocity is a very important
factor in corrosion by slurries. Corrosion rate appears te be approximately
proportional to the square of velocity at moderate velocities and possibly
to a somewhat higher power at higher velocities. The effect of velocity is
shown in Table 5-14 and in Table 5-15.

In addition to increasing regularly with velocity, greater attack in
entrance regions and at the highest velocities was noted. The more severe
attack on cylindrical pins is attributed to greater turbulence effects for
this shape.

Velocity effects are also shown on the pump impeller in Fig. 5-20.
Velocity increased radially from the hub, and attack was most severe at
the rim. However, the vanes and inner shroud surface were polished,
which indicates the importance of boundary-layer considerations in the
study of such effects.

Cavitation also may be an important factor in the high-velocity attack.
Attack on pump impellers has been found to be more severe in experiments
in which gas bubbles were believed to have been entrained in the slurry.
Erosion patterns similar to those observed by Shalnev [123] have been
found on pin-specimen-holder channel walls, with most severe points of
attack a few pin diameters downstream from a pin. Although this agrees
with Shalnev’s observations, it is not clear whether the effect is due to
cavitation or simply high eddy density at this point.

Shape effects. The importance of shape effects in corrosion by flowing
slurries may be very great, and the most severe attack has been observed
to be a result of eddy erosion-corrosion associated with shape effects. The
attack in some cases has appeared to be self-accelerating as pits develop.
The importance of shape effects will depend strongly on velocity and also
on particle characteristics and chemical environment.

Design considerations are quite important. Streamlining of all sensitive
parts and regions sheuld be practiced to the maximum extent possible, in
order to avoid impingement or wake effects. Surface irregularities such as
rough finish, erevices, or protrusions should be avoided. The interior de-
sign of flow channels should be carefully considered in order to avoid im-
pingement, flow separation, and wakes insofar as possible. Conditions con-
ducive to cavitation should be avoided, since vigorous attack would be
anticipated under such conditions.

Temperature. In general, temperature effects are associated with the
reaction between water and the metal. Those materials most sensitive to
water corrosion (e.g., Stellites in oxygenated aqueous systems) exhibit
stronger temperature effects.

For many materials, corrosion rate has appeared to double for every
30 to 60°C increase in temperature.

Time. Changes in attack rate with time generally are not observed after
the slurry has reached its equilibrium condition. Until this condition is
reached, the slurry particle size may be larger than its degradation mini-
mum. Consequently, more aggressive attack is usually observed in the
early exposure period.
262 INTEGRITY OF METALS IN IHHOMOGENEOUS REACTORS [cHAP, 5

Localized attack which created eddy erosion pits could become more
rapid as these pits developed.

Carbon steel has appeared in oxygenated systems to form its protective
film rather slowly. Diminishing attack rates were observed over a period
of at least 700 hr.

5-7.5 Radiation. Awloclave tests. Data are available [124] on the at-
tack of Zirealoy-2 under radiation by thoria slurries in gently agitated
autoclaves. No radiation data are available under flow conditions. Com-
parison of unirradiated control experiments with tests conducted in a re-
actor radiation field having a slow-neutron flux of 0.5 to 1.0 X 103 have
indicated that both experiments had an initial rate of approximately 1 mpy
with thoria slurries in D20 at 280°C (oxygenated). However, no reduction
in rate with time was noted under radiation, while the rate decreased sig-
nificantly with time in a longer unirradiated control. Similar results were
obtained on pure D20O under radiation. Inclusion of enriched uranium in
a thoria preparation permitted an experiment in which a fission power
density of 0.5 to 1 watt/ml was achieved. Only a slight increase in rate,
several tenths of a mill per year, was noted as a result under these con-
ditions.

If radiation affects the protective oxide film, it is likely that more severe
effects will be observed in the presence of radiation with slurry under
sufficiently vigorous flow conditions.

5-8. HoMocENEOUS REACTOR METALLURGY®

5-8.1 Introduction. Although many other materials are used for special
applications in homogeneous reactors, in the following section only zirco-
nium, titanium, austenitic stainless steels, and pressure-vessel steel are
considered.

Zircaloy-2 (1.5% Sn, 0.1% Fe, 0.19% Cr, 0.0059 Ni) used in the present
reactors is the only commercially available zirconium alloy. It is a single-
phase alloy with moderately good mechanical properties, is not heat
treatable, and is stable under operating conditions.

Of the possible types of titanium and its alloys commercially available
in the United States, only unalloyed titanium and one alpha alloy
A-110AT (5.0% Al, 2.59% Sn) are satisfactory for homogeneous reactor
applications. Beta alloys are not yet available and alpha-beta alloys, often
structurally unstable under high stress and high temperature, cannot be
welded without subsequent heat treatment. Although A-110AT has high
strength and is stable and weldable, it is unavailable as pipe or tubing and

is difficult to fabricate. For such applications, so called “unalloyed”
titanium (A—40 and A-55) is used. These high-purity grades are readily
weldable in contrast to the stronger grades, are stable, and are available
in all forms. Their disadvantage 1s their low strength at elevated tempera-
tures which, except as linings, makes their use for large high-pressure,
high-temperature equipment doubtful. Extensive use of titanium for
homogeneous reactor use will probably depend upon the eventual develop-
ment of a fabricable high-strength alpha alloy.

The pressure vessel for HRE-2 is constructed of A-212 grade B steel
clad with 347 stainless steel. The serious possibility of radiation damage is
the most important metallurgical limitation of this material. This problem
1s discussed in Article 5-8.8.

5-8.2 Fabrication and morphology of Zircaloy-2. When work was started
on the HRE-2 core tank, very little was known about the physical metal-
lurgy and fabrication of zirconium alloys. A procedure was available for the
fabrication of zirconium fuel elements, but the variables of fabrication had
not been investigated in detail. Since this core tank was a vital portion of
the reactor system and was needed early in order to proceed with the
pressure-vessel fabrication, 1t was built to a time schedule that permitted
only a limited amount of development work. As a result, much of the
present-day understanding of the physical metallurgy of Zircaloy-2 was
not obtained in time to be used. During the development work for the tank,
many variations were found in the available Zircaloy-2 plate. These
included variations in mechanical properties, in bend radii, and in the
amount of laminations and stringers.

Fabrication practice for the core-tank plate was based upon procedures
developed by Westinghouse Atomic Power Division [125], but modified
by increased cross-rolling to reduce the preferred orientation. The fabrica-
tion procedure for the core tank* is discussed in detail in Refs. 126 and 127.

This procedure resulted in the fine-grained, equiaxed, but oriented struc-
ture shown by the anodized sample [128] in Fig. 5-21. Two disadvantages
of this material were the stringers found in the structure and the preferred
orientation as shown by uneven extinction in rotation in polarized light.

Since it was suspected that the stringers were responsible for some of
the variation in mechanical properties, they were examined in considerable
detail in the morphological study. The two types of stringers prevalent in
Zircaloy—2 are an intermetallic stringer, usually found in the alpha grain

boundaries, as shown in Fig. 5-21, and an elongated void within the grains,
caused by trapped gases. The latter type was found rarely in HRE-2 core-
tank metal, but a small one may be noted in the photomicrograph of the
developed material. This type may be largely eliminated by vacuum
melting of the original ingots. It has been determined that the intermetallic
stringers were formed during fabrication. While the upper fabrication
temperature of 850°C was thought to have been in the all-alpha region,
this is now known to be in error. The correct temperature for the alpha
to alpha-plus-beta transition is 810°C and that for the beta to beta-plus-
alpha transition 1s 970°C [129]. These temperatures will vary slightly with
ingot composition. Holding at a temperature just above the lower boundary
of the two-phase region resulted in the presence of small amounts of beta in
the grain corners. By quenching samples held at 840°C, it was shown that
approximately 159, of the material had been beta phase at that tem-
perature and that the beta phase had been present in the grain corners.
Iron, nickel, and chromium are beta stabilizers and will partition to the
beta phase, which will be strung out during rolling. On cooling, the beta
phase decomposes, precipitating the alpha zirconium on the neighboring
grains and leaving the intermetallics in the grain boundaries. These inter-
metallic stringers will dissolve on reheating to 1000°C while the stringers
formed by the trapped gases will not.

While mechanical property tests of the core-tank material (see Article
5-8.3) indicated uniform properties in the longitudinal and transverse
directions, it was noted that the fractures were not round but were oval,

indicating anisotropic properties. This was confirmed by a polarized-light
examination. The actual orientation of the material was determined using
a special x-ray diffraction technique [130], with the data being reported in
the form of inverse pole figures [131] shown in Fig. 5-22. Since variations
were found in the intensity of the pole concentrations, it is evident that
the core-tank plate had preferred orientation in all three directions.
Quantitative calculations indicated that the plate had adequate ductility
266 INTEGRITY OF METALS IN HOMOGENEOUS REACTORS [cHAP. 5

and nearly isotropic properties in the rolling plane but very little ductility
in the normal direction to the plate, since in this direction few deformation
systems were available for slip or twinning.

To improve the quality of Zircaloy-2 and to predict what structures
would be encountered in weldments, a study of the effect of heat treatment
and fabrication practice was initiated. Representative photomicrographs
of structures resulting from these studies are presented in Fig. 5-23. The
fine “'basket-weave” alpha structure observed in beta-quenched samples
appeared to offer the most likely starting point. Reerystallization of this
structure by annealing at temperatures between 700 and 800°C resulted
in the formation of very large alpha grains, without stringers or inter-
metallic precipitates. Cold-working of the “basket-weave’’ structure, 15%
or less before annealing, also resulted in the production of large grains;
however, if the amount of cold-working exceeded 209, improvement in the
form of fine grains (ASTM 6 to 8) with a more nearly random structure
resulted.

Scrap from the core-tank plate was heat treated by beta quenching, cold-
worked 20%, and alpha annealed. The diffraction results after this treat-
ment are also shown on the diagrams in Fig. 5-22. The intensity of the
peaks has been decreased by a factor of two and the peaks shifted 20 deg
from the original position. These changes indicate an increase in duc-
tility in the normal direction.

The results of the morphological study were used to outline an improved
fabrication schedule for Zircaloy-2 [132]. This schedule* has been used
successfully by commercial fabricators while more complete fabrication
studies are being made. The material obtained from this procedure has a
microstructure such as that shown in Fig. 5-21. It is essentially free of
stringers, contains little or no intermetallic precipitate, and has small
equiaxed grains with essentially a random orientation as seen under polar-
ized light.

5-8.3 Mechanical properties of zirconium and titanium. The use of
titanium and zirconium for pressure-containing equipment is complicated
by the fact that both metals are hexagonal, rather than cubic, making
preferred orientation a severe problem. The larger variations of mechanical
properties with crystal orientation make it difficult to achieve the uni-
formity in all directions which is desirable in a pressure vessel. In addition,
the determination of the mechanical properties of hexagonal metals, using
standard tests developed for cubic metals, is questionable because the suita-

fracture and the ratio between them. In isotropic material the percentage
reduction would be the same in both directions and the ratio would there-
fore be one. As shown, some reduction in anisotropy was obtained by the
use of the developed procedure described previously.

Anisotropy of these materials may also be shown by V-notch Charpy
impact tests. Since size effects are known to be critical in this type test,
standard size specimens were used, thereby eliminating the thin core tank
plate. Charpy V impact energy curves obtained with specimens and notches
cut from various orientations from commercial plate and from a plate
fabricated by the developed procedure are shown in Fig, 5-24 [133].
Differences in both the energy values and transition temperatures are
apparent for the various orientations. These differences are reduced by the
developed fabrication procedure.

With Zircaloy-2 the fracture appearance of the impact samples was not
obviously indicative of the properties, as with steels. Shear lips, which are
normally a mark of a ductile fracture, were found on samples from some
orientations regardless of breaking temperature, but on specimens from
other orientations from the same plate, shear lips were not found at any
temperature.

The effects of notches and cracks in zirconium were studied using the
drop-weight test as developed for steels by Pellini and others [134] at the
Naval Research Laboratories. This test determines the highest tempera-
ture at which a crack will propagate through a specimen undergoing limited
deformation. For steels this temperature is distinct and reproducible and
has been labeled the NDT (nil ductility transition) temperature. Com-
mercial Zircaloy—2 showed surprisingly good properties from this test.
The NDT temperature was —160°C for the longitudinal direction and be-
tween —100 and —150°C for the transverse direction. However, contrary
to the definition, when the fracture faces were examined, shear lips were
found even at very low temperatures. The NDT temperature was well
below the lower break in the Charpy V impact curve on the flat portion
of the curve.

Titanium. Data available from manufacturers on the mechanical prop-
erties of titanium are generally adequate for present limited uses.

The NDT temperature for A-55 titanium was measured at ORNL on
several plates and found to be below —200°C. Incomplete fractures were
found at this temperature for both longitudinal and transverse specimens.

As a portion of the brittle fracture study a plate of A-70 titanium con-
taining 400 ppm of hydrogen was tested. The results from this plate gave
impact curves that were not affected by orientation and had a sharp
break similar to steels. The NDT temperature for this brittle plate was
100°C and was located at the lower break of the impact curve. With this

in the alloy.

Irradiated metals. In spite of the many questions that have been raised
about the adequacy of mechanical property tests for hexagonal metals, the
difficulties of which are magnified in testing irradiated samples, some me-
chanical property tests of irradiated samples have been attempted. Subsize
tensile and impact specimens of Zircaloy-2, erystal-bar zirconium, and
A—40 titanium have been irradiated in fissioning uranyl-sulfate solution,
in in-pile corrosion loops, at temperatures of 250 to 280°C, to total fast
fluxes (>1 Mev) of up to 3 X 10" nvt for zirconium and 10 for titanium
[133]. Zirconium appears to be resistant to radiation damage under these
conditions. The only changes noted have been small changes in yield point.
Titanium seems to undergo some embrittlement. The tensile and yield
strengths for titanium increased while the reduction in area decreased. The

changes were by about 109, of the unirradiated values.

5-8.4 Welding of titanium and zirconium. The welding of titanium and
zirconium and their alloys 1s complicated by the fact that at elevated
temperatures they will react to form brittle alloys with oxygen, nitrogen,
hydrogen, water vapor, and carbon dioxide. Successful welding 1s, therefore,
dependent upon protecting the molten metal and adjacent area from all
contaminants. Prior to the construction of the HRE-2 core tank, the only
method used for welding zirconium was fusion welding, with the necessary
protection achieved by conducting the operations inside inert-atmosphere
boxes [135]. The use of 5/16- and 3/8-in. plate for the HRE-2 core required

the development of multipass welding techniques, while the large size of
the vessel made the use of atmosphere boxes impractical.

In a joint effort, the Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company
and Oak Ridge National Laboratory developed a machine for multipass
welding of Zircaloy—2 in which the face protection was achieved by the use
of trailers attached to the torch [127]. Root protection was achieved either
by special backup devices or, where possible, by purging closed systems.
In this device, a standard Heliarc torch was mounted on a small metal box,
or trailer, Fig. 5-25. Both the method of supporting the trailer and its
shape were varied with the configuration of the part being welded. The
underside of the trailer was open and the lower edges of the sides were con-
toured to closely match the shape of the part being welded. Inert gas was
distributed through the box by internal copper tubes along both sides.
For all these welds, the torch and trailer were held fixed by a device which
positioned the torch and spring loaded it against the work. The work
pieces were moved under the torch, which remained fixed in a vertical posi-
tion. The welding, with all the necessary adjustments and controls, re-
quired two operators.

The joint configuration of a typical Zircaloy-2 weld is shown in Fig. 5-26.
All root passes were made using the preplaced insert which had been
machined from swaged Zircaloy—-2 wire. The inserts were tacked into place
with a hand torch before the machine welding was started. The first filler
metal pass was made with either 3/32- or 1/8-in. wire and all others with
1/8-in. Careful wire brushing with a stainless steel brush was required after
every pass. Welding details for a typical joint are tabulated in Table
5-17; detailed procedures are given in Ref. 27.

In both this work and that which subsequently developed out of 1t, one
of the major problems has been to determine the quality of the weld. Welds
were examined visually, with liquid penetrants, and usually with radiog-
raphy; however, none of these provided information about the degree of
contamination. Measurement of the average microhardness of a prepared
sample has proved to be an acceptable and sensitive indication of contami-
nation. While this is a destructive test, it has been adopted as a standard
test for this work. In the actual production welding, reliance had to be
placed upon the strict adherence to procedures previously shown to be
satisfactory by the destructive tests. Average hardnesses of over 500 DPH
(diamond pyramid hardness) are found in lightly contaminated welds
and increase to approximately a thousand diamond pyramid hardness
numbers in contaminated metal. With this welding procedure average
hardnesses of less than 200 DPH were consistently obtained. The absence
of contamination was confirmed by vacuum fusion analyses of weld sections.

Although this welding procedure was slow and awkward, it was used
successfully for the fabrication of the HRE-2 core tank. Many satis-

factory multipass welds were completed in the assembly of the Zircaloy—2
tank.

Construction of a titanium circulating system for a homogeneous reactor
requires many welds of all sizes, some of which must be made in place.
While the procedure discussed above for zirconium can also be used for
titanium, it is impractical for field welding of equipment and piping of
varying sizes and shapes.

It has been found possible to make acceptable weldments in unalloyed
titanium using only conventional tungsten, inert gas, arc-welding equip-
ment [136]. By welding an A-55 base plate (average hardness of about
160 DPH for the annealed plate) with a filler rod of A-40, it is possible to
consistently obtain welds with average hardnesses of less than 190 DPH
(10 kg) for plates 1/4-in. and less in thickness. Hardnesses of less than
220 DPH are achieved for heavier plates requiring more passes. On the
basis of tensile and bend tests, a hardness as high as 240 DPH would be
acceptable.

The recommended conditions and configuration for a typical titanium
weldment are shown in Fig. 5-26 and Table 5-17. A comparison of the
recommended joint design and welding conditions for air welding of ti-
tanium with those used for trailer welding of Zircaloy-2 or for welding of
5-8] HOMOGENEOUS REACTOR METALLURGY 275

austenitic stainless steels shows an obvious trend to lower heat inputs and
the use of small molten pools. The reduced size and temperature of the
pool minimizes the possibilities of contamination during welding and also
permits more rapid cooling after the weld is completed. These changes
reduce the welding speed and thereby make this a precision welding method
rather than a high-speed production procedure. Details of the procedure,
including a comparison with welds made in atmosphere boxes, a discussion
of adequate inert gas coverage, and the use of surface discoloration as an
inspection method, are given in Ref. 136. In an effort to simplify and make
more versatile the procedures used for welding Zircaloy—2 an attempt was
made to adopt the inert gas procedures successfully developed for titanium.
Under similar conditions it was, however, found to be more difficult to
prevent contamination in Zircaloy—2 than it had been with titanium. Where
multipass welds in titanium had resulted in hardness increases of 20 to 30
DPH numbers, similar welds in Zircaloy—-2 increased by 50 to 100 numbers.
It was also necessary to increase the radius used on the bend tests of the
weldments from twice the plate thickness with titanium to four times the
thickness with Zircaloy, primarily because of the lower ductility of the
base metal. While multipass welds of this quality would be acceptable for
many applications, additional improvement will be necessary to make them
generally acceptable.

5-8.5 Combustion of zirconium and titanium. After several equipment
failures in which evidences of melted titanium were found under operating
temperatures not exceeding 250°C, a study of the ignition and combustion
of titanium and zirconium was started. This work has been done by Stan-
ford Research Institute under the direction of E. M. Kinderman [137].

Two types of tests were developed for studying the ignition reactions;
in one, a thin metal disk was fractured either by gas pressure or by a
plunger, while in the other, either a thin sheet or a 1/4-in. rod was broken
in a tensile manner. In either test, both the composition and pressure of the
atmosphere could be varied. With both types of tests, it proved to be
surprisingly easy to initiate combustion of titanium. Ignition and complete
consumption of both disks and rods occurred when titanium was ruptured,
even at room temperature, in a high pressure of pure oxygen.

The limiting conditions for the ignition of A-55 titanium varied with
the total pressure, the percentage of oxygen and the gas velocity. Under
dynamic conditions in pure oxygen, ignition occurred at total pressures as
low as 50 psi but with 509 oxygen the total pressure required was 700 psi
with the reaction curve becoming asymptotic with the pressure axis at
about 35% oxygen, showing no ignition would occur at any total pressure
with this or lower oxygen concentrations. The corresponding values for
static systems are 350 psi (100% O32), 1900 psi (50% O32), and 45% oxygen
276 INTEGRITY OF METALS IN HOMOGENEOUS REACTORS [cHAP. 5

(no ignition at any pressure). Similar results were obtained whether the
oxygen was diluted with steam or with helium. In no case was a reaction
noted when samples were fractured under oxygenated water.

As might be expected, lower critical oxygen pressures were required for
the propagation of the combustion than for the ignition. If the molten
spot was formed by an external means, propagation and consumption of the
entire sample occurred with about 209% oxygen.

Because of the autoignition of titanium, various metals and alloys such
as stainless steel, aluminum, magnesium, iron, tantalum, columbium,
molybdenum, Zircaloy-2, and alloys of titanium were tested with oxygen
pressures up to 2000 psi. Only the titanium alloys and Zircaloy-2 reacted.
Within the limits of accuracy of these studies (£50 psi) no differences were
found in the behavior of the various titanium alloys.

While zirconium is similar to titanium in that autoignition can occur,
the critical oxygen pressures appear to be considerably higher. Whereas,
under dynamic conditions, titanium ignited with 50 psi oxygen, a zirconium
disk required 500 psi. Under static conditions a 0.015-in. thick strip of
titanium ignited at a pressure of 350 psi but a similar strip of zirconium
required 750 psi. A 1/4-in. titanium rod ignited under the same conditions
as the strip, but a zirconium rod did not ignite at 1500 psi oxygen.

5-8.6 Development of new zirconium alloys. An alloy development
program was started at ORNL to find a radiation-corrosion-resistant
zirconium-base alloy with satisfactory metallurgical properties. These
include weldability, strength, ductility, formability and stability.

A wide variety of binary zirconium alloys was exposed in autoclaves
and in in-pile loops to uranyl-sulfate solutions (see Section 5-5); however,
only alloys of zirconium with niobium, palladium, or platinum showed
greater corrosion resistance than Zircaloy—2. With the exception of the
phase diagrams and a few mechanical property tests on low-niobium al-
loys [138], no information on any of these systems was available in the
open literature. The few results for the mechanical property tests indicated
very brittle alloys.

Two phase diagrams for the zirconium-niobium system are in the litera-
ture [139,140]. A cursory check of the diagram by determining the eutec-
toid temperature and approximate composition confirmed the first of these
[139]. A few preliminary transformation specimens, with near-eutectoid
compositions, revealed complicated and embrittling transformation struc-
tures. Since the zirconium-niobium alloy system showed promise from a
corrosion viewpoint, these alloys with niobium contents varying from 2 to
33 w/o and many ternary alloys with small additions to the Zr-15Nb
base were studied with the objective of eliminating the undesirable prop-
erties. Information obtained includes the transformation kinetics and
5-8] HOMOGENEQUS REACTOR METALLURGY 277

products, morphologies, in-pile corrosion resistance, fabrication techniques,
metallographic procedures, and some mechanical properties [141]. At
least three transformation reactions occur in the zirconium-niobium binary
system. The transformation sequence is quite complex, with the only
straightforward transformation being a eutectoidal transformation oc-
curring close to the eutectoid temperature. The most troublesome trans-
formation is the formation of an omega phase which occurs in beta-quenched
and reheated samples. Time-temperature-hardness studies for material
heat treated in this manner showed very high hardnesses in short times
with low temperature aging treatments. Aging times of three weeks did
not result in over-aging and softening of such material. This transformation
would make multipass welding of this material very difficult.

Because of the hardness and slow transformations of the binary zirco-
nium-niobium alloys, ternary additions to the Zr-15Nb base of up to
Dw, 0 Mo, Pd, and Pt, up to 29; Fe, Ni, Cr, Al, Ag, V, Ta, and Th and
0.5% Cu have been studied. In general, the primary effects of the addition
of small amounts of the ternary substitutional alloying elements are the
lowering of the maximum temperature at which the hardening reaction
can oceur, an increase in incubation time for the beginning of the hardening
reactions, a lowering of the temperature for the most rapid rate of harden-
ing, and an increase in rate for the higher-temperature conventional
hypoeutectoid reaction [142]. Of the ternary additions, Ie, Ni, and Cr
have the least effect, Pt and Pd an intermediate effect, and Mo the largest.
The additions of Cu and Al drastically reduced the maximum temperature
at which the hardening transformation took place and reduced the
temperature at which the hardening transformation took place at the
maximum rate, but did not increase the incubation period for the reaction
sufficiently to prevent excessive hardening in the heat-affected zone of a
weldment. The addition of 5 w/o Ta to the Zr-15Nb base alloy resulted
in the formation of a completely martensitic structure on quenching from
the beta {icld, and the addition of oxygen by the use of sponge Zr resulted
in an Increase lu the rate of all transformations. The addition of 297 Pd or
Pt to Zr-15Nb delays the hardening sufliciently to make welding possible;
however, it would be necessary to follow it by a stabilizing heat treatment.

Cursory fabrication studies have been performed during the course of
the alloy development program in the preparation of sheet specimens for
studies of the transformation kinetics [143]. All the Zr-Nb-X alloys have
heen hot-rolled from 800°C quite successfully, A sponge-base Zr-15Nb arc
casting has been successfully extruded at 950°C to form rods. While the
fabrication techniques developed are adequate for the production of speci-
men material, they are not necessarily optimum for the commercial pro-
duction of plate, sheet, bar, rod, and wire in these alloys.

An ultimate tensile strength of Zr-15Nb at room temperature of 200,000
278 INTEGRITY OF METALS IN HOMOGENEOUS REACTORS {cHAP. 5

psi, with no elongation was obtained on specimens beta-quenched and
aged at 400°C for 2 hr. Similar specimens aged at 500°C for 2 weeks and
measured at room temperature had an ultimate strength of 150,000 psi,
a yield strength of 135,000 psi, and an elongation of 109. At 300°C this
material had an ultimate strength of 105,000 psi, a yield of 90,000 psi,
and an elongation of 16% in one inch.

While the Zr-153Nb base ternary alloys are still of interest primarily
for their potential improvement in corrosion resistance, they show promise
of a wider, general use as structural material. These are the first zirconium
alloys that may be heat-treated to high strength and yet are weldable and
tabricable.

5-8.7 Inspection of metals by nondestructive testing methods. Of the
several methods of nondestructive inspection, a visual examination, aided
by contrast dye or fluorescent penetrant, can be used to detect very fine sur-
face cracks or other surface flaws [144]. Radiography with penetrating
radiation is used, especially for weldments, to inspect the interior of
materials [145]. Such tests are limited in that unfavorably oriented eracks
and laminations are very difficult to detect and the methods are slow and
expensive. Ultrasonic methods are not subject to the same limitations as
radiography. Defects which are oriented unfavorably for radiography are
often readily detected by pulse-echo ultrasonie inspection.

An immersed, pulse-echo, ultrasonic technique developed in the Non-
destructive Test Development Laboratory for inspecting tubular products
[146] utilizes water as a coupling medium for the ultrasound. A very short
pulse of 5-megacycle ultrasonic energy is directed through the water and
into the wall of the tube under inspection. The tube is rotated while the
source of the ultrasound, a lithium-sulfate transducer, is moved along the
tube. The angle at which the sound is incident upon the tube wall 1s care-
fully adjusted, and echoes from defects are amplified and processed with
commercial cquipment. This instrumentation includes an “A scan,”
which is a cathode-ray tube presentation of echo amplitude on a horizontal
time base, and a “B scan” which presents time on the vertical sweep, the
horizontal sweep representing the rotation of the tubing being inspected,
and the echo amplitude being indicated by brilliance. The “B scan”
presentation is used as a visual aid in the interpretation of the ultrasonic
reflections. These echoes are compared with the echoes from internal and
external notches of known depth in identical tubing in order to estimate
the depth of the flaw which causes the echo.

A remote ultrasonic technique is used to monitor the thickness of the
HRE-2 core vessel without the necessity for access to both sides of the
vessel wall. The method consists of introducing a swept-frequency beam
of ultrasound into the wall of the vessel, which is thereby induced into
5-8] HOMOGENEOUS REACTOR METALLURGY 279

vibration at its resonant frequency and harmonics thereof. The resonances
are sensed by the exciting transducer, and the signals from the resonances
are amplified, processed, and displayed on a cathode-ray tube. In most
cases layers of corrosion products inside the vessel are not included in the
thickness measured and, therefore, the measurement represents the thick-
ness of sound, uncorroded metal. However, a slight increase (3 to 6 mils) has
been noted in the tank thickness since it was installed and the reactor
operated. It is not known whether this is due to experimental inaccuracies,
to changes in the metal, or to the presence of scale.

Simple shapes such as small-diameter tubing can be tested very rapidly
by eddy-current methods. Such methods have been developed and used
at ORNL to identify and sort various metals, to determine the thickness
of clad or plated layers, to make rapid dimensional measurements of tubing,
and to detect flaws in thin metal sections. Because of the large number of
variables which affect eddy-current inspections, the results of these tests
must be very carefully evaluated [147].

5-8.8 Radiation effects in pressure vessel steels.* The fast-neutron
dose experienced by an aqueous homogeneous reactor pressure vessel
during its lifetime may be greater than 5X 10" neutrons/cm? Fast-
neutron doses of this magnitude are capable of causing significant changes
in the mechanical properties of pressure vessel steels, such as loss of tensile
ductility, rise in the ductile-brittle transition temperature, and loss of
energy absorption in the notch-impact test at temperatures at which the
irradiated steel is ductile.

For several years the Homogeneous Reactor Project has supported in-
vestigations of an exploratory nature to determine the influence of radiation
effects on pressure vessel steels [148, 149, 150]. Although it is not yet
possible to give definitive answers to many of the questions posed, it has
become apparent that radiation effects in steels depend upon a large number
of factors, and the unusual properties of irradiated metals may force a
reappraisal of the usual standards for predicting service performance from
mechanical property data.

Table 5-18 lists the tensile properties of a number of irradiated pressure
vessel steels and one weld. At doses of 5 X 10'® fast neutrons/cm? appre-
ciable changes in tensile properties are observed. At doses of 1X 102°
fast neutrons/ecm? very large changes in properties are observed, and the
steels seem unsuited for use in pressure vessels in this condition because of
the limited ductility. Uniform elongation has been used as a measure of
tensile ductility because irradiation reduces the uniform elongation much
more drastically than the necking elongation. In some cases yielding and
necking occur at the same stress or, in some cases, the yield strength exceeds

the tensile strength. The loss of uniform elongation is more severe in ferritic
steels of lower carbon content (less than 0.109).

The effect of elevated irradiation temperatures is to reduce the yield
stress increase, but the tensile strength increase may be greater under the
higher temperature conditions. The uniform elongation is usually greater
for elevated temperatures of irradiation. In some cases the reduction of
area is drastically reduced by elevated temperature irradiations, and frac-
ture has occurred without necking. Thus it is not clear whether elevated
irradiation temperatures are always beneficial.

Table 5-19 lists selected data on the effects of irradiation on the notch-
impact properties of 4 number of steels. The increase in transition tempera-
ture and the percentage of loss of energy absorption are shown as a function
of neutron dose. The data were obtained on subsize 1zod impact specimens.
Limited information on full size Charpy V-notch specimens has indicated
that at doses of the order of 5 X 108 fast neutrons/cm?, larger transition
temperature shifts (by about a factor or two) are observed than with sub-
size Izod specimens. Thus there may be a size effect to be considered.

Preliminary results indicate that elevated irradiation temperatures in-
variably reduce the extent of radiation effects on the notch-impact proper-
ties, although the amount of reduction varies greatly between different
steels of similar composition and heat treatment.

The following suggestions and recommendations for the selection of
pressure vessel steels that will be irradiated in service are based upon the
data obtained:

(1) On the basis of tensile ductility (uniform elongation) steels of carbon
content greater than about 0.29 are preferable.

(2) The steel should be aluminum killed to secure a fine-grain material,
but it is not certain that a small grain size per se is preferable to a large
grain size.

(3) The processing and heat treatment should be carried out to attain
the lowest possible transition temperature before the steel is put into
service.

(4) There is some tendency for alloy steels (particularly when heat-
treated to obtain a structure that is not pearlitic) to show more severe
radiation effects than pearlitic steels. This is not to say that alloy steels
are unsuitable; but there are insufficient data to choose between the various
alloy steels.

(5) The radiation effects in steels depend both in kind and degree on
the temperature of irradiation in a very sensitive manner in the tempera-
ture ranges in which steels will be used in reactor vessels.

(6) The effects of static and cyclic stresses during irradiation on dynamic
and static properties have not yet been determined, and it is impossible
to perform a realistic evaluation of engineering properties until some
information is available.
5-9] STRESS-CORROSION CRACKING 283

(7) In the range of neutron doses to be expected in reactor vessels, the
properties of irradiated steels are extremely sensitive to dose (and perhaps
to dose rate). One of the greatest uncertainties is the comparison of the
effectiveness of test reactor fluxes and fluxes to be encountered in service.
Also, nothing is known about the rate of self-annealing at the temperature
of operation.

Currently ASTM type A-212 grade B steel made to satisfy the low-
temperature ductility requirements of ASTM A-300 specification is re-
garded as a good choice for reactor vessels. It is by no means certain that
this is the best grade of steel to use, but there are other types that seem to
be much less desirable.

5-9. STrRESS-CORROSION CRACKING*

5-9.1 Introduction. Early in the Homogeneous Reactor Project the
susceptibility of the austenitic stainless steels to failure by stress-corrosion
cracking was recognized. As a result, test exposures of stress specimens of
various kinds have been carried out in laboratory glassware, high tem-
perature autoclaves, 100-gpm dynamic loops, and in-pile loops. These
investigations, as well as a great deal of experience with the fluids of
interest in the engineering development programs, have indicated that
stress-corrosion cracking of type—347 stainless steel is not a serious problem
in these environments in the absence of {<5 ppm} chloride ions. However,
investigations carried out with added chloride ions, and some failures
which have been encountered where the fluids under test were inadvertently
contaminated with chloride ions, have shown that the several oxygenated
aqueous environments present in an operating two-region breeder can
stress-crack the austenitic stainless alloys when the chloride ions are
present. The presence of iodide and bromide ions has also resulted in
localized attack in some tests [151,152]. However, bromide ions are an
unlikely contaminant and are produced in very low yield in fission, and
the iodide formed can be removed by a silver bed [153]. Whether chloride
and bromide ions are also removed by the silver bed under reactor operating
conditions has not been established.

Thus, the successful utilization of austenitic stainless steels in homo-
geneous reactor construction is dependent on the control of localized attack,
particularly stress-corrosion cracking, by the rigid exclusion or continuous
removal of halide ions. Space does not permit a review of the many complex
factors which influence stress-corrosion cracking by chloride ions in homo-
geneous reactor fluids; however, some of the specific data and experience

*By E. G. Bohlmann.
284 INTEGRITY OF METALS IN HOMOGENEOUS REACTORS [cHAP. 5

which emphasize the necessity for halide control in homogeneous reactor
fluids contained in type—347 stainless steel are presented. In general, the
effects of the presence of chloride ions are similar to those encountered
in high-temperature water. Stress-corrosion cracking problems in such
environments in water-cooled reactors has been comprehensively reviewed
in the Corrosion and Wear Handbook [154] and so will not be considered
in any detail here.

Titanium and zirconium alloys have been tested in many aggressive
aqueous stress corrodents without ever showing susceptibility to attack.

5-9.2 Fuel systems. An early investigation of stress-corrosion cracking
in boiling uranyl-sulfate solutions involved exposure of stress specimens in
a small, atmospheric pressure, total reflux test evaporator [155] constructed
of type—347 stainless steel. Four constant-strain type—347 stainless-steel
specimens stressed to 20,000 psi by three point loading were exposed in the
solution and vapor phase. The evaporator was run without aeration other
than that resulting from the fact that the condenser was open to the
atmosphere.

No cracking of any of the specimens was observed during the 7630-hr
exposure in HRE-2 composition (0.04 m U02804-0.004-0.015 m H2SO04—
0.005 m CuSQy) solution. This solution contained less than 1 ppm chloride.
Two of the specimens, one from the liquid and one from the vapor phase,
were replaced with new specimens and the test was continued, but with
60 ppm of chloride added to the solution as sodium chloride. On examina-
tion of the specimens after 500-hr exposure in this environment, several
small eracks were found in the area of maximum stress of the new solution-
exposed specimen, No cracks were found on the new vapor-exposed speci-
men nor on any of the carryover specimens. These results were unchanged
after an additional 1880-hr exposure to the same solution except that the
cracks in the solution-exposed specimen were larger. Thus it was apparent
that stress-corrosion cracking of type—347 stainless steel at 100°C in uranyl
sulfate solutions containing chloride ions may be profoundly affected by
pretreatment.

Further investigations of this pretreatment effect in boiling uranyl
sulfate solutions in glass equipment with elastically stressed U-bend
specimens have confirmed the results obtained in the evaporator test
[156]. Table 5-20 summarizes some of the information which has been
obtained on the effect of pretreatment in a nonchloride-containing uranyl
sulfate solution on the resistance to cracking of stress specimens in subse-
quent exposure to an environment which is an aggressive crack producer
in new specimens. Thus pretreatment for a period as short as 50 hr has an
appreciable effect; also, stressing the specimen after pretreatment does
not destroy the efficacy of the solution pretreatment. A similar beneficial
5-9] STRESS-CORROSION CRACKING 285

effect was not produced by a pretreatment consisting of heating the stressed
U-bends in air for 1 hr at 677°C.

The results of some laboratory studies on the effect of chloride concen-
tration on stress-corrosion cracking of type-347 stainless steel, not pre-
treated, in acrated, boiling uranyl sulfate solutions are summarized in
Table 5-21 [157]. Under these conditions no cracking of simple beam-type

specimens was observed with chloride concentrations of 10 ppm or less
over a period of 2500 hr. However, cracking was encountered at chloride
concentrations of 25 to 500 ppm. The exposure-time intervals, after which
microscope examination revealed the first evidence of cracking, ranged
from 100 to 200 hr at 25 ppm to 2000 to 2500 hr at 100 ppm. Results of a
few experiments with added bromide and iodide ions are also given. The
bromide results are suggestive of a relatively unusual stress-accelerated
corrosion rather than cracking.

Other tests [158,159] carried out in autoclaves with oxygen overpressure
have indicated that chloride concentrations as low as 5 to 10 ppm can
cause stress-corrosion cracking of vapor phase specimens at temperatures
of 100 and 250°C. Similar specimens exposed in the solution phase suffered
no comparable attack even with chloride concentrations ranging up to
90 ppm. The quite different results obtained with changes in test condi-

tions are similar to experience with the phenomenon in other aqueous
environments.

A further seeming inconsistency is the large number of hours (> 300,000)
of operating experience accumulated on 100-gpm dynamic loops without
experiencing a failure due to stress-corrosion cracking, in spite of the fact
that a few ppm of chloride was often present in the solution. In a number
of instances 50 to 200 ppm chloride ion was deliberately added to the solu-
tion used in a particular run. The same loops were run for many thousands
of hours subsequently without stress-cracking failure. Also, in long-term
loop tests with solutions of the same composition as HRE-2 fuel, stress
specimens were exposed in liquid and vapor at 200, 250, and 300°C for
12,000 to 14,000 hr. No evidence of stress cracking was found by subse-
quent microscopic and metallographic examinations [160].

However, as more complex equipment has been operated in connection
with the component development programs a few stress-cracking failures
have been encountered. These were usually associated with erevices
stemming either from the design or formed by accumulations of sold
corrosion products. Comparison of these failures with the lack of difficulty
encountered in the loop experience suggested that the presence of high
concentrations of oxygen helped prevent stress-corrosion cracking by uranyl
sulfate solutions containing chloride ions and that the cracking encountered
in the more complex systems was related to oxygen exhaustion in the
crevices.

To test this hypothesis, two series of loop runs were carried out to study
the effect of oxygen concentration [161].

In the first of these, at 250°C, two sets of five stress specimens, one set
pretreated in situ 98 hr with chloride-free solution, the other set in the as-
machined, degreased condition, were exposed in the loop pressurizer. The
specimens were arranged so the topmost specimen was exposed to vapor
only, the next two were in the solution spray from the pressurizer bypass,
and the bottom two were immersed in the liquid phase. No effect ascribable
to exposure position was observed. Pretreated specimens were not included
in the second series of runs at 200°C. Table 5-22 summarizes the conditions
used in the runs and the results obtained:

At 250°C no cracks were produced in the specimens by varying conditions
from high oxygen concentration to oxygen exhaustion with consequent
uranium precipitation. At 200°C and high oxygen concentration, a crack
was observed underneath the head of a bolt used to fasten the specimen to
a holder instead of in the area of maximum tensile stress. The probability
that this was the crevice-type attack which had been hypothesized was
borne out by the results of the subsequent oxygen exhaustion run. After
this run all the specimens showed transgranular cracks. However, the
cracks were not characteristically related to the pattern of applied stress.

Several of the cracks were parallel rather than normal to the applied tensile
stress, and most were in the regions where the identification numbers were
stamped on the specimens rather than in the areas of maximum elastic
stress.

The aggressive stress cracking encountered in the oxygen exhaustion
run at 200°C raised the question whether similar effects might be produced
in the absence of chloride. Consequently, oxygen exhaustion studies were
carried out in loop runs with 0.17 M uranyl sulfate solutions containing
<3 ppm of chloride ions. Stress specimens exposed in such runs at 200,
250, and 280°C showed no stress-corrosion cracks on metallographic
examination [162].

In-pile experience has of necessity been substantially less extensive,
however, the results have been consistent with the negative experience
encountered with out-of-pile loops. Over a period of 2% years, about
17,000 operating hours have been accumulated in fifteen type-347 stainless-
steel in-pile loop experiments without encountering evidence of stress
cracking. Also, stress specimens were exposed in the pressurizer vapor and
liquid locations in one 1700-hr experiment. Subsequent microscopic and
metallographic examination revealed no evidence of cracks. Stress speci-
5-9] STRESS-CORROSION CRACKING 289

mens exposed in the core during a 630-hr experiment also showed no stress
cracks.

Thus, a great deal of experience and the results of many specific investi-
gations indicate stress-corrosion cracking of austenitic stainless alloys is
not a problem in uranyl sulfate solution environments free of chloride.
However, contrariwise, it also seems clear that stress-corrosion cracking
failures will be a problem if these solutions become contaminated with
chloride.

5-9.3 Slurry systems. Substantially less experience with aqueous slur-
ries than with uranyl sulfate solutions has been accumulated in austenitic
stainless steel equipment. However, it appears that stress-corrosion crack-
ing failures manifest themselves about as one might expect from high-
temperature water results. Thus the presence or absence and the concen-
tration of chloride in the slurry are major factors in stress-cracking
incidence.

Stress cracking has been encountered in toroids [163] and loops [164]
operated with oxygenated thorium-oxide slurries containing chloride. No
estimate of the concentration of chloride which is tolerable in oxygenated
slurries can be made from available data. Williams and Eckel [165] have
reported an apparent relationship between oxygen and chloride content
for the development of cracks by alkaline-phosphate treated boiler water.
These data indicate that maintenance of oxygen at concentrations of less
than 0.5 to 1 ppm will provide reasonable assurance against stress-corrosion
cracking at appreciable (10 to ~100 ppm) chloride concentrations. As a re-
sult it has been suggested that elimination of oxygen from slurry systems by
maintenance of a hydrogen overpressure on the system may be a solution
to the stress-cracking problems. A few test results indicate that this may
indeed be true under some out-of-pile conditions [166,167]; however, it is
not likely to be effective under all environmental conditions encountered
in an operating reactor. Thus, it is not clear that a hydrogen overpressure
over the radioactive aqueous fluids encountered in an operating reactor
will entirely repress the formation of oxygen by radiolytic decomposition
of the water or that other species resulting from radiation effects cannot
carry out the function of the oxygen in the stress-cracking mechanism(s)
if the oxygen 1s eliminated.

As with the uranyl sulfate solutions discussed above, there have been
some indications that stress-corrosion cracking of austenitic alloys in
oxygenated slurry use 1s more likely to occur in crevices under accumu-
lations of oxide [168].

unresolved question in the operation of such reactors. McLain [169] has
reviewed the problems attendant on the use of conventional boiler water
treatment. These problems stem from very large radiation fluxes associated
with the radioactive fuel circulating in the primary side of the exchanger.
Radiation decomposition of inhibitors such as hydrazine and sulfite and
the consequent and perhaps unpreventable production of some oxygen by
water decomposition introduce completely novel factors to a long-standing
problem. Thus stress-corrosion cracking failures originating on the second-
ary side of the type 347 heat-exchanger tubes are of concern unless rigid
chloride exclusion can be maintained. The effectiveness of inhibitors in
preventing production of appreciable oxygen in the secondary side water
of a fluid fuel heat exchanger is one of the investigational objectives of the
HRE-2. During this period rigid chloride exclusion is the only evident
preventive measure which can be taken, although the successful accumula-
tion of 700 Mwh experience on the HRI-1 fuel heat exchanger may be
evidence of some cathodic protection by the carbon steel in the shell and
tube sheet. It is probable, however, that in the future duplex 347-Inconel
tubing, with the Inconel in contact with the secondary water environment,
will be used in this application. The comprehensive investigation of stress-
corrosion cracking in chloride-containing boiler water environments carried
out in connection with the Naval Pressurized Water Reactor program
has shown that Inconel is not susceptible to cracking failure.

Other secondary systems. Chloride should also be excluded from other
aqueous environments in contact with the austenitic stainless equipment
not easily replaceable. Thus, failures have been encountered in using
chlorinated, potable water as cooling water [170] and the presence of
marking ink containing from 3000 to 18,000 ppm chloride on the surface of
stress U-bend specimen has been shown to induce cracking on exposure to
saturated oxygenated steam at 300°C [171]. The importance of the exclu-
sion of chloride from aqueous environments contained in austenitic alloys
was clearly demonstrated by the encounter with stress-corrosion cracking in
the HRE-2 leak detector system. The undetected chloride contamination
during manufacture of some of the tubing used in fabrication of the system
resulted in a rapid succession of failures in parts of the system during shake-
down operation. Subsequent penetrant and metallographic examination of
the O-ring flanges to which the system was connected revealed stress-
corrosion cracks in many of those exposed to high temperatures. As a
result, all the high-temperature flanges were replaced before the reactor
operation schedule could be continued [172,173].
