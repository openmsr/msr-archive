LITHIUM FLUORIDE-BERYLLIUM FLUORIDE BY EQUILIBRATION WITH
GASEOUS WATER-HYDROGEN FLUORIDE MIXTURES

A. L. Mathews C. F. Baes, Jr.

ABSTRACT

The transpiration method was used to equilibrate dilute
gaseous mixtures of HF and H20 in hydrogen carrier gas with
molten LiF-BeF; mixtures varying in composition from 0.25 to
0.80 BeF2, both saturated and unsaturated with crystalline
BeO, in the temperature range 500 to 700°C. The partial pres-
sure data were used to evaluate the equilibrium quotient for
the reaction of HF and H20 with solid BeO and dissolved BeFa.
Equilibrium quotients were also obtained for the formation of
oxide and hydroxide ions in the liquid phase.

These equilibrium quotients were employed to determine:
(1) thermodynamic activities of LiF and BeFj in the mixtures;
(2) thermodynamics of liquid BeFa; (3) stability of hydroxide
in the melt; and (4) solubility of BeO in the LiF-BeF2 system
as a function of temperature.

 

I. INTRODUCTION

Molten mixtures of LiF and BeF2 have been the subject of numerous
investigations in recent years primarily because of their suitability as
a carrier solvent for UF4 in fluid fueled nuclear reactors. In addition,
these solutions are especially worthy of study because the components -
highly ionic IiF and highly associated, more covalent BeFz ~- represent
extreme types of fluoride salts. Although the molten LiF-BeF system has
received considerable attention from both a practical and a theoretical
point of view, the study of its chemistry is still far from complete.
According to Everest,’ many of the investigations of beryllium fluoride
systems did not take into account the role of moisture and the resulting
hydrolysis products. If this information were available, future investi-

gators could make appropriate experimental adjustments and corrections.
The purpose of the present investigation was to study heterogeneous
reactions of the type
H20(g) + fluoride species(soln) = HF(g) + oxygen species(soln)
in the molten LiF-BeF, system. From such a study information could in
principle be obtained about: (1) the thermodynamic activities of LiF and
BeF2, (2) the solubilities and stabilities of oxides, and (3) the inter-
action of oxide with the proton and perhaps other cations in this molten
fluoride system. Information about the chemical reactivity of the compo-
nents in the molten LiF-BeF; system could be obtained from the thermodynamic
activities of LiF and BeFz2. The oxide chemistry of this system is of
interest because oxide is a principal impurity to be dealt with in prepara-
tive work and because metal oxides are known to be only sparingly soluble
in LiF-BeF, mixtures.

The presence of oxide species in the molten LiF-BeF, system, which
is currently being used as the solvent in the Molten-Salt Reactor Experi-
ment at ORNL, constitutes an undesirable impurity since inadvertent pre-
cipitation of sparingly soluble uranium (and other) oxides might result
in unstable reactor operation. One of the steps in the purification of
melts for reactor operation is sparging with a mixture of HF and Hz to
remove oxide. The present study of the equilibria involved would yield
additional guidelines for this treatment.

The reactivity of oxide with beryllium and other cations has been
investigated as a possible means of removal of reactor products, or of
uranium to be reprocessed for later use. In order for proper evaluation
of these methods to be carried out, a thorough understanding of the inter-

actions occurring in melts would be desirable. For example, the use of
H20 as the source of reactive oxygen for oxide precipitating schemes and
the use of HF for removal of oxide require that the stability of the inter-
mediate hydroxide be evaluated in the melts.

In the present study the transpiration method was used to equilibrate
dilute gaseous mixtures of HF and H20 in hydrogen carrier gas with molten
LiF-BeF; mixtures varying in composition from 0.25 to 0.80 BeFz, both sat-
urated and unsaturated with crystalline BeO, in the temperature range 500
to 700°C. The primary data from the measurements were used to evaluate
the equilibrium quotient for the reaction of HF and H20 with solid BeO end
dissolved BeFz2. Equilibrium quotients were also obtained for the formation
of oxide and hydroxide ions in the liquid phase. These quantities in turn
could be used to obtain the thermodynamic activities of LiF and BeF2 as
well as the solubility of BeO and the stability of hydroxide. Use of the
HF-H20 equilibria as a much needed analytical tool for the determination

of oxide in such melts was also indicated.
Physical Properties of the LiF-BeFa System

Beryllium fluoride is frequently found in the form of a glass rather
than a crystalline solid. The beryllium fluoride glass consists of a ran-
dom network structure in which the beryllium atoms are surrounded tetra-
hedrally by four fluorine atoms and each fluorine atom by two beryllium
atoms > Iiquid beryllium fluoride retains the polymeric character of the
glass as indicated by its high viscosity. In contrast to the covalent
nature of beryllium fluoride, lithium fluoride is a highly ionic salt.

The addition of LiF to liquid BeF; causes a breaking down of the polymeric

structure, but apparently the tetrahedral BeF42~ groups are retained.
Although it isn't proof of structure in the liquid phase, the fact that
a compound LipBeF,; can be precipitated from the melt may be some indica-
tion of the short range order in the liquid phase.

Phase behavior of the LiF-BeF; system has been studied extensively
by Thoma, et al.” A copy of their published diagram (Figure 1) is included
here to illustrate the major characteristics of the system.

The melting point of BeFa2 is 548°C; the melting point of LiF is 848°c.
The liquidus temperatures for the BeFa-rich region have been difficult to
obtain because of the high viscosity of these solutions.” A brief summary
of the phase studies of various BeFz systems is included in reference 1.
Many of these systems parallel those of the much ‘higher melting silicate
glasses.

Studies of the LiF-BeF; system in the temperature range of the pres-
ent work (500 to 700°C) are restricted to the region between the high
liquidus temperatures at low BeFz concentrations and high viscosity at

high BeF2 concentrations.

Thermodynamic Properties of the Various Possible Species

From previous studies of LiF, BeF2, and the other possible species
present, some information can be drawn about the expected behavior of the
system. The thermochemical data for BeFp; are summarized in the JANAF
Tables.” There is considerable uncertainty in on.” of BeFz2(1), which was
derived from the AH

ff 298.15
capacity functions for both the solid and liquid phases. Two sources

for the crystal and the appropriate heat

of error were cited in JANAF. The heat capacity studies were made on
samples of BeFz which contained BeO and H20. Also, the heat of fusion

is uncertain. The value of 2 kcal/mole was used in the tabulation (be-
cause of the similarity of BeFz glass to B203 and S102) even though a
value of 12.9 kcal/mole was determined from the vapor pressures over solid
and liquid BeF2. Determination of I: of BeFa(1) would help resolve some
of these difficulties.

The thermochemical properties of BeFa(g) have been based on proper-
ties of the liquid and the heat of vaporization of BeF2(1) except for the
work of Greenbaum, et al.’ who determined equilibrium constants for the
reaction
BeO(s) + 2HF(g) = BeFa(g) + Ha0(g)
over the temperature range 670 to 970°. They report that a plot of log
K vs 1/T yields a least squares slope corresponding to 20.5 * 1.7 keal/mole
for CH over the temperature range studied, and that a plot of AF, vs T
gives a value of 6.0 * 0.3 cal deg™?! mole™? for 485, by a least squares
analysis. If the calculated line for log K vs 1/T using these parameters
were drawn and the reported equilibrium quotients plotted, the line would

fall on the same side of all points. A least squares analysis using all
published data, with equal weighting for all points, gave values of AH =
20.28 * 0.84 kcal/mole and 6S = 6.67 + 0.77 cal deg”! mole”. From their
values Greenbaum, et al.” reported the on.° 20g OF BeFa(g) as -191.3 #

2.0 kcal/mole and 8%508 of BeFa(g) as 52.4 + 0.3 cal deg”! mole”. Based

cn the recalculation, the values would be -191.5 # 1.1 and 53.1 # 0.8,

respectively.

10

The vapor pressure of BeF2(1) has been studied extensively .o” Sense,

6,7 studied the vapor pressure from 745 to 1021°C. Two Russian groups®?®

et al.
have reported vapor pressure studies. All of these are in general agreement
but have slight differences. The most extensive, and probably the best,
study (550 to 950°C) was that of Greenbaum, et al 10 since the enthalpy
and entropy of vaporization are reasonably well known from these measure-
ments, a combination of this information with independently determined
entropy and enthalpy of formation of BeF2(1) should provide a new means
for evaluating the thermodynamic properties of BeFalg).

The thermodynamic values of Hz0(g), HF(g), and BeO(s) are well char-
acterized throughout the temperature range of the present measurements
(see reference 4). Thus, if the AH, can be determined for the reaction
H20(g) + BeFa(1) = 2HF(g) + BeO(s) ,
then AH," of BeF2(1) can be calculated. The greatest uncertainty in AH,°
for HF(g) is the correction which should be applied for the imperfection
at room temperature. Several recent publications have dealt with the sub-
ject. 11717 Franck and Spalthorrit reported that the enthalpy of vaporiza-
tion rises from 89.5 cal/g at 19.4°C to a max of 146 cal/g at 130°C and
decreases at higher temperature. Armitage, et 21.1? show that the various

thermodynamic properties can best be explained by assuming that HF exists
in the gas phase principally as monomers and hexemers, but no actual indi-
cation of the average molecular weight as a function of temperature or
pressure is given. Yabroff, et al 13 have summarized most past work in
their report. They conclude that HF molecules are strongly associated
into polymeric forms and that dissociation is accompanied by large changes
in enthalpy. Armstrong” and Feder, et a1.’ have considered the effect
of this association on the heat of formation of HF(g). The average molec-
ular weight of HF(g) at 1 atm and 25°C is 54, at 0.4 atm and 25°C is 22,
and at 1 atm and 80°C is 20.16 For pressures as low as a few hundredths
of an atmosphere both HF and H20 are reasonably ideal at 25°C and undoubt-
edly are ideal at melt temperatures.

From the thermodynamic quantities tabulated in JANAF, equilibrium
constants were calculated for several conceivable reactions involving HF,

H20, BeF2, BeO, and LiF. These are presented in Table 1 along with the

calculated heats of reaction. Although the equilibrium constants refer to

reactants and products which are pure solids or liquids, they could be ap-

plied to reactions in solution if appropriate activities were used. From
these data the following predictions are made:

(1) Oxygen containing compounds of Li should react to form Be compounds.
If Liz0 were added to an LiF-BeF2 melt, the Lio0 should react almost
quantitatively to form BeO and LiF. If IiOH were added to an LiF-BeFa2
melt, the LiOH should react almost quantitatively to form Be(OH)2 and
IiF.

(2) The formation of Be(OH)2 as a separate solid phase at temperatures as
high as 800°%K is very unlikely.

(3) All of the stable compounds have low volatilities at the temperatures
of interest.

A more precise determination of the oH of BeFa(1) and of the activ-

ities of BeFa and LiF in the melt would allow more quantitative predictions

of reactions in the LiF-BeF, system.
Thermodynamic Studies of Molten Salt Mixtures

The determination of thermodynamic activities of melt camponents in
molten salts has received considerable attention. Blander has summarized
mich of the work through 1962.77

The relationships between activities and activity coefficients depend
on the choice of concentration units. The most frequent unit for expressing
concentration of mixed solvents is the mole fraction. In molten salts the
ion fraction is frequently used. For systems in which all salts contain the

same anion, mole fraction and ion fraction are equal. The term "mole frac-

tion" will be used in the text.
10

According to the Temkin model, 18 in which salts are considered to be
completely ionic, the ideal activity of a component is equal to the product

of ion fractions of its constituents (a; = XX) For a solution which

J
contains only one anion, Jj, the ion fraction, X,, equals one. The ion frac-
tion of each cation is equal to the mole fraction of that component. The
activities of components are usually referred to the pure liquid (super-
cooled if necessary) as the standard state. Occasionally, the activities
are referred to the pure crystalline solid for experimental convenience.

The activities of components in solution have been measured by the fol-
lowing methods: vapor pressures, freezing point depression, electrode
potentials, and heterogeneous equilibria. The vapor pressure method is
complicated by the formation of complex species in the vapor phase. Deter-
mination of activities from freezing point depressions requires that the
heat of fusion and the £0, for the pure solid and liquid solvent be known.
Electrode potential measurements of activities are often made in cells with
liquid Junction. Such measurements are limited to dilute solutions, which
are expected to give small liquid Junction potentials.

The use of heterogeneous equilibria has thus far been limited. The

19,20 in mixtures with KCl and NaCl

activity of MgClz has been determined
by use of the equilibrium

MgClz(soln) + 202(g) = Mgo(s) + c12(g)

Blood, et 21.2% determined the activities of various metal fluorides in
LiF-BeFz; mixtures using the equilibrium

M(s) + xHF(g) = MF_(soln) + (x/2)H2(g)

In studies of this type it is important that the solid present be well

characterized and relatively insoluble and, of course, that all phases are

in equilibrium.
11

If the activity of one of the components of a binary mixture is known
as a function of composition, the other one can be determined by integration
of the Gibbs-Duhem equation. From the activities, such properties as molar
heats of mixing, excess chemical potential, vapor pressure, and phase behav-
ior can be derived.

At present, a general theory of the behavior of melts has not been
developed to the point that activities can be predicted for a system such
as ILiPF-BeFa.

The activities of LiF and BeF2 have heen reported for a limited number
of cases. Berkowitz and Chupka in 1960 reported the activities in an equi-
molar mixture from relative ion intensities during mass-spectral analysis. 2?
Recently, Bichler has reported determinations by a more careful mass-spectral
analysis and emf measurements. The emf measurements were conducted at two
temperatures in a concentration cell containing pure BeF2 in one compart-
ment and an LiF-BeF2 mixture in the other.<> Blichler used a twin crucible
assembly in his determination of activities with the mass spectrometer to
facilitate comparison of pure compound and mixture «2% The results of these

experiments are compiled in Table 2.

Solubilities of Gases in Melts

In addition to the studies of activities in melts, the solubilities
of gases have also been of interest. Watson, et a1.” have studied the
solubility of the inert gases in molten fluorides, including the LiF-BeFa2
system. All solubilities obey Henry's law and increase with increasing
temperature and with decreasing atomic weight of gas.

Burkhard and Corbett reported the solubility of water in molten
LiCl-KCl mixtures. Apparently Henry's law was obeyed for low pressures,
with the deviations above a few millimeters attributed to hydrolysis. How-
ever, no analyses were reported on the gases to determine the amount of
H,0 and HCl in the gas phase in equilibrium with the melt.

27,28

Shaffer, et al. have studied the solubility of HF in molten fluo=-

ride mixtures. In the LiF-BeF; system?S solubility of HF increases with
13

decreasing temperature and with decreasing BeFz concentration. The Henry's
law constants indicate that the solubility of HF in the LiF-BeF; system
should be less than 150 ppm per atm HF above the melt. Thus, for the pres-
ent studies with partial pressures less than 0.02 atm HF, the solubility

should be less than 3 ppm.
Determination of Oxides in Melts

Since the presence of oxide in molten halides affects many physical
and. chemical properties, quantitative procedures for determination of the
amount of oxide present have been widely sought. Goldberg, et 21.2” pro-
posed high-temperature fluorination with KBrF,; with liberated Oz measured
tensimetrically. This method works reasonably well, but the greatest un-
certainties were found with fluoride melts and with samples containing less
than 300 ppm.

Porter and Brovn-C used an inert-gas fusion technique (described by
Banks, et 21.7%) in determining oxide concentrations in molten fluorides.
Samples of the melt were withdrawn through graphite filters and the entire
sample was used in the analysis. The reported analyses indicated the rela-
tive precision was * 10% for oxide concentrations of about 0.5%. No
indication was made of applicability to lower concentrations.

32,33 has determined relative oxide solubilities in LiCl-KCl

Delarue
melts electrochemically. The concentration of oxide was determined in the
nelt with Pt-C electrodes vs a Pt-PtCly reference electrode. These results
permitted identification of a variety of reactions involving oxide.

None of the methods cited are adequate for determining oxide in the

LiF-BeF; system. From studies of oxide solubility by Baes, et al.” in
14

which weighed samples of BeQ were added to fluoride melts containing uran-
ium and zirconium, it was estimated that the solubility of BeQ was less than
1000 ppm. Determination of oxide content in filtered samples by the Goldberg

method >> however, gave very inconclusive results.
Suitable Experimental Approach

The molten salt production facility at the Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant has
made use of HF-sparging to remove oxide from solution in the form of weiter.
Since the production procedure parallels the transpiration method for deter-
mining vapor pressures of liquids, the feasibility of transpiration techniques
for an equilibrium study of the 1iF-BeF2 system was considered. Much of the
feasibility study was conducted by M. K. Kemp who determined partial pres=
sures over the ZrOz-saturated LiF-BeFa-ZrFs system and was able to estimate
the activity of ZrF4 in solution.
Transpiration Method
The transpiration method for determining vapor pressures of liquids is

well established.’ In order for the transpiration method to work satisfac-
torily in studies of heterogeneous equilibria, the following conditions
should be met:
(1) Reactions must be fast enough and flow rates must be slow enough to

allow equilibration between gas and condensed phases.
(2) Adequate stirring of liquid phases must be maintained to provide uni-

form concentrations of reactants.
(3) The vapor pressures of condensed phases must be low enough to prevent

significant loss by transport in the carrier gas.

(4) Reacting gases should be unassociated.
15

(5) An adequate means of removal and measurement of reactive gases from
the flowing gas stream must be available.

The best evidence that these conditions have been met in the present
system is described in Chapter III. The variation in flow rates and in
the amount of reaction necessary to maintain equilibrium was used to test
the validity of the first two conditions. The vapor pressure data for
BeFp 0 and LiF-Be¥s mi xtures-o indicated that very little BeF; would be
vaporized. The vapor pressure of BeO at the experimental temperatures is
insignificant.-” Although both H20 and HF are at least partially associ-
ated at room temperature, the dilute gases at melt temperatures are
expected to be ideal.

Determinations of the partial pressures of HF and Ha20 over aqueous
hydrofluoric acid solutions have been made by means of the transpiration
method © Measurements were made over solutions of 10, 20, 30, 50, and
70% hydrofluoric acid, at temperatures from O to 70°C. The HF in the car-
rier gas stream was absorbed by an aqueous KOH solution. The difference
between weight lost by the saturator and weight of HF found in gas stream
was assumed to be the amount of water removed from the saturator. Since
this difference could not be used in the present studies, a suitable
method for measuring water was needed. Xemp investigated several methods
of analysis. Condensation of samples in a cold trap with subsequent weigh-
ing and analysis for per cent HF was not satisfactory primarily because of
the small size of the samples. Adsorption of the water by a suitable des-

sicant in a weighed drying tube was not satisfactory because HF was also

adsorbed.
16

Finally, it was observed that a mixture of methanol and pyridine was
suitable for removal of water from a flowing stream even in the presence
of HF. Titration of the water with Karl Fischer Reagent could be performed
in the vessel and since Karl Fischer Reagent contains excess methanol and
pyridine, several successive titrations could be performed. Apparently the
HF reacted with excess pyridine to form a fairly soluble pyridinium hydro-
fluoride which did not interfere with the titration.

Karl Fischer Reagent consists of Iz and S02 dissolved in pyridine and
methanol (actually the "stabilized reagent" contains methylcellosolve in-
stead of methanol). Although the titration is straightforward, the

reaction occurs in two steps:

S02
- 7
Hz0 + CsHsN + CsHsN'SO2 + CsHsN'Iz — 2CsHsNH'I™ + CsHsN[ |
0
502 ©
CsHsN | + CH30H — CsHsNHOSO20CH3
0

When titrating H20 with Karl Fischer Reagent the endpoint corresponds
to the first appearance of Ip. For macrotitrations the reagent serves as
its own indicator; however, for microtitrations a more precise method is
needed. Several authors have reported suitable circuits for the amperomet-
ric determination of the endpoint. The one actually used was quite similar
to the one described by Nernitz.

Equilibria

If the molten IiF-BeF, system comes into contact with water vapor,
hydrolysis occurs releasing some HF into the gas space and leaving some
oxygen-containing species dissolved in the melt. For a closed system at
equilibrium, the amount of HF and H20 in the gas phase will depend on (1)

the amounts of HF and H20 initially introduced, (2) the solubility of HF
17

and Hp0 in the melt, (3) the concentration of oxide in the melt, (4) the
concentration of hydroxide, a reactive intermediate (in the sense that it
can exist only in the presence of HF and H20), in the melt, and (5) the
amount of HF and H20 consumed in side reactions which do not influence the
oxide reaction scheme.

If the above quantities are properly controlled or measured, useful
equilibrium data can be obtained. The reaction of HF and Hz0 at high tem-
peratures with the structural metal used (nickel) can be suppressed by the
presence of Hp. Side reactions are essentially eliminated if the purity
of melts is sufficiently high. The solubility of HF in melts in the absence
of oxygen species has been mentioned and is small compared with the best
estimates of oxide solubility. It seems reasonable to assume that water
solubility would be of the same order of magnitude as that of HF and the
experimental results supported this. One method of controlling the oxide
concentration would be saturation of the melt with a sparingly soluble
oxide such as BeO. With the above conditions set, transpiration experi-
ments can be used to control the amounts of HF and H20 introduced and to
measure the hydroxide concentration indirectly through the material differ-
ence between influent and effluent gas streams.

For a BeO-saturated, 1iF-BeFz melt with excess solid BeO present the
following equilibrium is valid:

H20(g) + BeFa(soln) == 2HF(g) + BeO(s) .
If both HF and H20 are assumed to be ideal gases and if the thermodynamic
activities of the condensed species are represented by "a", the equilibrium

constant for the reaction would be

Ky = (Pp) ®apo/Pry0®per,
18

Since 8500 is 1 by definition,

Ky = (Ppp) */Py, Pre, = Vopr,

This equilibrium is independent of the presence or absence of hydroxide in
the melt.

The quantity Fer) Pro for BeO saturated melts, defined above as Q,
can be obtained from determination of partial pressures in the gas phase
alone. Thus Q, which is proportional to the activity of BeF2, would be
equal to K, for the equilibrium involving pure liquid BeFp; at the same tem-
perature. Determination of Q for various temperatures and compositions of
BeF, provides the data necessary for thermodynamic calculations involving
the melts.

The following additional equilibria involving oxide and hydroxide ions
in the melt should also be considered. (The corresponding equilibrium quo-
tients, which are shown, may be considered constant for a given LiF-BeFa
composition and temperature since at the low concentrations of oxide and
hydroxide involved, the activity of F and the activity coefficients 792"
and 7,,- can reasonably be assumed constant.) Since [F~] is reasonably
constant for a given melt composition, [F] is incorporated into the equi~-
librium quotients.

H20(g) + 2F (soln) = 2HF(g) + 0%" (soln)

Qp = (Bp) 210%71/py

For oxide saturated melts [07] is constant, hence

Q/ 10%) pe = (Pp) /Pyz0 = Q.

There are three reactions involving hydroxide in solution.
H20(g) + F (soln) = HF(g) + OH (soln)

Qp = (Py) [0H 1/Ry
19

Hz0(g) + 027 (soln) = 20H (soln)

Q, = [om™1%/(py, ) [027]

and for a melt saturated with oxide where [0%~] is constant,
Q = [oH™12/Py .

HF(g) + 0% (soln) == OH (soln) + F (soln)

Q, = [oH }/(Pp) [037]

and for a melt saturated with oxide,

Qq = [0H )/Pg, -

Note that not all of the equilibrium quotients are independent. Since
Y is independent of [OH ] and Q is independent of [03-1], these two equi-
librium quotients are the most conveniently employed. Both Qu and Q can
be expressed as functions of and Qe
Q, = (Q,)2/q, and Q = Q/%,

The relationships for BeO saturated melts are given by
Q = (9,)%/a and Qu = Q,/Q »

Stoichiometric relationships show that the number of protons in a given
volume of effluent gas will be less than the number in the influent gas by
the amount that has appeared as OH added to the melt. If the proton level
in the effluent gas stream exceeds the level in the influent stream, OH
is being removed from the melt. The difference in Hp20 content between the
influent and effluent gas streams corresponds to the total amount of oxide
plus hydroxide being added to or removed from the melt. Iikewise, the dif-
ference in HF content between the influent and effluent gas streams corre-
sponds to the amount of fluoride being added to or removed from the melt.
For all experiments conducted, the change in fluoride was small enough so
that the LiF-BeF2 concentration in the melt was assumed to be constant

throughout a given experiment.
20

For simplicity in handling equations the following notation will be
used:
wt of melt = w(kg)
vol of gas (measured at T) through melt = V(liter)
V/wRT = W(mole kg™! atm™1)
Pup = a + W and Pup = © * dW (atm) for influent pressures
(NOTE: When the aqueous HF saturator was employed b and 4
were always O. When gas mixing was employed b and d were
small negative numbers because small opening in valve tended
to gradually close.)
Pup = X and Puyo = ¥ (atm) for effluent partial pressures
[0°] =r

[oH]
The equilibrium quotients may now be expressed as
Q = x*/y, Q = x*r/y, and Q = xs/y
Saturated Melts

For constant. influent partial pressures of H20, HF, or both there will
be an ultimate steady state condition in which the effluent partial pres-
sures are not changing, hence r and s are constant. In fact r will be
constant at all times in a given experiment unless rate of reaction to form
hydroxide and water exceeds the dissolving rate of solid BeO. The speed
with which x and y approach a steady state is controlled primarily by Q and
Qp* According to the equations described earlier, the difference in proton
level of influent and effluent streams is equal to the change in hydroxide
concentration. Thus,

ds/aw = (a + 2¢) - (x + 2y) .
21

Both ds and y may be eliminated by using the relationships Q = x2 /y and

Q = xs/y. Rearrangement of the former gives y = x%/Q. Rearrangement and
substitution into the latter gives s = Q,x/Q, which may be differentiated
to give ds = (Q,/Q)ax. Thus

ax/aw = (/Q,)[(a + 2¢) - (x + 2x%/Q)].

Separation of variables gives

dx
(a + 2) = x - (2/Q)x?

 

= (Q/Q,) aw

Defining (a + 2c) as A, this equation may be integrated to give

1 1m (4/Q)x +1 + [1 + (84/Q)]
[1+ (88/Q)12 (4/Q)x + 1 - [1 + (8A/Q)]

 

= (@/q,)w + constant

no

The correlation of experimental measurements with this equation is described
in Chapter III. The computer program for this correlation was written by
R. J. McNamee, Operations Analysis Division, ORGDP.
Unsaturated Melts

For unsaturated melts the change in r and s can be determined by mate-
rial balance. The difference between influent and effluent partial pressures
of Hp0 corresponds to the change in total oxide concentration
(dr + ds)/aw = (¢ - y)
The difference in proton levels corresponds to the change in hydroxide con-
centration just as in saturated melts
ds/aW = (a = x) + 2(c -y) =.
By difference
dr/aw = (x - a) + (y - ¢) .

Combination of these equations with Q, = xs/y and Qp = x%r/y could, in
22

principle, yield integral equations expressing Q and Q as a function of
the measured quantities. However, the resulting pair of simultaneous dif-
ferential equations could not be integrated. The following simultaneous
differential equations were obtained by elimination of x and y from the
expressions for dr/dW and ds/dw:

ds/aw = (a + 2c) - (Qgs/Q,r) (1 + 2s/Q,)

and

dr/aw

(qus/ar)(1 + s/Q,) - (a +c)
These equations could be solved in the differential form to obtain values
of r and s as a function of W for specified values of and Qe If r,
5, Q and Qp are specified at a given W, values for x and y may be calcu-
lated.

The method of solution of the equations and the correlation of experi-
mental data by this method are described in Chapter III. The computer
program for this correlation, "FIASCO", was written by M. T. Harkrider,

ORNL Mathematics Division.

II. EXPERIMENTAL
Chemicals

Gases

Commercial Hz was purified before use by passage through a deoxo unit,
a magnesium perchlorate drying tube and, finally, a liquid Nz trap. Com-
mercial He was passed through an ascarite trap, a magnesium perchlorate
drying tube and, finally, a liquid Nz trap. Anhydrous HF was used directly
from a commercial cylinder without further purification. B & A reagent
grade 48% hydrofluoric acid was used as the source of HF(g) and Ha0(g).
Melt Components

Beryllium fluoride was from Brush Beryllium Company (material to be
used in preparing the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment fuel salt). Lithium
fluoride was B & A reagent grade. Various mixtures were prepared by melt-
ing together weighed samples of the two components. Samples of the mixtures
were withdrawn in filter sticks and analyzed for Be, Li, F and impurities
(Fe, Cr, Ni, Cu and S). High purity BeO from Brush Beryllium Company was
added to the melts which were used in studies of oxide saturated melts.
Standard Reagents

Reagent grade KOH was used in the preparation of 0.1 N base which was
standardized with potassium acid phthalate. Karl Fischer Reagent from
Fisher Chemical Company (So-K-3) was standardized by direct addition of

weighed aliquots of water.
24
Apparatus

Experiments were carried out by means of a transpiration method. The

stepwise sequence of processes was as follows:

Measurement of volume of

A complete flow diagram of the apparatus is shown in Figure 2.
Flow Control Panel

The manifold gas pressures (Hp and He) were not constant but varied,
generally, between 5 and 10 1b gauge. A pressure relief valve (Moore
Products Campany differential type flow controller, Model 63BD, modified
form) was used to reduce this pressure to a constant value of 3.0 1b gauge.
The gas next passed through a Fisher-Porter Rotameter which was used only
as a visual check of the flow rate. The pressure was measured with a 4=-in.
Ashcroft gauge graduated in 1/4-1b divisions from O to 15 1b above atmos-
pheric pressure. The brass needle valve with micrometer handle was from

prevent back flow of gas. The Hz line to the aqueous HF saturator was also
connected to a water filled manometer from which the pressure immediately
upstream of the saturator could be determined. The various pieces on the
panel were connected by 1/4-in. Cu tubing using mechanical Swagelok fittings.

An alternate flow control system, identical with the above except for
the H20 manometer, was used to control the carrier gas for the anhydrous HF
system.

Aqueous HF Saturstor

 

When HF and H20 were both desired in the influent gas, aqueous solu-
tions of HF were employed. The Hz from the flow control panel passed first
through a dry bottle, next the filled saturator, and then another dry bottle
which acted as a trap for liquid droplets. Both the bottles and the satu-
rator were machined from Teflon bar stock. The two bottles were 24-1in.
diameter with a capacity of 300 ml. The saturator was a two-piece spiral
gas-washing bottle (3-in. outside diameter top, 2-in. bottom) with approx-
imately the same volume as the dry bottles. ILids for the three were screw-
type with 45° shoulders which made pressure seals. The tube openings were
threaded for compression-type nuts which sealed the tubes in place when
tightened. The connecting line from the flow control panel and between the
bottles was of 1/4-in. Teflon tubing.

The saturator and dry bottles were in a constant temperature bath, the
temperature of which was used to control the partial pressures of HF and
H20. The temperature could be controlled 2 0.1°C from 15 to 25°C. The bath
was continuously cooled by a water coil while heating was controlled by a

mercury-mercury contact thermostat and an electronic relay.
Anhydrous HF Mixing System

 

For studies requiring anhydrous org), controlled gas mixing was
employed. The manifold HF pressure was controlled by regulating the tem-
perature of the HF supply cylinder. The flow of HF was controlled by a
small-orifice Monel diaphragm valve. The HF flowed from the valve through
a 6-mil capillary to the mixing chamber, a 1/4-in. Cu tube about 3 in.
long. The HF entered at one end of the mixing chamber; the Hz entered at
the other end through a 1/8-in. Cu tube which extended the length of the
chamber to the point where the HF capillary ended. The mixed gases flowed
out through a sidearm. This system was adapted from one designed by
G. Long which was suitable for HF pressures from about 3 x 10-2 atm down-
ward. *?

Reaction Vessel

The melts were contained in cylindrical vessels (2-in. diam, 15-in.
long; or 4-in. diam, 15-in. long) constructed of Grade A nickel. Each
vessel was equipped with the following: a thermocouple well and a gas-
inlet tube (1/4-in. tubing) each of which reached to within 1/2 in. of
the bottom of the vessel; a cover gas line (1/4-in. tubing) with an at-
tached 6-in. Ashcroft Duragauge graduated from 30-in. vac to 30-1b gauge;
and a sampling port (a 3/8-in. pipe with the end closed by a 1/2-in.
Worcester ball valve). A sidearm on the sampling port of 1/4-in. tubing
served as the gas-outlet line.

The sampling port could be connected to either a sampling apparatus
or an addition apparatus. These apparatus (developed and in common use
“)

in molten salt studies at ORNL allow removal of samples from the melt

in Cu filter sticks with subsequent transfer to a dry box under He
28

atmosphere, and addition of weighed salt samples to the melt under a dry
He atmosphere.

The reaction vessel was located inside an upright tube furnace, the
temperature of which was controlled by an L & N Speedomax H Temperature
Controller with Model S Recorder and a Chromel-Alumel thermocouple. The
temperature was checked periodically with a calibrated Pt vs Pt-10% Rh
thermocouple and an L & N K-2 Potentiometer.

The gas lines from the saturator and the HF mixing chamber to the
reaction vessel and from the vessel to the titration assembly were of
1/4~in. Cu tubing. Monel sealed-diaphragm valves were connected by means
of silver-soldered joints. Both the lines and valves were heated to about
100°C with heating tape as precaution against condensation or surface ad-~
sorption of the HF or HzO.

Titration Assembly

The Karl Fischer titration vessel was a 300-ml round-bottom flask
with the following additions: two Pt wires fused through the bottom of
the flask about 3/4 in. apart; a sidearm added to the bottom to allow
drainage of the flask; two buret tips (for 5-ml Koch microburets with 150-
ml reservoir) fused through the top of the vessel about 3 in. apart. The
solution was stirred by a small bar magnet under the Pt wires. Teflon
gas-inlet and gas-outlet lines were fitted through a rubber stopper.

The endpoint was determined by an amperometric method using the "dead-
stop" technique.” The indicator circuit consisted of the following:
1.5-v dc source, a 10% ohm variable resistor, a 500 ohm variable resistor,
the Pt electrodes, and a microammeter (all connected in series). With

excess Karl Fischer Reagent present the variable resistors were adjusted
29

so that a current of more than 100 pa was observed. With excess water
present the current was less than 2 pa. The endpoint was taken as the
point at which the current was 50 pa.

The KOH titration vessel was a 175-ml test tube. Teflon gas-inlet
and gas-outlet lines, and the tip of a 10-ml ILab-Crest microburet were
fitted through a rubber stopper. Phenolphthalein indicator was used.

Gas Volume Measurement

 

The carrier gas from the titration assembly was bubbled through a
bottle containing KOH solution (to remove acidic vapors from the Karl
Fischer Apparatus) and then through a bottle containing Hz20 [to saturate
with H20(g) at room temperature] before its volume was measured in a
Precision Wet Test Meter. The gas-exit line from the Wet Test Meter was

connected to a Bubble-O-Meter which was used to measure flow rates.
Procedure

Measurements
The primary experimental quantities needed were the partial pressures
of HF and Hz0 over the melt.
Titrations.--Measurements for determination of partial pressures were
made as follows:
(1) A measured volume of standardized reagent was added to a titration
vessel.
(2) The time required for the flowing gas to neutralize the reagent
was determined.
(3) The flow rate of gas was determined at room temperature by timing

a soap bubble for 100 ml. Since diffusion of Hz through the bubble
(4)

(5)

(6)

30

would lead to lower indicated flow rates than the true flow
rates, at least one bubble before and one bubble after the one
being timed were employed to help decrease diffusion of Ha.
Usually, at least three successive titrations were carried

out with a given reagent and then the gas flow was switched to
the other titration vessel for a similar number of titrations.
The initial volume for a series of titrations was recorded from
the wet~test meter, which indicated continuously the total gas
volume which had passed through the reaction vessel during an
experiment. The meter could be read only to the nearest 10 ml,
which was a precise enough reading for total volume but not for
individual titrations. The gas volumes titrated were calculated
from the flow rate and time of titration.

The temperature of the wet-test meter, which was the temperature
of the gas as it was being measured, was recorded.

Calculations .-~-The required calculations to evaluate the partial

pressures were carried out as follows:

(1)

The measured volume of gas was calculated by

(Time of titration)/(Time per 100 ml) x 100 = ml of gas.

(2) The number of millimoles of the component removed from the gas

stream by the titration was calculated by

(ml reagent)(conc reagent) = millimoles component (HF or Hz0).

(3) The partial pressure of the component was calculated from ideal

gas law by

Pe omponent = (millimoles component )(0.08206) (temp wet-test meter)/

(ml gas)
3

Limitations.--The apparatus as employed did pose some limitations
on the procedure. The aqueous HF saturator as designed could not accom-
modate flow rates greater than 200 ml/min without bumping. For consis-
tency, comparable flow rates were used with the anhydrous HF systen.

Under operating conditions both the Karl Fischer titration vessel
and the KOH titration vessel were checked to verify that they were able
to remove quantitatively the HO and HF, respectively, from the flowing
gas stream. In both instances two vessels were set up in series and the
leak-through from the first determined the second. The amounts of HF and
H20 titrated in the downstream vessels were less than 0.1% of the amounts
measured in the upstream vessels.

The Karl Fischer titration vessel was also checked against in-leakage
of moisture from the atmosphere. The amount of Karl Fischer Reagent needed
to maintain the endpoint with no gas flowing through the vessel was about
0.07 ml/hr. This correction was applied to pressures below 1 x 1073 atm
when it altered the observed results by as much as 1%.

Since the titration vessels were operated at room temperature, in
order to avoid condensation, the max pressures of HF and H20 were limited
to the vapor pressures above aqueous HF solutions at the same temperature.

Even for pressures below these limits some surface adsorption was
encountered. When the flowing gas stream was switched through the Karl
Fischer apparatus, the Pr.0 determined for the first few tenths of a liter
would be lower than the following determination. Therefore, the first
titration of about 0.3 ml Karl Fischer Reagent was not recorded after the

switch was made. Dehydrdtion of the Teflon was observed after the flow-

ing gas was stopped. Additional Karl Fischer Reagent was necessary to
32

maintain the endpoint. (This was much in excess of the amount due to in-
leakage discussed above and due to the untitrated gaseous water in the dip-

line.) The same problem was not observed with P._, measurements, but usually

or
a small aliquot of KOH was added to vessel during switching to allow stabi-
lization of flow before titrations were begun.
Systematic Errors

The preceding method of calculating partial pressures included the
assumption that the pressure in the apparatus from the saturator to the
wet-test meter was constant and that the amount of material was the same
at every stage. The assumption was also made that the measured volume
was equal to the volume of carrier gas plus reactive components, HF and
H20. These assumptions were not completely valid, but it will be shown

in the following sections that the resulting systematic errors were small.

The following notation will be used in the discussion of systematic

errors:

T_ = temperature of melt, °K

I, = temperature of wet-test meter, °k
P, = total pressure at wet-test meter
p, = vapor pressure of water at I,

(ny, ORT), + (ny RT D/P

(The effect of any non-ideality of HF or H20 at the low partial pressures
involved here is expected to be negligible.)

According to these calculations, the x and y values calculated in
the preceding section should be multiplied by the factor f, where
P- (x + y)
f = JL A -*
P_ - Py,
The max and min values for f can be estimated. P, = gtmospheric pressure;

(x + y) varies fram O to 0.033 atm, but generally is between 0.013 and
34

0.020 atm; p, is between 0.029 and 0.035 depending on T The maximum
value for f would be 1.00/0.965 = 1.037. The minimum value for f would
be 0.967/0.971 = 0.996. For the majority of measurements,

0.980/0.970 < £ < 0.987/0.970 ; 1.013 < f < 1.0196 .

Thus the calculated partial pressures are too low by 1.0 to 2.0% due to
the removal of HF and H20 and subsequent saturation with HzO vapor before
the volume of carrier was measured.

Another effect, which exerts a minor influence on pressure measure-
ments, is the pressure drop, between the gas space above the melt and
atmospheric pressure, required to maintain bubbling through the titrator
and wet-test meter. This drop was less than 0.01 atm, and would cause
the measured values to be low by as much as 1.0%.

Influent Pressure.--The influent partial pressures were measured
with the gas bypassing the reaction vessel. The influent partial pressures
are controlled by the saturator temperature and are independent of the
total pressure. The total pressure in the saturator was less during the
measurements of the influent gas composition than when the gas was pass-
ing through the melt by the pressure drop required to maintain bubbling,
vhich was about 0.015 atm. This pressure drop results in an expansion
of the gas as it enters the reaction vessel, hence the actual influent
partial pressures of HF and Hp0O are less than the measured influent par-
tial pressures by 1.5%.

Hydrogen Diffusion.--According to published diffusion coefficients
the diffusion of Hz out of the Ni vessel could be a few milliliters per
minute at the elevated temperature of the vessel. Only the reaction ves-

sel was sufficiently hot to allow diffusion of hydrogen.
35

The rate of diffusion was measured experimentally by pressurizing
an empty vessel to 5 1b gauge and following the decrease in pressure as
a function of time. The pressures were measured down to 10 in. vacuum.

A control experiment with He was used to check against leakage. The fol-
lowing rates of diffusion (expressed as the volume of gas per second
which would be measured at the wet-test meter; i.e. at T, and P.) were
determined: 700°C, 0.035 ml/sec; 650°C, 0.025 ml/sec; 600°C, 0.015 m1/
sec. The rate of diffusion of Hz out of a vessel containing salt should
be no greater and probably not much less than for an empty vessel.

The influent partial pressures from the aqueous saturator were deter-
mined without loss of Hz by diffusion since the gas bypassed the vessel.
If the influent gas were passed through a vessel with no salt present,
the measured partial pressures would be greater due to this effect, by
an amount dependent on the temperature and flow rate.

Most experiments were conducted with flow rates between 2.0 and 2.5
ml/sec. This means the apparent influent pressures would be from l.4 to
1.75% higher at 700°C; 1.0 to 1.25% higher at 650°C; and 0.60 to 0.75%
higher at 600°C than the measured influent pressures. The difference
would be less at lower temperatures.

Hydrogen diffusion did not play the same role when the anhydrous HF
supply system was used. The flow of HF through the control valve was
independent of the flow rate of Hz, hence the amount of HF was determined
as a function of time and the influent Pup was calculated from this value
and the effluent flow rate.

The effect of diffusion of Hz out of the reaction vessel need not

have been as great as indicated above. The mixing of the effluent gas,
36

primarily through turbulence, could have permitted re-equilibration of
the gas with the melt. This would reduce the error caused by loss of hy=-
drogen from the system by diffusion.

Dead -volume.--The preceding errors reflect the variations in pressure
and mass of flowing gas. There is one additional error in the pressure
determination at a given volume. This is the lag in measured pressures
because of the volume of the gas space above the melt. The following addi-
tional notation will be used:

T = temperature of gas above the melt, °k

Va = volume of gas space above the melt
Pi = partial pressure of HF or Hp0 leaving the melt
P2 = measured partial pressure

dV = increment of gas flowing through system as measured at IT. P, .

From the mixing process,

moles of substance entering V = (Pav) /(RT,)

moles of substance leaving V = (P2av)/(RT,)

change of moles in Vi = (v ap2)/(RT ) .

Thus,

(v,ap2)/(RL ) = (P1av)/(RT,) - (P2dV)/(RT )

and rearranging,

Py = v, (T/T )(dP2/av) + Pp

For most experiments, V = 0.400 liters and T_ = 300K. When T= 773%,
— — — Oo -— —

(T/T) = (300/773) = 0.388 and when T= 973°K, (/T ) = (300/973) =

0.308.

Therefore, at 500°C

Py = 0.1552(dP,/dv) + Pa
37

and at 700°C
Py = 0.1232(dP2/dv) + Pa

The most dramatic change in Pz occurred in the experiments when water
was introduced into melts which contained very little oxide. The maximum
rate of pressure change noted was 0.01 atm/liter. Therefore,

Py = 1.55 x 1073 + Pp

This large change occurred only during the first liter and only in the HF
measurements. During this time Pp increased to about 1 x 10~2 atm so that
the error in these unusual circumstances was only about 10%. At all other
times the change was less than 1 x 1074 atm/liter and often less than 1 x
10-7 atm/liter. For all of these conditions the error would be much smaller
than 1.0%.

This treatment assumes no further equilibration after the bubble leaves
the melt. If any did occur then application of the above equation would be
an overcorrection.

Summary .--The combined effect of these systematic errors on the over-
all accuracy of the results will now be considered.

Due to the measured-volume error all observed partial pressures were
1.0 to 2.0% low. The other errors do not affect the observed partial pres-
sures but do affect the material balance relationships used in treating the
data.

The calculated values of Q (i.e., x2/y) are 1.0 to 2.0% low for all
cases. This range is within the experimental scatter of the data. No
bias is introduced in calculation of activities because of the extrapola-
tion to pure BeF2. The extrapolated thermodynamic values for BeFa(l) are

well within the precision of literature data. No comparison of influent
38

and effluent pressures is required and diffusion of H, should not influence
results.

The expected effects on Qu» (x/y)loH"], are within the scatter of
the data. The quantity, (x/y), will not be affected by any of the errors.
The hydroxide concentration is based on proton material balance between
influent and effluent gas. Thus, due to the error in measured influent
pressures, the hydroxide concentration should be decreased by 1.5%. Due
to the error caused by diffusion of hydrogen, the hydroxide concentration
should be increased by 0.5 to 1.75% depending on temperature and flow rate.
Since the hydroxide concentration is proportional to Qp 2 the calculated
values for Qu could range from 1.0% high to 0.25% low. This range is
well within the indicated scatter of data, with Q generally known only
to * 10%.

For unsaturated melts, % is based on the difference between oxygen
material balance and proton material balance. Q is subject to the same
corrections as Qps hence it is from 1.0% high to 0.25% low. The quanti-
ties 5 and Qu are derived from Q and Q, hence they are in error in the
same manner.

Random Errors

In order to give a satisfactory estimate of the expected precision
of the experimental measurements, the various random errors and their
probable magnitudes are considered.

Melt Composition.--The melts were prepared by adding weighed samples
of BeFp and LiF to the reaction vessel. The precision of weighing and
transferring samples to the vessel was about # 0.2%. The weight per cent of

Li, Be and F was determined chemically on filtered samples. The variation
39

in analyses of successive samples from the same melt was generally * 4%
for each constituent, which was clearly greater than the uncertainty based
on weights of components. Since both LiF and BeFaz are hygroscopic, small
amounts of water were included in the weighed samples. Determination of
moisture content of typical samples by the thermogravimetric method indi-
cated 0.1 and 0.4% moisture, respectively. Thus, on the basis of the
above uncertainties in weight and moisture content, the melt compositions,
expressed as mole fraction BeFz, were probably known within 0.5%.

The amounts of the impurities Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni and S were determined
in the starting materials, in filtered samples of the melt after it had
been sparged with Hz for more than 48 hr, and again immediately after
sparging for 6 hr with a dilute mixture of HF and H20 in Hz. All analyses
were within the following range: Cr always less than 20 ppm, Cu always
less than 100 ppm, Fe usually between 100 and 200 ppm, Ni usually less
than 20 ppm, and S always less than 5 ppm. Total measured impurities only
amount to about 350 ppm which is not significant in terms of melt composi-
tion.

The impurities could, however, cause some uncertainty in the partial
pressure measurements if the impurities reacted to liberate or consume HF
or HzO during an experiment. Consumption of HF would have occurred if
sulfide had been present in concentrations greater than 5 ppm by the reac-
tion of $2” with HF in a manner analogous to the reaction of oxide with wr.
Since the impurity levels were not appreciably decreased during the Ha
sparging, the impurities apparently were not reduced to the metallic state.

The results of Blood's study on the stability of the difluorides of nickel,

iron and chromium indicate they should eventually be reduced. However,
40

most of the reactions he studied required several days for equilibration.
His results indicate that: the Ni reaction vessel would not react with
HF to produce NiFa concentrations greater than 0.1 ppm with the highest
(Pye) 2 /Py, ratios employed here; the Cr would have been in the Cr¥F; state
for all (Pp) ?/Py, ratios above 1 x 10”8 (true at all times except for
extended stripping with Hz); the FeF2 concentration could have varied be-
tween the time when Hz wes used and when (Pp) ?/Py, = 4 x 10~% atm.

The Fe probably did not react rapidly enough to interfere (or the
analyses were in error) as indicated by the following experiment. Anhy-
drous HF-H, mixtures (approximately 0.01 atm HF) were employed to remove
oxide and hydroxide from melt. After the melt was essentially free of

oxide, the effluent P.., equaled the influent P,.,. The HF was then stopped

HF HE

and Hz continued. The total amount of HF stripped out was about 5 ppm and
was probably due to HF solubility. If the Fe had been appreciably reduced,
more HF would have been detectable in the stripping gas.

Melt Temperature.--The temperature of the melt varied about * 0.5°
during the furnace heating and cooling cycle. The observed temperature
with the thermocouple at different depths in the melt did not vary more
than + 1.0%. Overall, the temperature of a melt was known and constant
to + 1.5%. One exception to the low temperature variation with dept oc=-
curred when large amounts of solid IiF were in the melt. In this case
the temperature read about 15 to 20° lower at complete insertion of the
thermocouple than when the thermocouple was withdrawn about 1 in. from
the bottom. Even in this case the temperature varied no more than # 2°

when the thermocouple was withdrawn further. Apparently the solid LiF

settled to the bottom and was not stirred by the bubbling, and as a
41

result, loss of heat out of the end of the vessel was faster than the
transfer of heat from the liquid to unstirred solid.

Titer Precision.--A 25-liter reservoir of KOH was standardized with
potassium acid phthalate before initial use and again approximately 3 and
6 months later. All values agreed with the average value * 0.1%.

The 150-ml reservoir of the Karl Fischer apparatus was filled as
needed from quart bottles of Karl Fischer Reagent. The reagent was stan-
dardized each time the reservoir was filled and frequently thereafter.
water (0.050 to 0.080 g) was added directly to the titration vessel from
a weighing buret and the Karl Fischer titer determined. Successive titra-
tions agreed within * 0.3%. Usually the concentration change from one
standardization to the next would not exceed 1%. The precision in measur-
ing the concentration of Karl Fischer Reagent was * 0.5%.

The volumes of both KOH and Kexrl Fischer Reagent used in standardiza-
tions were large enough so that the uncertainties in reading the burets
could be ignored. However, the much smaller volumes used during experi-
mental titrations were known only to * 1.0%.

Wet-test Meter Temperature.--The wet-test meter temperature, which

 

was the temperature of the gas as its volume was being measured, varied
no more than 0.5° during a given experiment. Due to the variation in
temperature, the variation in measured volume is about * 0.2%, including
the effect due to the change in vapor pressure of water.

Endpoint Precision.--The precision in the timing of endpoints was
constant at * 0.5% of the measured value.

Flow-rate Precision.--The precision in the timing of flow rates was
0.1 second per 100 ml. For a typical value of 50 seconds per 100 ml, this

would amount to 0.2%.
42

Statistical Error Analysis

 

The probable error in the calculated quantities can be determined from
the magnitude of random errors in the various measurements. If the contri-
bution of each observable, qs to the calculated function, Q, is known and
expressed as

a b
Q=1(q1y Qa sy seeeee y a") ’

and (29/Q) x 100 is % probable error in Q and (rq, /q,) x 100 is % probable
error in 9 the contribution of errors can be calculated. If the errors
follow a normal distribution, it can be shown’ that the following equa-
tion allows for partial cancellation of errors of opposite sign:

(2a/Q)? = a?(2a1/01)? + p3(2q2/q2)% + «venus + m?(aq fa )2

Evaluating the above equation numerically for each observable and taking
the square root of both sides will give the probable error in the calcu-~
lated quantity.

Volume of Gas THtrated.--

 

ml of gas = f(time of titration, time of flow measurement )
(tml gas/ml gas)? = (0.005)2 + (0.002)% = 29 x 10~°
% probable error in vol of gas = 0.54%.

Millimoles H20 Titrated by Aligquot.--

 

millimoles Hp0 = f(cone Karl Fischer Reagent, vol Karl Fischer Reagent)
(amillimoles HaO/millimoles H20)2 = (0.005)2% + (0.010)2% = 125 x 107°
% probable error in millimoles Hz0 = 1.11%.

Millimoles HF Titrated by Aliquot.--

 

millimoles HF = f(conc KOH, vol KOH)
(tmillimoles HF/millimoles HF)? = (0.001)2 + (0.010)? = 101 x 1076

% probable error in millimoles HF = 1.00%.
43

Pressure HpO«--
Pi,0 = f(vol gas, millimoles Hz0, wet-test meter temp)

(Py o/Py,0)° = (0.0054)% + (0.0111)? + (0.002)? = 154 x 107°
% probable error in pressure Hz0 = 1.24%.
Pressure HF.--
Pur = f(vol gas, millimoles HF, wet-test meter temp)
(8P pr /Pr) ? = (0.0054)% + (0.010)% + (0.002)? = 133 x 1076

% probable error in P._, = 1.15%.

HF
Equilibrium Quotients.--The exact relationship of Q, Q and Q to
all of the variables cannot be expressed in the proper form to calculate
the expected uncertainty. However, use of only the dependence on the
pressure measurements would lead to 2.5, 4.0 and 4.7%, respectively, as
the most precise possible determinations. Both Qu and Q depend on inte-

gral relationships between influent and effluent gas which increase the

uncertainty still further.

III. RESULTS
Tabulation

Saturated Melts

Appendix A contains the data from each experiment performed on a
saturated meit. The experiments are arranged according to a three digit
"Run No." which indicates chronological order. Here, and throughout the
text, numbers preceding "BeF2" denote mole fraction. In the 100 series
the first experiments (101-123) were run in a 2-in.-diam vessel on 305 g
of 0.316 BeF2 and 6 g BeO, whereas, for the later experiments (125-129),
enough BeFy was added to give 0.333 BeFa.

In the 200 series a 4-in.-diam vessel was charged with 1522 g of
0.80 BeF2 and 10 g BeO for the first experiments (201-213). After this
composition was studied, enough IiF was added to give 0.70 (215-223),
0.60 (225-233), 0.50 (235-241), 0.40 (245-255) and 0.333 BeFap (257-273).

In the 400 series the first experiments (401-409) were run on 0.30
BeF2 obtained by adding 44 g LiF and 3.0 g BeO to the melt used in the
300 series. For the later experiments (413-423) 87 g additional LiF was
added to give 0.25 BeF;.

The parameters listed in Appendix A are:

w = wt of melt, kg

T = temperature of wet-test meter, °k
a = influent Pr, atm x 10°
= 3 3
¢ = influent Pra0? atm x 10 .
The effluent partial pressures, Pi = x and Py, = Vs ore tabulated (atm

x 103) with the corresponding initial and final values of W. Note that
45

the use of W allows consistent comparison of experiments independent of
the weight of melt or temperature of gas-measurement.
Unsaturated Melts

Appendix B contains the data from each experiment performed on an
unsaturated melt. These experiments are also arranged according to a
three digit "Run No." In the 300 series a 2-in.-diam vessel was charged
with 500 g of 0.333 BeFz and anhydrous HF was used to remove oxide from
the melt. Measurements then were made while an aqueous-HF gas stream
was being passed through the melt.

In the 500 series the first experiments (501-527) were run in a 2-in.-
diam vessel containing 500 g of 0.333 BeFz. For the later experiments
(529-539) enough LiF was added to give 0.273 BeFp. Measurements were made
both while anhydrous HF was being used to remove oxide from solution and
while an agqueous-HF gas stream was being used to add oxide to solution.

In the 600 series a 2-in.-diam vessel was charged with 424 g of 0.60
BeF, for the first experiments (601-615). For the later experiments (617-
627) LiF was added to give 567 g of 0.40 BeFa. Measurements were made
during both the removal and addition of oxide.

The format of Appendix B is identical to that of Appendix A except
that influent pressures are reported as P__, =a + bW and PH.0 =c + dW

HF

when gas-mixing method was employed.
Determination of Equilibrium Quotients

The experimental data were correlated according to the model presented

in Chapter I. Computer methods were developed for these correlations.
Saturated Melts

The experiments fall into the following three groups:

Case I. Measurements were made while both Pur and P were still chang-

H»0

ing but were stopped before steady state was reached.

Case II. Partial pressure measurements were made only after Pup and Pr,0

had reached steady state.

Case III. Measurements were made in both the changing- and steady-state

regions.

The program was designed to handle all three cases with only Case I

requiring additional input information. In all cases, since x and y were

determined alternately, direct calculation of Q would require interpola-

tion, which was not very satisfactory where x and y were volume dependent.

1.

The procedure of solution is outlined in the following steps:

For Case I, Q was specified as part of input information. For Cases
IT and III, Q was not specified; the computer started with the largest
value of W and compiled average x and y as it moved to successively
lower values of W until the partial pressures became lower than the
average to that point by a specified amount (usually 4%). Safeguards
were build in to prevent the computer prematurely terminating this
process because of unusual scatter.

Using all of the partial pressures selected above, the average value
of x and the average value of y were calculated and their standard
deviations were expressed at the 99% confidence level. The best Q
was calculated from these averaged partial pressures and its standard

deviation was calculated from the deviation of its component parts.
47

3. Using the Q calculated (or Q provided if Case I), each observed y was
1
converted to a corresponding x using the relationship x = (qy)2, for
the initial region not used in the determination of Q.

4. Next, for each x (observed or calculated from observed y) the quantity

(4/Q)x +1 + [1 + (8a/Q) 12
log = £(w)

(4/Q)x +1 - [1 + (84/Q)]

 

oj

(this relationship was derived in Chapter I) was determined and tabu-
lated along with the midpoint, Ws for each observation.

5. These £(W) were now correlated according to the equation

1
£(w) = [1+ (8/9))2 q (1/a, wv + constant
2.303
to obtain the best value of Qp* The standard deviation in Qu was cal-
culated by normal method for slope in a straight line correlation.

6. At this point a consistency check was made - the deviations from the
best fit were determined to see if the observed values of x were con=-
sistently on one side of the line and values of x calculated from
observed values of y on the other side. If a difference had occurred,
Q could be readjusted or Q determined from x and y separately.

Steps 1 and 2 complete the calculation for Case III. Steps 1 through 6
complete the calculation for each experiment.
Several examples of the various cases are given in Figures 3, 4, and 5.

An example of Case I is given in Figure 3a, with the observed values of

x and y indicated by short bars. The line is generated by using the values

for Q and Qu determined by the correlation. Figure 3b is a plot of £(W)

vs W, indicating the linearity of the relationship. Figure 4a gives an

example of Case III. The flat portion was used to determine Q. Qu was
48

determined from the initial region by holding Q constant. A plot of £{(W)
vs W is given in Figure 4b for the applicable region of the above run.
Another example of Case I is given in Figure 5a showing the decrease in
x and y when influent HF and Hz0 were stopped and hydrogen sparging con-
tinued. Figure 5b gives a plot of £(W) vs W showing that the function
also holds when influent pressures are zero.

The values obtained for Q and QU from all of the saturated-melt ex-
periments are presented in Table 3. The values are arranged according to
composition and temperature of melt. Run numbers are provided for cross

reference with original data in Appendix A.

Unsaturated Melts

Determinations of equilibrium quotients involving oxide and hydroxide
were based on material balance between influent and effluent gas. The
differential equations needed for this correlation were developed in Chapter
I. These equations were:
dr/av = (Qpe/Qyr)(1 +8Q,) -[a +c + (pb + a)wl
and

ds/aw

i

a +2 + (b+ 24)W - (Qps/Qyr) (1 + 2s/Q,) .

A computer program was developed for the simultaneous solution of
these differential equations using the Runga-Cutta method of solution.”
This calculation required that the adjustable parameters, Qe Qs Tos and
S42 and the fixed parameters, a, b, c, and 4d, be specified. With all of
these quantities chosen, the change in r and s with respect to W was calcu=-
lated and new values estimated for r and s after the increment AW. The
cycle was then repeated stepwise and the process continued until a value
of W larger than a specified limit, Wax? was reached. In order to deter-
mine r and s precisely without significant accumulative errors the step
size, AW, had to be restricted so that neither r nor s could change by
more than 10% for any step. Values for r and s were tabulated at the var=-
ious values of W corresponding to the end of each step.

With both r and s known, both x and y could be calculated using the
equilibrium relationships. If the relationships
Q = xs/y and AQ = xr /y
are solved simultaneously,

X= Qs/Qyr and v = Qys2/Qy°r .
55

These calculated values of x and y form smooth continuous curves al-
though exact equations for the curves could not be expressed. The deviation
of the observed x and y values from the calculated values was determined.

A general least squares method was used to improve the fit. The partial
derivatives of the x and y curves were determined numerically by making
slight changes in each adjustable parameter (Qy» Qs Tos 5.) successively.
From the deviations and partial derivatives the adjustments in the param-
eters needed to minimize the squares of the deviations were determined.

With new values for Qy2 Qs rs and. Sy the new values for x and y
were calculated. The least-square subroutine was repeated until the values
for Qo? Qs Tos and Ss, were essentially constant as indicated by their be-
ing changed less than a preset limit (usually 1%) in successive steps.

The method would not work when the initial guesses were not reasonably
close to the correct values. Upper and lower limits were preset for the
value of each parameter. If these limits were reached the calculation was
terminated and the data resubmitted with different first guesses.

The "best" values for the parameters Qys 9s Ts 8nd 5 are reported
in Teble 4. The indirect method for determining these values did not per-
mit calculation of the standard deviations of these parameters. Since a
large number of runs are reported for 0.333 BeF,, the spread in the Qq and
Qu values may be used as an indication of the uncertainties with which
these are known. The values for r, and Sy represent concentrations of
oxide and hydroxide at the start of an experiment, hence their variations
are mainly the result of differing histories of the melts. The runs are
arranged according to composition and temperature with run numbers given

for cross reference with the original data in Appendix B.
56

A measure of the goodness of fit is given in Table 5. The mean of
the calculated x curve is given with the standard deviation of the observed
values of x from the calculated values along with the number of observed
x points. The corresponding information is also given for y. This tabular
information does not give a complete picture of the correlation, hence the
following figures are included to further show the relationships. Each
figure consists of two plots: one showing the calculated values of x and
y as a function of W with the pressure data indicated by short bars, the
other showing the values of oxide and hydroxide (r and s) at the same val-
ues of W needed to obtain the calculated values of x and y for the parameters
specified on each.

Figures 6 through 12 are all for 0.333 BeFa. Figures 6 and 7 (Runs
303 and 305) show similar conditions (600°) except for the initisl oxide
concentration in the melt. Figure 8 (Run 306) shows the decrease in x and
y when the influent HF and HoO were stopped at the end of Run 305 and Hz
sparging continued. Figures 9 and 10 (Runs 307 and 313) are for 700 end
500°C, respectively. Figures 11 and 12 (Runs 501 and 511) show the behavior
during higher-temperature (650°¢) and lower-temperature (550°¢) removal of
oxide from the melt.

Figures 13 through 15 are for 0.273 BeFa. Addition of oxide is shown
in Figure 13 (Run 533) and removal of oxide is shown in Figures 14 and 15
(Runs 535 and 539). Figure 16 (Run 607) shows removal of oxide from 0.600
BeFz which is near the upper limit of this technique. Figure 17 (Run 621)

shows the addition of oxide to 0.400 BeFa.

Validity of Results

The general agreement between the calculated and observed effluent
partial pressures of HF and Hp0, in view of the variety of experimental
conditions, supports the method of measurement and indicates that the equi
libria assumed were correct and sufficient. Some specific examples which
support these equilibria are given below.

Saturated Melts

The first clearcut indication of the formation of hydroxide in mea-
surable amounts came from the variation of effluent pressures with respect
to volume of carrier gas. When a mixture of HF and Ha0 was introduced into
8 BeO-saturated melt containing little or no hydroxide, the effluent par-
tial pressures of HF and H20 (x and y) increased with the increase in
volume of gas passed in such a manner that x2 fy remained constant, while
x/y decreased. Since Q = x%r/y and Q = xs/y, the quantity x*/y would
be constant when r is constant (fixed by Be0 saturation) and x/y would
decrease as s increases.

The influent partial pressures of HF and Ha0 were varied and the
resulting Q's compared. Runs 101, 103, and 123 for 0.316 BeFa at 700°C
(with reported Q values of 2.18 x 1072, 2.47 x 1072, and 2.13 x 1072,
respectively) had influent pressures such that influent (Pyp)?/ (Py, 0)
were 4.36 x 1072, 4.46 x 1072, and 4.25 x 10™3, respectively. Runs 105,
107, 109, and 111 for 0.316 BeFz at 600°C (with reported Q values of
4.61 x 1073, 4.07 x 1073, 4.09 x 1073, and 4.69 x 10” 3, respectively)
also indicated that the observed Q's were independent of the influent
pressures, with influent (Pp) ®/ (Py, 0) values being 6.52 x 10™2, 2.28 x

1072, 5.54 x 1072, and 4.98 x 10” 2, respectively.
72

These runs include cases where the influent and effluent pressures
were nearly identical and also where quite a bit of HF was required to
react with oxide to form water and the reverse (HzO reacting with fluoride
to form HF). All three gave Q's in agreement. In the early runs, the
flow rate of carrier gas was varied from 50 to 150 ml/min and no variation
in the effluent pressures was observed.

The QU values determined using saturated melts were similarly found
to be independent of the ratios of HF and Hz0 in the influent stream. Also,
Q was shown to be independent of whether hydroxide was being added or re-
moved by the gas stream. For example, see the odd-even pairs 401-402,
405-406, and 407-408 in Table 3 for 0.300 BeFa at 652, 601 and 700°C,
respectively.

The proton balance between influent and effluent gas streams, after
the initial region where hydroxide was being formed, also attests to the
validity of the measurement.

After completion of the 200 series the melt was transferred from the
vessel through a sintered nickel filter and the material on the filter
examined by x-ray diffraction. The characteristic peaks for LiF-BeFp and
BeO were observed. There was no indication of compound formation between
BeO and the fluoride melt or of other constituents [such as 1120 or Be(OH)2].
Unsaturated Melts

In addition to the tests performed with saturated melts, the validity
of Q was checked by conducting experiments in which oxide was being added
and also when oxide was being removed. The former, more precise results,

and the latter were in reasonable agreement.
73

The total pressure of the reactive gases was varied by changing the
temperature of the saturator with no noticeable effect on the 2 and Qp

values.
74
IV. DISCUSSION

The measured equilibrium quotients, Q, Qu» and Qs were correlsted
with temperature and melt composition in terms of simple algebraic expres-
sions. In the case of Q, wherein K, = /opep,s the resulting correlation
can be used to derive a considerable amount of thermodynamic information
about the LiF-BeF, solutions and, by extrapolation, about pure BeF, liquid.
Combination of Q and Q can be used to obtain the concentration of oxide
at BeO saturation. The variation of Qp with melt composition and tempera-

ture reflects the stability of hydroxide in LiF-BeF; melts.
Correlation of Q

For each composition, the Q values were correlated according to the
equation log Q = slope(1/T) + constant. The Q's were weighted by an amount
inversely proportional to their variance since all measurements did not
follow the same parent distribution. The values of the parameters are
presented in Table 6.

Since one of the primary objectives was determination of thermodynamic
properties of BeFa(1), extrapolation of these data as a function of Xper,
to the pure liquid BeF, was desirable. For a given temperature,
log (Q/%pep,) vs (xp)?
forms a parabola for the composition range 0.30 to 0.80 BeFz, thus the Q
values at various compositions were correlated by the function
log (0/%p p,) =k + Lx 0? + mx, 0%

From definition in Chapter I, log KX, = k, therefore, correlation of k as
a function of 1/T will yield the thermodynamics of the desired reaction.

Both 1 and m also show linear dependence upon 1/T. For the coefficients
75

expressed according to k = k° + k'(1/T), etc.

© = 3.900 * 0.019 k' = 4418 + 17
1° = 7.819 % 0.225 1' = 5440 * 218
n° = -12.66 * 0.60 m' = 5262 * 513 .

From the above parameters, equations were generated for each experimental
composition as a function of (1/7). The smoothed parameters obtained are
tabulated in Table 7. The lines generated by the smoothed parameters for
the various experimental compositions are shown in Figure 18 along with
log K_ vs (1/T) for pure BeFz(1) based on the extrapolation. Figure 19

/Q is shown

provides a measure of this correlation. The quantity Q calc

obs
for each experimental run. The standard deviation for each point is rep-
resented by a vertical bar.
Activity of BeFz and LiF

Since Q is equal to K, (oper, )s
log (&/Xpep,) = log K (app )/(Xpop,) = log K, + log (app [Mpep,)
By definition, @BeF, is unity for pure liquid BeF; (Xper, = 1), therefore,
log (ager, /) = 0. ©Since Lip = 0 at this point,
log K, = k° + k'(1/T)
In order to solve for log (ager, Xper, which is log "Ber? at any com-

position the value of log K must be subtracted from log (Q/%Xg 5) leaving

The quoted uncertainties in ¢ and PB lead to an average uncertainty of

* 0.10 units in log 7. From these uncertainties the values 100°

BeF'
apart would overlap within the quoted uncertainty, but the values for
500 and 700°C definitely do not overlap.

According to the Gibbs-Duhem Equation, if the activity (or activity
coefficient) of one component is known as a function of composition, the
other can be determined by integration of the equation

Two methods for evaluating C for various temperatures were considered.
For a given temperature, if NaF is known for one composition, C can be

determined and, hence, NiF determined for all compositions. First,
77

YIiF was calculated from the reported composition at LiF liquidus at
various temperatures where asp £1 and VAT = 1% The values for
NAF at the various temperatures were determined from the published phase
diagram” which was presented in Chapter I. The second method involved

the use of the Q values for BeO=saturated melts in contact with solid LiF

to determine the XraF at saturation. (The measured Q's are tabulated in
Table 3 and the parameters for smoothed fit are given in Table 6.) The
equations for log Sher, as a function of composition and log pe Ts at

LiF saturation were solved simultaneously to obtain Xap With the con-
centration of LiF at apap = 1 known, Y4F could be evaluated. The following
values for C were obtained by the two methods.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

From Thoma's Phase Diagram From Solution of Equations
oS XpeFa "14F ¢ XBeFa "iF ¢
600 0.280 1.389 +0.083 0.281 1.391 +0.086
700 0.208 1.263 +0.283 0.256 1.344 +0+451

Agreement of values of C determined by both methods is very good at 500
and 600 but not at 700°C. Although IiF saturation at 700°C occurs at
0.208 BeFz, the value of C corresponding to a calculated saturation value
of 0.256 BeFz was considered more acceptable because the parabolic func-
tion does not fit the data well below 0.30 BeFz. In fact, at 0.25 BeFz
(data at 650 and 700°¢) the fit is very poor.

Other empirical expressions were tried in an attempt to improve the
fit in this region. No improvement was obtained using expressions con-
taining additional odd-powers of Lip? but a very good fit was obtained

from 0.25 to 0.50 BeFa by using an equation containing X?, X%, and X°
78

terms. Correlation of the data at 700°C gave the following equation:
log (@/Xpp,) = =0.723 + 4.094% = 16.64%%, + 12.51%% .

This equation should be compared with the correlation using only X? and
X* terms:

log (a/%y p,) = -0.640 + 2.229%% = 7.25%%

Both fit equally well between 0.33 and 0.50 BeFp, but the former fits
better for concentrations below 0.33 BeF; and the latter fits better for
concentrations above 0.50 BeFa. In order to obtain values for "BeFa from
the former equation, the constant term was adjusted to yield the same val-
ve of pep (at 0.40 BeF2) as was given by the simpler expression used to
express activities above 0.30 BeFa. The expression obtained for log "BeFa
was given by:

108 Tne, = -0.0382 + 4.0942 - 16.64%%  o + 12.51%5_.

If this equation is solved simultaneously with the equation for log Bper,
at LiF saturation, the concentration equals 0.208 BeF (the same as re-
ported by Thoma) and the value of C equals 1.124.
Figure 20 shows a plot of log "BeFa and log "iF as a function of
composition at 500, 600, and 700°C. The dashed lines indicate the values

at 700°C (below 0.30 BeFsz) when the equation with the x6 term was used.

LiF
(The overall fit was not improved by using the extra term, hence the sim-
pler form was used for the more general correlation.) The dotted line

indicates the values of log NaF at which the solid LiF phase would appear
79

and the values of log at which the pure liquid BeFz phase would

"BeF,
appear.

The (-*-+-) line shows the predicted behavior of log "BeF2 on the
basis of a simple model in which, for the region 0.33 - 1.0 BeFa, the
components are redefined as BeF, and LipBeF, and the activity of BeFz is

lated to Ker,’ the mole fraction in LiF-BeF2 mixtures, by

Since 88ers, =X BeF, as defined above, the activity coefficient of Bel;

assumed equal to the mole fraction X'

in IiF-BeF; mixtures is given by
Thera = (pep, = 10/255,

This procedure of redefining components is similar to the method of
Flood and Urnes; 0 however, the assumed proportionality of 8pe Fs, to its
mole fraction is purely arbitrary and the resulting correlation, vhich is
rather good, is, therefore, entirely empirical. It might be more reason-

able in this model to expect to be proportional to the product of

SBF,
the cation fraction of Be?" and the anion fraction of (F~) squared [i.e.,
* 1 3 . . .

8BeF, proportional to (x BeFs) 1, the melt being considered to be a simple
mixture of the four ions at, Be?” F, and BeF42~. In order to rationalize

. . 1 .
the proportionality of Spe, to X BeFa it seems necessary to adopt one of
the following unattractive models for the components
IipBeF; (undissociated) + BeFa (undissociated)
or
Ti22% BeF42™ + Be? BeF 2

A more realistic approach to an interpretation of the behavior of

2BeF, and asp can perhaps be made in terms of models such as have been
80

proposed by Férland.”t According to this model BeFa(1) is assumed to be
8 three-dimensional polymer of BeF4?~ tetrahedra with common corners, and
the addition of LiF is assumed to break the Be~F-Be bonds. However, no
such correlation will be attempted here.
Two features of the observed variation of ape, are especially note-
worthy:
(1) The rapid drop in Be» as X3ers approaches 0.33, at all temperatures,
suggests the formation of BeF42~ ion.

(2) The temperature coefficient of ¥ indicates increasing positive

BeF'2

deviations from Raoult's law with increasing temperature at high
Xpers, values.

The activities of BeFz and IiF were calculated from the activity
coefficients as a function of composition and temperature. The activities
at 500, 600, and 700°C are shown in Figure 21. The plot of activities,
which should be proportional to the partial pressures of BeFz and LiF,
corresponds to the predicted behavior of a system showing incomplete nmis-
cibility."" Since the positive deviations increase with temperature,
these data seem to indicate that the system has a lower consolute temper=-
ature near 700°C and 0.80 BeFo. Although the number of determinations of
Q in this area is not extensive enough to definitely show the formation
of two liquid phases, the indication is strong enough to warrant further
investigation of this possibility. To date there is no clearcut evidence
of partial immiscibility in the ILiF-BeFz system although various investi-
gators have considered the possibility of such oceurrence ooo The MgO-~
S5i02 system, which has frequently been compared with the LiF-BeF system,”

indeed does show a miscibility gap. At least one case has been reported
81

for a similar fluoride melt. At low IiF concentrations in the system,
LiF-BeF,-ZrFs, evidence was obtained from quenched samples that two immis-
cible liquids were formed above the ZrF,; primary phase field.”°

The TiF activity exhibits large positive deviations at low BeFp con-~
centrations; however, it should be kept in mind that these activities are
referred to the solid rather than the supercooled liquid (if the latter
were used as the reference state, all of the activities would be lower).
The activities reported in the present work are in general agreement with
previous measurements (summarized in Table 2). The largest discrepancy
is in the value for LiF at 0.50 BeF2 reported by Berkowitz and Chupka. 22
The value for LiF by Biichler?" is in reasonable agreement. Also, Bilichler
obtained greater activities for BeF; at higher temperatures .> Special
attention should be given to the value reported for 0.67 BeFz (displaying
very large positive deviations) which corresponds very closely to present
values. This agreement is particularly gratifying since three campletely
different techniques have been used to obtain the values. Also, the pre-
vious studies were performed with melts which did not have BeO present.
The presence of BeO would not be expected to affect the activities since
BeO is only slightly soluble. Beryllium oxide could not have affected
the Gibbs~Duhem integration since BeO was always present as a saturating
phase, thereby restricting its activity to unity.

The expression for the relative partial molal heat content is given
by:

Since the activity coefficient of BeFa2 is given by an analytical
expression, the excess chemical potential of BeF2 can be directly cal-
culated from

Since In "BeFa is a function of temperature, this equation does not lend
itself to easy tabular or graphic presention (unless in a plot similar
to Figure 20); however, the analytical expression should be useful for

further calculations involving the excess chemical potential.

Thermodynamics of BeFa2(1)

 

From the correlation of Q as a function of temperature and composition
for the reaction
BeF'2(1) + Ha0(g) == Beo(s) + 2HF(g)
involving pure liquid BeFa, the equation expressing equilibrium constant
values is
log K, = (3.900 * 0.019) - (4418 # 17)(1/T)
or
OF = -(17.85 + 0.09)T + (20,217 + 78) .

From this equation, the AH are 20.22 kcal/mole BeFa

reaction’ 2% reaction
and 17.85 eu/mole BeFa2, respectively. As indicated in Chapter I, the ther-
modynamic values of Ha0(g), HF(g), and BeO(s) are fairly well established.
Thus, by using these values and the relationships from the above reaction,
new values for 2F° 2H, 2s, and s° of BeF2(1) can be calculated. These

are tabulated below along with the reported values from JANAF.”

While the present values are not in close agreement with the published
values, they provide the most direct experimental method of evaluating the
thermodynamic properties of BeFa(l). If these values for BeFa(l) are com-
bined with the data of Greenbaum, et a1.10 for the vapor pressures of

BeFa2(1), new values for the thermodynsmics of BeFa(g) can be obtained.

These are tabulated below along with the values reported in JANAF.

The values of a, and s® of BeFa(g) reflect significant difference between
these results and those of Greenbaum, et al.’ for the reaction
BeO(s) + 2HF(g) == BeFa(g) + Ha20(g)
Since the values of aF°, from the two methods are in reasonable agreement,
the greatest source of difference must be in the temperature dependence of
the equilibrium quotients.

In addition to the thermodynamic properties of BeFa(l) and BeFa(g),
the present study provides a means of determining thermodynamic properties

of BeFa(s) through determination of the heat of fusion, AH If pure

fusion’

solid BeF2 separates upon cooling the LiF-BeFp system, the relation between

BpeT, and the freezing temperature T at a given concentration Xe, in the

liquid is given by

a(in 25er,) =d In (Xper, "Bers, = (oH /RT?) aT

fusion

Ir Mp sion

In (Kop, Tper,) = ~(Bpygs on/R)(L/T - 1/7°)

with TS as the melting point of pure Bela. The values of T for various

is independent of T, then

compositions X3eFs were tabulated from the published phase diagram.” The
values of "Bes were calculated for the specified temperatures and compo-
sitions from the derived expression given earlier. A plot of

log (Xpop, per, VS 1/T

is given in Figure 22. The slope of this correlation leads to a value
90

of 11 % 3 kcal/mole for Ha sion’ The other lines presented in the figure
include: the line obtained if AH = 1.6 kcal/mole; the line obtained

fusion

if Ber, = 1 (i.e., log Xoops VE 1/7); the line obtained if Mo ion =

7.5 kcal/mole.

The value of 1.6 kcal/mole for AH

fusion VS included for comparison

because this value was recently reported” from comparison of AH ‘th

subl wk

Map” Both measurements were from the variation of vapor pressures with
temperature over solid and liquid, respectively. One discrepancy in these
date, which is not mentioned in the article, is that the vapor pressures
reported for the solid near the melting point are greater than the extrap-
olated vapor pressures of the liquid by a factor of three. The fact that
the reported vapor pressures for the solid and liquid do not intersect even

near the melting point is indicative of a systematic error in one or the

other sets of measurements since both sets seem internally consistent.

The value of 7.5 kcal/mole for Ap sion was included for camparison
because this is the value obtained if Hp sion is determined to be the dif-

ference between gh of BeF2(1) calculated here and a, of BeFa(s) reported
in JANAF.* The I: of BeFa(s) is based on the heat of solution measure-
ments on BeO and BeFz in aqueous HF by Kolesov, et 21.7% Since there is
some question regarding the accuracy of the reported results, the value of

OH is about 7.5 * 6 kcal/mole. Although the present results do not

fusion

definitely establish the value of AH of BeFa(s), they do tend to sup-

fusion
port the value of 12 kcal/mole reported in JANAF rather than that of 2
kcal/mole used in the JANAF tabulation or the more recently reported value

of 1.6 kcal/mole.

Correlation of Qu

The values of Q, reported in Tebles 3 and 4 were correlated with

respect to temperature and composition. Visual inspection indicated that

the values exhibited linear dependence on both temperature and composition.

The general equation for the correlation was obtained in the following

manner:

(1)

(2)

(3)

The values at each temperature were grouped to determine the slope of
the line

log Q = (slope)Xy pr, + constant

The least-square slopes at the five experimental temperatures were as

 

follows:
Temp (°c) Slope No. of Values
500 2.695 £ 0.473 6
550 2.480 = 0.357 11
600 3.123 = 0.174 22
650 2.847 * 0.207 16
700 2.775 * 0.175 20

Using weights equal to the number of data points for each line, the
average slope was determined to be 2.843. All of the values agree
with this slope within the quoted standard deviations except the value
at 600° which is slightly larger.

With the slope of all lines set at 2.843, the value of log Q at the
composition intercept (Xper, = 0) was determined at each temperature

to give best fit to data as shown below:
93

 

 

Temp (°c) log Q Temp (°c) log Q
500 -3.138 650 -2.757
550 -3.056 700 -2.638
600 -2.893

(4) These end values were used to calculate the function of log Q, vs 1/7,
vhich is log Q, = -2085(1/T) - 0.503. Thus, the best smoothed values
for Q over the experimental range are given by
log Q, = 2.843%, 0 - 2085(1/1) ~ 0.503 .

The observed values of Q and the calculated values based on the above
function are shown in Figure 23. Since the data at the various temperatures
overlap, the coordinates are specified for each line independently. The
standard deviations of the points are not shown in the figure, but most
points agree within the quoted standard deviations in Table 3. The values
determined in BeO-saturated melts are shown by closed symbols and those in
unsaturated melts by open symbols.

The concentration of hydroxide present at equilibrium for known par-
tial pressures of HF and Hz0 above a melt of known composition could be
calculated using the relationship for Qp»

Q) = (Pyp/Pyg, 0) LOH) = mole/kg ,

derived from the reaction

H20(g) + F (soln) = HF(g) + OH (soln) .

Other equilibria involving hydroxide were also introduced in Chapter
I. One reaction is
H0(g) + 0*"(soln) == 20H (soln)
from which

Qp = [on™ 1%/Py 4 = (a,)%/a
9%

for a BeO-saturated melt. Since expressions for both Q and Qu are known,
the values of Q can be derived. If the equation given earlier for
log (@/%pep,) is rearranged in terms of XpeFs rather than ip the follow-
ing equation is obtained
log (Q/%pep,) = 0.940 - 4596(1/T) + [35.00 - 10168(1/T) Xp pp,

If this equation is combined with the expression for Qps the following
holds:

Another reaction involving hydroxide is

HF(g) + 027 (soln) == OH (soln) + F (soln)

from which

Qq = [oH Pep = Q,/Q for a BeO-saturated melt.

0.40 3609 ~4.052 0.80 2541 -2.348

If the above functions are used to evaluate equilibrium quotients
for 0.333 BeFa, the values obtained and AH based on integration of the

van't Hoff equation are given below:

Fach of these equilibrium quotients is in terms of moles of hydroxide per

kilogram of melt due to experimental expediency, but they could be converted
to the mole fraction scale by dividing each by moles of solvent per kilogram
of melt. This conversion would not affect the A values. The above values
of equilibrium quotients involving hydroxide may not provide enough informa-

tion to establish the complete nature of hydroxide in the LiF-BeF: system,
96

but they do allow quantitative prediction of the extent of conversion of
oxide to hydroxide, which is the principal controlling step in the removal

of oxide by HF-sparging.

Correlation of W

The values of reported in Table 4 were correlated as a function of
temperature at each composition. The parameters of the equation
log Q, = slope(1/T) + constant

are given below:

0.400 -9032 * 706 7.026 = 0.812 4

The values of Ro and the corresponding correlations as a function of
temperature are shown in Figure 24. Since the two values for 0.60 BeF:
would not yield a line with slope or intercept similar to the others, a
line was drawn parallel to the line at 0.40 BeFz so as to be equidistant
between the two values at 0.60 BeFa.

Measurement of Q at high BeFp compositions is limited because the
rate of change in P_., and P with respect to W approaches the precision

HF Ha0
of measurements of the low P and high Pip encountered. Although addi-

H20
tional experiments were performed on 0.60 BeFp, convergence in the solution
of equations to obtain Qo? Qs ros and 8, was not reached due to the exper-
imental limitation mentioned above.
The data on unsaturated melts were neither extensive nor precise
enough to permit a meaningful correlation with respect to melt composition.

However, the solubility of BeO could be determined by comparison of these

measurements with those of BeO-saturated melts.
99

As described in Chapter I,
Q = (By) 2[0*71/2y
and since for a BeO-saturated melt
(Py) 2/Pyp0 = @
[0%] ca, = Q/Q ’
The value of Q at BeO saturation was established in the earlier work. Divi-
sion of Qy by Q for the same melt composition and temperature would provide
the concentration of oxide at saturation.

The values of Q needed to determine BeO solubility are given by the
following parameters for the equation

log Q = slope(1/T) + constant:

Ber, Slope Constant

 

0.273 -5900 44150
0.333 -5674 44233
0.400 -5565 4.528
0.600 -5274 4a T45

The solubilities in moles per kilogram of oxide in the various experiments,
as determined from Qy/ using observed Q values and smoothed Q values
from the above relation, are given in Table 8. Since

[07] = q,/Q

log [027] = log Q - log Q ,

and as both log Q and log Q show linear dependence with (1/1), log [027]
should also show linear dependence. Combination of the parameters for Q
and Q leads to

log [027] = slope(1/T) + constant:
100

 

per, Slope Constant
0.273 -2258 0.641
0.333 -2963 1.440
0.400 -3467 2.498

Each of the observed solubilities is shown in Figure 25 along with the
calculated expressions for the three compositions tabulated above.

Since many more experiments were performed on 0.333 BeF2, the range
of measured solubilities at each temperature provides a rough measure of
just how well these are known. A clear trend of solubility with tempera-

ture is shown:

500°C (2.5 = 6.0) x 10~3 moles/kg
600 (7.2 - 11.8) x 103
700 (2.3 - 3.8) x 10°%

The other values indicate that BeO solubility may be increasing slightly

with BeFaz, but the increase is not very great.

Melt Compositions.

Summary

These studies of equilibria between HF, H20, and molten LiF-BeFz had
a twofold purpose: (1) to determine as much as possible about the thermo-
dynamics of the IiF-BeF, system, and (2) to determine as much as possible
about the oxide chemistry of the system.

The thermodynamic activities of LiF and BeF2 were determined as a
function of temperature and composition. The major characteristics of
the system include:

(1) Positive deviations from ideality at high BeF, concentrations.

(2) Increasing positive deviations of the activity with temperature indi-
cating the probability of a miscibility gap near 700°C.

(3) combination of activities with previously published phase diagram
indicate a higher value for AH sion of BeF2 than currently used in
thermodynamic compilations.

(4) Activities determined with BeO present are in agreement with limited
previous data.

Extrapolation of data to pure liquid BeF,, which is inaccessible
experimentally because of high viscosity, provides a means of determining
thermodynamic properties of BeFa(l).

The equilibria between Hz0, HF, and dissolved hydroxide were studied
by estimating, from material balance calculations on the gas phase, the
amount of OH formed in or removed from the melt upon reaction. The re-
sults from measurements on both BeO~saturated and unsaturated melts were
consistent. The results indicate that significant amounts of hydroxide
were formed in the presence of 0.01 atm HF, but OH could not exist in

the absence of HF and Hz0.
105

The equilibria between H20, HF, and dissolved oxide were also evalu-
ated with melts not saturated with BeO. The solubility of BeO was estimated
by combination of these results with those for BeO-saturated melts.

These results suggest methods to attack at least two allied problems:
(1) Determination of thermodynamic activities of other fluorides dissolved

in the LiF-BeF, system; and
(2) Determination of the amount of oxide in fluoride melts.

The procedure used here to determine activities of BeO~saturated melts
could be applied to melts saturated with other sparingly soluble oxides.
Variation in Q with amount of corresponding fluoride dissolved in melt would
provide information necessary to calculate change in activities.

The experiments performed here on unsaturated melts required determi~-
nation of the concentration of oxide present at the start of an experiment
in addition to the equilibrium quotients. If oxide analyses were required
on similar melts, the equilibrium quotients could be evaluated and treated
as fixed parameters, thus the variation in effluent Pup and. Pro to a small
value of W (about 1.0) could be used to calculate the amount of oxide in
the sample prior to treatment. In principle, this should work no matter
whether oxide were being added or removed. The presence of saturating
solid oxide would complicate the analysis, but the total amount of oxide
present could be determined by treatment with anhydrous HF and measurement

of the evolved HzO.

APPENDIX A

Partial Pressures from Studies on BeO=Saturated Melts

The experiments are arranged according to a three digit "Run No."
which indicates chronological order. There are three series (100, 200,
400) included. A brief history of each series is given in Chapter III.

The information provided for each experiment includes:

Run No.
Composition of melt (expressed as mole fraction BeF2)

Temperature of melt, °c

n

w = weight of melt, kg

T = temperature of wet-test meter, °k

a = influent Po, atm x 103
= 4 3
c¢ = influent Pu,0? atm x 10
The effluent partial pressures, Pup = x and Pr,0 = y, are tabulated (atm

x 103) with the corresponding initial and final values of W (V/wRT). Note
that the use of W allows consistent comparison of experiments independent
of the weight of melt or temperature of gas-measurement. The equilibrium

quotients evaluated from each experiment are presented in Table 3.

APPENDIX B
Partial Pressures from Studies on Unsaturated (with respect
to Be0) Melts
The experiments are arranged according to a three digit "Run No."
which indicates chronological order. There are three series (300, 500,
600) included. A brief history of each series is given in Chapter III.
The information provided for each experiment includes:
Run No.
Composition of melt (expressed as mole fraction BeFz)
Temperature of melt, °C

w = weight of melt, kg

T = temperature of wet-test meter, ox

a + bi = influent Pir, atm x 103

¢ + dW = influent Py, atm x 103

The effluent partial pressures, Par = x and PH0 = y, are tabulated (atm
x 103) with the corresponding initial and final values of W. Note that

the use of W allows consistent comparison of experiments independent of

the weight of melt or temperature of gas-measurement. The equilibrium

quotients evaluated from each experiment are presented in Table 4.
