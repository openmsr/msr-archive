J. R. Engel, P. N. Haubenreich and B. E. Prince

ABSTRACT

The alpha-n source inherent in the fuel salt meets
all the safety requirements for a neutron source in the
MSRE.

Subcritical flux distributions were calculated to
determine the combination of external source strength and
detector sensitivity required for monitoring the reactivity.
If more sensitive detectors than the servo-driven fission
chambers are installed in the instrument shaft to monitor
the filling operation, the calculations indicate that the
required source strength can be reduced from 4 x 107 n/sec
to 7 x 10% n/sec. An antimony-beryllium source with an
initial strength of 4 x 108 n/sec would still produce
7 x 108 n/sec one year after installation.

Because there is considerable uncertainty in the
calculated fluxes, the final specification of source and
type should be made after preliminary flux measurements
have been made in the reactor.

 

IMWLRODUCTION

Some source of neutrons that is independent of the fission chain
reaction is essential to the safe and orderly operation of the MSRE.

The primary requirement for such a source is to insure that when-
ever the reactor is subcritical, the neutron population in the reactor
is still high enough that in any conceivable reactivity excursion the
inherent shutdown mechanisms and the action of the safety system become
effective in time to prevent damaging power and temperature excursions.

Besides the safety requirements for a source, there is another,
related to the convenient and orderly operation of the reactor. This
is that the neutron flux at the detectors be high enough that the
fission chain reaction in the core can be monitored at all times. The

source strength required for this purpose depends on the experiment
being conducted or the condition of the reactor and the location and
sensitivity of the detectors.

This report describes the conditions that will exist in the MSRE
during the initial critical experiment and during subsequent startups,
both before and after extended operation at power. The source regquire-
ments for the various conditions are described and the extent to which
these are satisfied by the inherent, internal sources is discussed.

The requirements for an external source to supplement the inherent
source are analyzed and recommendations are made for an external
source and mode of startup operation that satisfy the requirements

in a reasonable fashion.

INTERNAL SOURCE

The fuel salt itself provides a substantial source of neutrons
in this reactor.l In the clean fuel the largest contribution to the
internal source is from the alpha-n reactions of uranium alpha
particles with the fluorine and beryllium in the salt. Neutrons from
spontaneous fission of the uranium add to the internal source but this
contribution is much smaller than the alpha-n contribution.

The uranium in the fuel salt is a mixture of four isotopes,
yesh, Ue, ue36, and ye38, the proportions depend on the choice of
fuel to be used in the reactor. Table 1 gives the compositions of
three mixtures that have been considered, along with the isotopic
composition of the uranium in each. All of the uranium isotopes
undergo alpha decay and any of the uranium alphas can interact with
the fluorine and beryllium in the salt to produce neutrons. The
more energetic of the alpha particles can also produce neu-
trons by interaction with lithium, but the yield is neglegible in
comparison with that from fluorine and beryllium. Table 2 gives

the neutron source in the core due to the various uranium isotopes

for the clean, critical loading with the three different fuels.
About 97% of the alpha-n neutrons are produced by alpha particles
from URS4, thus, this source is proportional to the amount of Rae
in the fuel.

The most active of the available uranium isotopes from the
standpoint of spontaneous fission is 7238. As a result, Fuel C,
which contains a much larger proportion of 0222 than the other two
mixtures, has a substantially larger source of neutrons from
spontaneous fission. The inherent neutron source from spontaneous
fission is listed in Table 2 for each of the three fuel salt mixtures.

The MSRE will operate first with Fuel C, and the initial critical
experiment will consist of adding fully enriched uranium to a salt
already containing depleted uranium to bring the composition up to
that shown in Table 1. At the beginning of the critical experiment
the salt will contain 97% of the UPS but only about 0.5% of the U3*
and USS in the critical loading. The combined alpha-n and spontaneous
fission source in the core at this point will be about 2 x 10° n/sec.

After the MSRE has been operated at high power, the fuel will
produce a significant number of photoneutrons from the interaction of
fission-product decay gammas with beryllium. The threshold photon
energy for this source is 1.67 Mev, so this type of source is
insignificant before operation when only the uranium decay gammas
are present. Since the concentrations of fission products and
beryllium do not vary widely with the choice of fuel, the photoneutron
source is approximately the same for all three fuels. Figures 1 and 2
show the rate of photoneutron production in the M3SRE core after operation
at 10 Mw for periods of 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month. The source is
proportional to the power, and the source after periods of non-uniform
power operation can be estimated by superposition of sources produced

by equivalent blocks of steady-power operation.

used,” and the total cross section was evaluated at 2 Mev. These assump-

tions lead to a conservatively low estimate of neutron source strength.

PROVISION FOR EXTERNAT. SOURCE

For reasons which will be discussed later, it is desirable to supple-
ment the inherent internal source with a removable source. Therefore a
thimble is provided in the thermal shield, on the opposite side of the
reactor from the nuclear instrument shaft. The thimble is a 1-1/2 inch,
sch. 40 pipe of 304 stainless steel, extending vertically down to about
2 ft below the midplane of the core. It is mounted as close as possible
to the inner surface of the thermal shield for maximum effectiveness.
Location of the source thimble in the thermal shield provides water cooling

and avoids the high temperatures associated with the reactor.

NEUTRON DETECTORS

All the permanently-installed core- neutron detecting instruments are
located in the nuclear instrument shaft. This is a water-filled, 3 ft-
diameter tube which slopes down to the inner surface of the thermal shield
with separate inner tubes for the various chambers. Among the permanent
instruments in this tube are two servo-positioned fission chambers which
will be used to monitor routine startups as well as to record the entire

power range of the reactor. These chambers are about 1 in. in diameter

by 6 in. long and have a rather low counting efficiency of 0.026 counts
per newtron fort. (Other chambers in the tube which have no bearing on
the source requirement are 2 compensated ion chambers and 3 uncompensated
safety chambers.)

Two vertical thimbles, similar to the source thimble but made of
2 in. sch. 10 pipe, are installed in the thermal shield to accomodate
temporary detectors. The two detector thimbles are located 120° and 150°
from the source thimble, one on either side of the permanent nuclear
instrument shaft. The advantage of these vertical thimbles is that they
place the entire length of a chamber close to the inner surface of the
thermal shield, whereas a long chamber in the sloping instrument shaft
would extend back into a lower -flux region and thus be exposed to a
lower average flux.

In addition to these provisions, there are spare tubes in the nuclear

instrument shaft which could accomodate additional detectors.

PLUX II SURCRITICAT. REACTOR

In planning the use of source and detectors in reactor experiments
and operation, an important quantity is the ratio of counting rate to
source strength under various conditions. The counting rate is the pro-
duct of the counting efficiency of the chamber and the average flux to
which the chamber is exposed. The flux at the chamber depends on the
source—its strength, the energy of its neutrons, and, in the case of
an external source, its location. The flux also depends on the amount
of multiplication by fissions and the shape of the neutron flux distri-
bution in the core, which is determined by the location of the source
and the value of k in the core.

The flux distributions in and around the reactor have been calculated
for several different cases to provide a basis for planning for the source
and detectors. Many approximations had to be made to render the computa-
tions manageable and consequently the probable error in the results is
quite large, perhaps as much as a factor of ten. Unless specifically
stated otherwise, the fluxes and source strength requirements described

in this report do not contain any allowance for probable error.
Flux Due to Internal Source

 

With an internal, distributed source of Sin n/sec in the core, the
steady-state production rate will be approximately s,./(1 — kee) n/sec.
The flux at any point is then

f. 5;
in "in

¢ (1 - Err)
The factor fn for a given location depends on the shape of the flux. For
a flat source and low multiplication, fi at an external detector would be
somewhat higher than at high multiplication, when neutrons are, on the
average, produced nearer to the center of the core.

When the multiplication is high, i.e., when (1 - koe) is quite small,
most of the neutrons are produced by fissions in the core, with a spatial
source distribution close to the fission distribution in a critical reactor.
The relation between the core power, or fission rate, in the critical core
and the flux in the thermal shield was calculated in the course of the
thermal shield design, using DSN, * a multigroup, transport-theory code.

For the case of a thick, water-filled thermal shield, when the core power
is 10 Mw, the predicted thermal neutron flux reaches a peak, 1 inch inside
the water, of 1.2 x 102 n/em®-sec. The ratio of peak flux to power is
thus 1.2 x 10° n/cm®-sec per watt, or 1.5 x 1078 n/cm®-sec per n/sec pro-
duced in the core. It was estimated that a chamber, 6 in. long, at maximum
insertion in the instrument shaft would be exposed to an average flux of
roughly 1 x 1077 n/cnf -sec per n/sec produced. A chamber 26 in. long in
the instrument shaft would see an average flux only a third as high because
the shaft slopes away from the core. The flux in one of the vertical
thimbles near the inner wall of the thermal shield would be about 3 x 1077
n/cm®-sec per n/sec produced. Thus as Lo apprecaches unity, fin approaches
1x 1077, 3 x 107 and 3 x 1077 em™® for a 6-in. chamber in the shaft, a

26-in chamber in the shaft and any chamber in a thimble, respectively.

Flux Due to External Source

 

If a large fraction of the neutrons come from an external source, the
flux shape will differ markedly from the critical shape. Flux distributions
in the subcritical reactor with a strong external source were computed by
a two-group neutron diffusion method. Eguipoise Burnout, > a two-group,
two-dimensional diffusion-theory program was used. The reactor was rep-
resented by a model in which the cross section of the reactor and thermal
shield at the midplane of the core was approximated in x-y geometry and
the axial leakage was represented by an equivalent buckling. In order
to make the annular gap between the reactor and thermal shield manageable
by the diffusion program, the materials in the gap (electric heaters,
heater thimbles, insulation, and insulation cladding) were uniformly
dispersed in it. The source was represented by a localized neutron-
producing region just inside the thermal shield.® Two-group fluxes were
calculated by this method for two cases —— with no fuel salt in the core
and with the core filled with salt containing enough 035 to give a k,

of 0.91 (about 0.76 of the critical concentration).

ff

Although the neutron detectors respond primarily to thermal neutrons,
it is enlightening to look at the fast neutron distributions because most
of the thermal neutrons reach the vicinity of the detector as fast neutrons
and are slowed down locally. Figure 3 shows the fast flux (normalized to
one neutron from the external source) at the core midplane along a diameter
which intercepts the locations of the neutron source and the fission
chambers. With no fuel in the reactor, the fast flux was higher in the
gap between the reactor and thermal shield, on the opposite side of the
reactor from the source, than in either of the immediately adjacent
regions. This implies that, under these conditions, most of the fast
neutrons that reached the vicinity of the fission chambers arrived by way

of the annular gap and that very few were transmitted through the core.

The addition of fuel to the core increased the fast neutron source by
adding fission neutrons and leakage of some of these neutrons from the
core raised the fast flux near the fission chambers by a factor of 3.
The fast fluxes on the source side of the reactor vessel were not af-
fected by the addition of fuel at this concentration. (It was assumed
that the external source was strong enough that internal non-fission
sources were negligible in comparison).

Figures 4 and 5 show parts of several thermal flux contours at the
core midplane with no fuel salt in the reactor (Fig. 4) and with salt
containing 0.76 of the critical UP®® concentration (Fig. 5). The contour
lines are superimposed on scaled drawings of the reactor model used in
the calculations and the relative positions of the external source and
the neutron detectors are indicated.

Table 3 gives the ratio of the thermal neutron flux at a chamber to
the external source strength. In the cases of the 120° and 150° vertical
thimble locations the flux is that at the center of the thimble. For the
tubes in the instrument shaft, which slope away from the reactor, the
average flux seen by a chamber depends on its length.

Comparison of the two figures and the numbers in the table shows
guite clearly that the thermal neutron flux in the gap and in the thermal
shield, for a considerable distance from the source, is highly insensitive
to conditions in the core. As a result the counting rate of a chamber
in the 120° thimble is a much poorer indication of changes in the core

than 1s the counting rate of a chamber in the instrument shaft.

Effect of Kore on Flux

 

An approximate relation between the flux, or counting rate, and k op

can be obtained by interpolation of the results calculated for Lo of
0, 0.91 and 1.0.

SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

When excess reactivity is added to a reactor which is initially
operating at a very low power, the fission rate must increase by several
orders of magnitude before the inherent shutdown mechanism of the negative
temperature coefficient of reactivity becomes effective or a rod drop is
initiated by the high-level safety circuits. (There is no period scram
on the MSRE.) Since this power increase takes some time, a substantial
amount of excess reactivity may be added by a continuing reactivity ramp
and the power may be increasing with a very short period by the time the
various shutdown mechanisms begin to act. In the so-called "startup
accident” so much excess reactivity is added that severe power and temper-
ature transients may be produced despite the action of the shutdown
mechanisms.

In such accidents, provided the fission rate follows the behavior
predicted by the nuclear kinetics equations, the severity of the tempera-
ture excursion is uniquely determined by the rate of reactivity increase,
the characteristics of the inherent and mechanical shutdown mechanisms,
and the initial power (the mean value of the initial fission rate). If,
however, the initial fission rate is extremely low, statistical fluctua-
tions about the mean may permit wide variations in the amount of excess

reactivity which can be introduced before the power reaches a significant
17

level. The problem is described by Hurwitz et al. in a recent paper’ as
follows. "When a reactor is started up with an extremely weak source,
there will be an initial period of time during which the power level 1s
so low that statistical fluctuations are important. Eventually the power
level will rise to a sufficiently high level so that further statistical
fluctuations have negligible effect. The influence of the statistical
fiuctuations in the early stage of the startup will, however, persist
through the high level stage in the sense that the early statistical
fluctuations determine the initial conditions for the high level stage."
In the case of the MSRE, the inherent alpha-n source produces more than
10° neutrons/sec in the core whenever the uranium required for criticality
is present, and the fission rate is already in the high level stage
(statistical fluctuations unimportant) at the outset of any startup
accident. Furthermore, kinetics calculations have shown that the initial
fission rate sustained by the inherent alpha-n source is high enough to
make tolerable the worst credible startup accident, which is described in
the following paragraphs.

The maximum rate of reactivity addition that can be achieved in the
MSRE results from the uncontrolled, simultaneous withdrawal cf all three
control rods. The rate of reactivity addition depends on the type of
fuel in the reactor (which determines the control-rod worth) and the
position of the rods with respect to the differential-worth curve. The
most severe rod-withdrawal accident involves fuel C and the maximum rate
of reactivity addition is 0.08% 6k/k per sec. (A higher reactivity ad-
dition rate, 0.10% per sec, can be obtained with fuel B, but this mixture
also has a larger negative temperature coefficient of reactivity so the
resultant power excursion is less severe.)

For shutdown margins greater than 2% ok/k and reactivity ramps between
0.05 and 0.1% per sec, the power level of the reactor when k = 1 is about
2 milliwatts if only the inherent alpha-n source (L x 10° n/sec) 1s present.
Figure 6 shows the power and temperature excursions that result with fuel

C when all three control rods are moving in the region of maximum

differential worth when k = 1 for this condition. In this calculation
the nuclear power reached 15 Mw (the level at which the reactor safety
curcuits initiate corrective action) 7.5 sec after criticality was
achieved. At that time 0.6% excess reactivity had been added and, since
the nuclear average temperature of the fuel (Tp) had risen less than
2°F, almost none had been compensated by the temperature coefficient;
the reactor period was 0.1 sec. In the absence of action by the safety
system, intolerably high fuel temperatures would be produced by this
accident, not as a result of the initial excursion but as a result of
the continued rapid rod withdrawal afterwards.

Figure 7 shows the results of a calculation of the same accident
in which two of the three control rods were dropped (with a O.l-sec delay
time and an acceleration of 5 ft/sec)? when the power reached 15 Mw.

The temperatures reached in this case would cause no damage. Thus the
inherent alpha-n neutron source is adequate from the standpoint of
reactor safety.

Because the startup accident is safely limited with only the inherent
source in the reactor, it is not a safety requirement that any additional
source be present during startup. Nor is 1t necessary for safety that
instrumentation capable of "seeing" the inherent source be installed,

because its presence is certain and does not have to be confirmed before

each startup.

INITIAL STARTUP EXPERIMENTS

Although it is not a safety requirement, the presence of a source-
detector combination which permits monitoring of the fission rate in the
subcritical core is necessary for convenient and orderly experimentation

and operation.

based on tests with a prototype assembly.

More subcritical observations will be made during the initial nuclear
startup experiments than at any other time. For these experiments it was
expected that temporary neutron counting channels would be set up, using
sensitive detectors. The thimbles in the thermal shield were included
for this purpose, to obtain a higher average flux at the chambers than
could be obtained in the nuclear instrument shaft and also to provide
for installation of detectors at more than one location.

The vertical thimbles will accomodate 30-in-long BF3 chambers, with
a counting efficiency of 14 counts per n/cm=. Even with these sensitive
chambers, the inherent source in the salt (containing only the depleted
uranium) before the addition of the enriched uranium is inadequate to
give a significant count rate. Because it is desirable to have a refer-
ence count rate at practically zero multiplication, an extraneous source
is required for the critical experiment. Furthermore, in the determination
of the critical point and possibly in the calibration of the control rods,
it is convenient to be able to remove the major neutron source and observe
the decay of the flux. For these reasons, a removable external source
should be provided for these experiments.

The flux at the various chamber locations, from an external source,

at any value of Lo can be estimated from Eq. 2 and the factors in

Table 4. The internal source strength increases linearly with the
amount of enriched uranium in the core, reaching about 4 x 10° n/sec

at the clean critical concentration. The flux from this source can also
be estimated from Eg. 2 and Table 4. The predicted variation of Kore
with enriched U concentration is necessary for this calculation, and this
relation is shown in Fig. 8.

The method of attaining the critical concentration will be to add
increments whose sizes are determined by a plot of inverse count rate vs
amount of enriched uranium already added. Fig. 9 is such a plot, generated
from the flux calculations described above and the k vs C relationship
from Fig. 8. Neutrons from both the internal source and an external
source of 10° n sec are included.

The bowing of the curves in Fig. 9 reflects the contribution of
neutrons which are scattered around the outside of the reactor from the

source to the detectors. As would be expected, the error is largest for

the detector located nearest the source. Because the bowing makes ex-
trapolation less accurate, the instrument shaft is the most suitable
location for detectors in the approach to critical. Therefore the ex-
ternal source for the critical experiment should be at least strong

enough to give a conveniently high count rate at a chamber in the instru-
ment shaft before any enriched uranium is added. A source of 1 x 108 n/sec
would give a count rate of 10 c/sec on a chamber with a counting effi-
ciency of 1h c/sec/n/cn® -sec under these conditions.

The strength requirement just stated is a minimum for starting the
critical experiment. The initial approach to criticality will include
experimental determinations of control-rod worth and concentration coef-
ficient of reactivity. These determinations are based on count-rate
measurements with and without the external source present. Therefore,
it must be possible to obtain a substantial difference in count rate by
removing the external source. Since the internal, alpha-n source in-
creases in intensity with increasing uranium concentration, the external
source must be strong enough to make the contribution from the internal
source small by comparison when the uranium concentration is near the
critical value. The flux calculations indicate that an external source
of 1 x 107 n/sec would produce a flux in the instrument shaft at least
100 times that from the internal source at all points during the approach
to critical. The differences in count rate which can be obtained with
a source of this strength are illustrated in Fig. 10. This figure shows
the reciprocals of the count rates predicted for a BF3 chamber (counting
efficiency of 14) in the instrument shaft as the critical point is ap-
proached. The two curves are for the internal source alone (external
source withdrawn) and with both the internal source and the external

source.

NORMAL OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

An external source of neutrons is required during normal operation
of the reactor to permit the convenient monitoring of the reactivity
during routine startups. (The safety requirements for a source are

satisfied by the inherent alpha-n source. )

Partial and Complete Shutdown and Startup

There are two degrees of normal shutdown in the MSRE — partial and
complete. In a partial shutdown, the fission chain reaction is shut-
down by inserting the control rods to take the reactor subcritical, while
the fuel salt continues to circulate at the normal operating temperature.
(Electric heaters maintain the temperature. ) The reactivity shutdown
margin is between 2 and 5% ok/k, depending mainly on the amount of xenon
in the core. Such partial shutdowns will occur frequently during experi-
mental operation of the reactor. Less frequently, the reactor will be
completely shutdown by inserting the rods and draining the fuel from the
core into a drain tank.

A startup from a completely shutdown condition will involve two
stages, and the source and detector requirements are different for the
two stages. The first stage involves preheating, filling the core, and
beginning circulation. The second (which is the only step in starting
up from a partial shutdown) involves withdrawing the control rods to take

the reactor critical and on up to the desired power level.

Second Stage Startup Requirement

For the second stage, it is desirable that one instrument follow the
flux continuously, from the beginning of rod withdrawal until the reactor
is operating at full power. The servo-driven fission chambers serve this
purpose. Therefore the external source should at least be strong enough
to give a significant count rate on the fission chambers when the core
is full of salt but subcritical by the maximum margin attainable with the
control rods (5% 6k/k). A control interlock requires that one of the
fission chambers have a count rate of 2 c/sec before the rods can be
withdrawn in this stage of the operation. The calculated flux distri-
butions indicate that to obtain the required count rate on the fission
chambers, an external source of at least 7 x 10° n/sec is required. An
internal source of 4 x 107 n/sec in the core would also clear the inter-
lock and permit rod withdrawal. As shown in Fig. 2, the fission products
would produce photoneutrons at a rate greater than this for several weeks

after a few days' operation at 10 Mw.
27

First Stage Startup Requirements

In the first stage, the reactivity must be monitored from the time
fuel begins to enter the core until the core is completely filled. Before
a fill can begin it is required that the rods be withdrawn to such a

position that k, will reach about 0.98 when the core becomes full. This

procedure o1love abnormalities to be detected, while retaining some re-
activity control which is instantly available by dropping the rods. To
insure that the monitoring system of source and detectors is operative,
there are two control interlocks which require a count rate of at least

2 c/sec. One is on rod withdrawel and the other is on drain tank pres-
surization. An external source of L x 107 n/sec would be necessary to
give 2 c/sec on the fission chambers with no fuel in the core, according
to the flux calculations. Note that this is over five times the source
strength required for the second stage. If BFs chambers with an active
length of 26 in. and a counting efficiency of 1h (c/sec)/(n/cn®-sec) are
used in the instrument shaft, a count rate of 2 c/sec with no fuel in the
core would be produced by an external source of only 2 x 10° n/sec. (The
factor by which the required source strength is reduced is less than the
ratio of counting efficiencies because the longer BFa chambers are exposed
to a lower average flux.)

Use of the BFs chambers to monitor the filling operation would re-
quire some changes in the reactor control circuits. The operational
interlock on control-rod withdrawal prior to filling could be bypassed
by an interlock which permits rod withdrawal if all (or most) of the fuel
salt is in the drain tank (as indicated by drain-tank weight, for instance).
This would allow withdrawal of the rods to start the fill but would pro-
hibit further withdrawal with the reactor even partly full unless the
fission chambers were indicating reliably. The count-rate confidence
interlock which must be satisfied before helium can be admitted to the
drain tank to start the fill could be based on a signal from the channels

served by the BFs chambers.
28

Limiting Requirement on Source Strength

 

If the more sensitive chambers are used in place of the servo-driven
fission chambers for monitoring the fill, the limiting requirement on
the external source is set by the second stage interlock on rod with-
drawal at 7 x 10° n/sec.

Because the second-stage rod-withdrawal interlock 1s encountered
after the fuel is in the core, the presence of an internal source strong
enough to clear the interlock would eliminate this particular requirement
for an external source. Thus for many startups after high power operation
it would be possible fo depend on the fission-product photoneutrons to
clear the rod-withdrawal interlock and the external source requirement

would be set by the first-stage, filling interlocck.

Other Considerations

 

Because the MSRE 1s expected to operate for several years, several
factors must be considered in the choice of an external source.

An antimony-beryllium source has the advantages of low initial cost,
ready availability in strengths well above 108 n/sec (irradiated in the
LITR) and freedom from the hazards of accidental release of alpha activity.
The most serious drawback is its short half-life. There is no significant
regeneration of Sb'?* in the low neutron flux at the source tube, so the
initial strength must allow for the decay of the source with a 60-day
half-life. Even so it will be necessary to replace the source periodically
throughout the life of the reactor. For example, in order to have
7 x 10° n/sec after 12 months decay, an Sb-Be source with an initial
strength of 4 x 108 n/sec would be necessary. Although Sb-Be sources
even stronger than this can be produced in the LITR, it is probably
more economical to use a pair of smaller sources which are alternately
used in the MSRE and regenerated in the LITR.

The decay of the source is not a problem if a plutonium-beryllium
source (24,000 year half-life) is used. Standard Pu-Be sources which

Puy=39

are obtainable contain from 1 to 10 curies of and produce from

1.6 x 10% to 1.6 x 107 n/sec. (The largest sources are too big to fit
29

into the MSRE source tube, however.) Although the problem of source

decay is avoided, the Pu-Be source has several disadvantages. The initial
cost is high and plutonium containment must be guaranteed at all times.
Also, the heat generation by fission in the plutonium (about 10 kw at a
reactor power of 10 Mw) would probably require that the source be re-

tracted during high-power operation.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Install in the spare tubes in the instrument shaft two additional
neutron chambers with a much higher counting efficiency than the servo-
driven fission chambers. Use these during the initial critical experi-
ments and for monitoring the filling stage of routine startups. Change
the interlock requiring a dependable count rate prior to filling from the
servo-driven-fission chambers to these chambers.

2. As soon as the installation of the reactor and equipment permits,
check the flux/source ratio calculated for the core with no fuel. (This
will greatly reduce the uncertainty in the source strength requirements. )
Any source of 108 n/sec or more will serve for this preliminary experiment.

3. Procure or manufacture a source which will meet the operational
requirements. The choice of the source type and its strength must be
based on the observed flux/source strength ratio and the considerations
described in the preceding section. If the actual flux/source ratio is
near that calculated, the choice for a source would be either a 5-curie
Pu-Be source (8 x 10% n/sec) or a pair of Sb-Be sources which would pro-
duce 3 to 5 x 108 n/sec (from about 125 curies of Spl) after an 8-week
irradiation in the LITR. After one Sb-Be source had been in the MSRE for
about 10 months, the other would be placed in the LITR for irradiation to
be ready for exchange when required. If the Sb-Be sources are used, it
will be desirable to modify the existing provisicns for source insertion
and removal to make the operation less time-consuming and costly. Speci-
fically, an access port should be provided through the steel cell cover

and the lower shield plug directly over the source tube.

APPENDIX

CALCULATION OF FLUX FROM AN EXTERNAL SOURCE

The neutron source for the MSRE will be installed in a thimble in
the thermal shield, about 20 in. from the outside of the reactor vessel.
The various neutron detectors will also be, in effect, in the thermal
shield at different circumferential positions. This results in a
highly unsymmetrical cylindrical geometry for conditions in which neutrons
from the source contribute substantially to the neutron flux. The source
is also short, compared to the height of the reactor, so an accurate cal-
culation of the flux at the detectors resulting from the source would
require the use of 3-dimensional, cylindrical (r, eo, z) geometry.

Since there is no reactor program available for treating this problem,
a number of approximations were made to reduce the problem to one which

could be handled with existing programs.

Geometric Approximations

 

The program used for the flux calculations was the Equipoise Burn-
out Code, a 2-group, 2-dimension neutron diffusion calculation with pro-
visions for criticality search. This code uses rectangular (X-Y) geometry
and is limited to 1600 mesh points.

In order to treat the azimuthal non-symmetry, the calculations were
made in a horizontal plane through the reactor and thermal shield at
the midplane of the core. The axial dimension of the reactor was
represented by a constant geometric buckling in that direction. Per-
turbations caused by the neutron detectors were neglected, so the plane
of the calculation had an axis of symmetry along the diameter which
intercepts the positions of the source and the fission chambers. There-
fore, it was necessary to describe only one-half of the plane in the
mathematical model. The limitation to X-Y geometry required that the
various regions be represented as collections of rectangles. The
main portion of the core was made equal in cross-sectional area to the

actual core with the transverse dimensions equal to core radii. These
21

two requirements determined the size of the "cutouts" at the corners
of the otherwise square core. The regions surrounding the core (i.e.
the peripheral regions of the reactor, the gap between the reactor and
thermal shield, and the thermal shield) were assigned transverse
dimensions equal to the radial dimensions of the actual components.
Figure 11 is a diagram of the resultant model.

Because of the mesh point limitation in the Equipoise Burnout
program, it was necessary to omit some physical detail in the cal-
culational model. The control rod thimbles near the center of the
core vere neglected in this model, as were the variations in fuel
fraction and graphite fraction in that region; the main portion of
the core was treated as a single homogeneous mixture. The peripheral
regions of the reactor, including the core can, the fuel annulus, and
the reactor vessel wall, were all homogenized into a single region
(reactor shell in Fig. 11). The materials in the gap between the
reactor and the thermal shield (heaters, heater thimbles, insulation
and insulation liner) were all homogenized and uniformly distributed
throughout the gap. All the structural material inside the thermal
shield was also neglected. A total of 1225 mesh points in a Lo-by-

25 array were used to describe the calculational model.

Nuclear Approximations

 

Two-Group Constants

The Equipoise Burnout program has provisions for calculating 2-
group nuclear constants if the necessary microscopic cross-section
data are supplied as input. In this case, however, it was more ex-
pedient to calculate the 2-group constants separately using MODRIC,
a l-dimensional, 33~group calculation. Multi-group cross sections
were prepared for the MODRIC program using GAM-1 and the existing
cross-section library for that program. A radial criticality cal-
culation was then made with MODRIC for the reactor model with fuel

salt containing 0.6 of the critical concentration of ue3s, the presence

of the external source was neglected in this calculation. The 2-group
constants generated by MODRIC were then used to calculate the flux
distribution in the 2-dimensional model with the source present.
MODRIC calculations were also used to estimate the 2-group con-
stants for the case with no fuel salt in the reactor. In order to
get group constants for the core with only the graphite moderator
present, calculations were made for the normal density of the dilute
fuel and for densities that were 0.5, 0.25, and 0.1 of the normal
value. The 2-group constants obtained from these calculations were
plotted as a function of fuel density and extrapolated to zero density
to get constants for the reactor containing no fuel (only graphite).
For several reasons, the above procedure does not lead to com-
pletely accurate values for the 2-group constants. The fast-group
constants in a given region depend, to some extent, on the energy
distribution of the neutrons in the region. This energy distribution
is different if all of the neutrons are born in the core (as was
assumed in the MODRIC calculations) than if a substantial number
are born in an external source region (as was the case in the 2-
dimensional calculations). Some additional error is introduced by
the fact that neutrons born in the reactor and those born in the
external source have different energy distributions at birth. Neutrons
born in the reactor are products of the fission process and have an
energy distribution that corresponds to the fission distribution; the
fast-group constants were calculated for this birth-energy distribution
(10 to 0.011 Mev with an average of about 2 Mev in the MODRIC program
used). The energy distribution of neutrons produced by a source
depends on the nature of the source. For an Sb-Be source, the average
neutron energy is about 34 Kev. In the Equipoise Burnout calculation
the fast-group constants calculated for fission-source neutrons were
applied to all the fast neutrons, regardless of thelr point of origin,
Since absorption cross sections generally increase with decreasing
neutron energy, this treatment overestimated the neutron flux at the

chambers for a given neutron source.
3h

Source Configuration

 

In the Equipoise Burnout calculation, the source region was treated
as a slender (2 cm by 2.6 cm) prism extending along the entire height
of the reactor model. This is a consequence of applying a constant
axial buckling to all regions. As a result, this source is less
efficient in terms of producing a neutron flux at the core midplane
than a short source of the same total strength located near the mid-
plane. No correction was applied Tor the higher efficiency of the
short source because this underestimate tended to counteract the over-

estimate inherent in the cross-section treatment.

Composition of Thermal Shield

 

The thermal shield is filled with steel balls to provide a mixture
that is approximately 50% iron and 50% water. However, this mixture
does not fill all portions of the thermal shield. The source thimble
and the special counter thimbles are protected by half-sections of 8-in.
pipe which were welded to the inside of the shield to prevent damage
to the thimbles during the addition of the steel balls. As a result,
each of the thimbles is surrounded by a layer of pure water. The
nuclear instrument shaft, which extends to the inner wall of the
thermal shield, contains no steel balls. The only material in this
shaft, other than water, is the aluminum in the guide tubes for the
neutron chambers. The neutron flux at the various chambers is
influenced more by the water layer immediately adjacent to the
thimbles than by the iron-water mixture in the rest of the thermal
shield. Therefore, the presence of the steel balls was neglected in
the flux calculations. This leads to highly erroneous fluxes
everywhere in the thermal shield except in the immediate vicinity of

the neutron chambers.

Use of Diffusion Theory

 

The Equipoise Burnout program which was used to compute the flux
distributions is based on a diffusion theory treatment of the neutron

transport problem. This program was used because is was the only one
: -y

55

Judged to be practical for an approximate calculation of the external
source requirements for the MSRE. It is well known that diffusion
theory has limitations which are imposed by the basic assumptions in
the development of the mathematical treatment. These limitations
restrict the accuracy of the theory in regions with high absorption
cross section, near region boundaries and in regions where the neutron
mean free paths are long. Since all of these factors were present in
the calculational model, the results of the calculations can be
regarded as no more than preliminary estimates. It is likely that

the calculated fluxes are at least within an order of magnitude of

the correct values but it is not possible to define the limits of the

probably error.
