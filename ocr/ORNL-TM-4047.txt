W. R. Grimes and Stanley Cantor

ABSTRACT

The blanket of a fusion reactor serves to absorb and trans-
fer the energy of the fusion reaction products, and to produce
the tritium necessary to refuel the reactor. This report out-
lines how these two functions are performed by lithium-bearing
molten salts.

The strong magnetic fields may have a considerable effect
on the chemical stability and a less significant effect on the
fluid dynamics of a flowing salt. A salt melt flowing across
a strong magnetic field induces an electric field, which in
turn produces an emf between the walls of the conduit and the
adjacent salt. The emf can be lessened to minor proportions by
careful design--causing the salt to flow parallel to the mag-
netic field wherever possible and using a system of small bore
tubes where the flow must cross the magnetic field. Although
flow in the magnetic field parallel to the lines of force
suppresses turbulence (necessary in a salt for adequate heat
transfer), this effect on molten salts will be negligible
owing to their low electrical conductivities.

Breeding of tritium in a molten-salt blanket is at best
marginal when the lithium is in its natural isotopic abundance;
however, the tritium-breeding ratio can be improved by including
blanket regions of lithium or of beryllium, or by enriching
the salt in lithium-6. LiF and its mixtures with BeF,; are the
best molten-salt ccolants in which to breed tritium in quanti-
ties adequate for fueling a reactor. Molten LiF-BeF, is advan-
tageous in recovering tritium since, in contact with metallic
Ni, Mo, or W, virtually all of tritium is present as TF.

While fluorides are adequate heat-transfer agents and
possess good radiation stability, neutronic transmutation of
Be and F in the salt ca lead to corrosion unless a redox
buffer (analogous to U3 Ju% in a fission reactor) is included
in the melt.

In a blanket which has two coolants, one being metallic
lithium, salts other than LiF-BeF, could be considered. For
example, LiCl-KCl, melting at 354°C, may be adequate as vacuum
wall coolant and as the fluid to transport heat to the steam
system of the reactor.
INTRODUCTION

A controlled thermonuclear reactor (CTR) that fuses deuterons with
tritons yields 17.6 Mev per fusion event mostly in the form of very
energetic neutrons. Such a device requires a blanket system, a more or
less complex composite of several materials, capable of performing at
least two functions. These functions are (a) absorption of the energy
carried by the energetic fusion reaction products and transfer of heat
generated in the blanket to the power-producing portion of the reactor,
and (b) generation of tritium, in a manner such as to enable its ready
recovery, to replace that consumed in the fusion reaction. The first of
these functions certainly requires a suitable heat transfer fluid. The
second requires that the blanket contain a sufficiency of lithium, from
which tritium can be effectively bred. Though these two functions are
separable in principle,? there is probably a considerable advantage,
other than elegance, if the coolant fluid can be a liquid with suffi-
cient lithium to sustain the required tritium production.

The coolant fluid must meet several criteria. These are generally
similar to the requirements imposed on molten salts as fuels for fission
reactor fuels (1). It must not adversely interact with neutrons necessary
for breeding of tritium. It must be a good heat transfer fluid and its
heat transfer and hydrodynamic behavior must (for most applications) be
adequate in the presence of large magnetic fields. It must be non-
corrosive toward metals of construction in the blanket region, the pumps,
and the power generation equipment. It must be suitably stable to the
intense radiation fields within the blanket and it must not react violently
if, upon failure of the heat transfer equipment, it is inadvertently
mixed with the power-generating fluid (steam, potassium, etc.). It should,
in addition, possess a relatively low vapor pressure to minimize stresses
on the blanket structure, and it should be compatible with auxiliary
blanket subsystems such as neutron moderators (graphites) or neutron

multipliers. Finally, this fluid should also be capable of efficient

 

11t is possible, at present, to visualize a blanket in which tritium is
bred in (essentially) stationary bodies of lithium metal, lithium alloys,
or lithium salts, with the necessary cooling accomplished by another
fluid--molten sodium, pressurized helium, gas, or molten salt.
generation of tritium and it should be of a nature such as to permit
easy recovery of the tritium for return to the fusion cycle.

This paper attempts to assess the potential of molten salts as
blanket fluids in controlled thermonuclear reactors. As matters stand at
present, several entirely different types of CTRs are potentially feasible.
This fact coupled with the possibility (even the likelihood) that the
coolant and the breeding functions are separable makes it impossible to
examine in a single document all the credible combinations.

We have chosen instead, in what we hope will prove to be a continuing
examination of the overall problem, to do the following:

1. To assess the problems for the most difficult case, a single
molten salt coolant and breeder blanket in a closed magnetic field device.
We will use molten Li,BeF,, probably the most studied and best understood
of the possible candidates, for this assessment in a hypothetical Tokamak;
a Stellerator would be equivalent in nearly every regard.

2. To compare several molten salts for this and other less demanding
possible CTR uses,

3. To consider, briefly, application of molten salts for a laser-
powered fusion device whose problems are quite different, and finally

4. To compare and contrast these molten salts with molten lithium

as the blanket fluid.

BEHAVIOR OF LiyBeF, IN A HYPOTHETICAL CTR

The most difficult problems which must be surmounted by a molten salt
in a CTR blanket system are, almost certainly, those imposed if the salt
must serve as the single-fluid blanket-coolant for a closed magnetic field
(and essentially steady state) CTR. The precise magnitude of these
problems will depend upon the detailed design of the device--its power
level, size, temperature and temperature differential, and coolant passage
patterns within the blanket region. To illustrate the nature and general
magnitude of the problems we have chosen a toroidal CTR, blanketed and
cooled with molten Li,BeF,, of the size and characteristics shown in

Table 1.2 The blanket dimensions are essentially those proposed by

 

This design is a hybrid from sources indicated in the text. It is pre-
sented only for illustration of several problems to be described.
Fraas (2) for a lithium-metal cooled device; the magnetic fields

are those indicated in an Oak Ridge National Laboratory study (3); flow
rate and temperature differential are scaled from a proposed 1000 MW (e)
molten salt fission reactor (4).

It is clear from Table 1, that the efficiency of the device (ca 45%)
presupposes temperatures above 700°C for the coolant outlet and that mean
residence time of the fluid within the active blanket region is (since
only a small fraction of the inventory is in the pumps, piping, and heat
exchangers) approximately five minutes. It is assumed for this particular
device that the Li,BeF, is pumped through the blanket region (and through
the enormous magnetic field) at 120 cubic feet per second and directly
to equipment for generation of high quality steam. These assumptions, as
to pumping rates, AT, and steam generation compatibility, are not unlike
those proposed for molten salt breeder (fission) reactors (MSBRs) (4).

It is worthy of note that the mean radiation load on the LizBeF,
(ca 1.1 watts/gram) is more than 10-fold below that proposed for MSBRs.
This comparison is, however, deceptively favorable toward MSBRs in that
. these reactors can assure moderately uniform radiation levels within
their fuels while CTIRs cannot do so for their blankets. It is likely
that radiation densities in CTR blanket near the plasma-confinement
(first) wall will be larger than those proposed for the MSBR. This CIR
radiation density is not, however, likely to approach the maximum radia-
tion density at which molten salts have been tested (5).

Such a device as that described above will, on the other hand, pose
several problems for the Li,BeF,. Some of these problems are similar
and some are quite different from those posed by use as fuel solvents in
fission reactors. These problems are defined and discussed in the

following sections.

Effects of Strong Magnetic Fields

Pumping a conducting fluid into (across the magnetic field lines of)
a closed magnetic field device poses a problem. For a liquid metal this
problem manifests itself as a large pumping power loss due tc magneti-
cally induced turbulence; for molten salts the effect appears as chemical
destabilization. After the fluid is within the magnetic field one can,
in principle (and perhaps, with considerable difficulty, in practice)
make the flow channels conform closely to the magnetic lines of force.
In that case the magnetic field may exert a pronounced effect upon the
fluid dynamics of the flowing stream.
Effects on Chemical Stability

From electromagnetic theory it is known that the electric field
induced in a conducting fluid crossing a magnetic field is given by
the cross-product of fluid velocity and magnetic field:

-> o>
E=VxB

Molten LiBeF, (or any conducting fluid) flowing at 10 meters/
second in a pipe of 5 cm diameter with its axis aligned perpendicular to
the lines of force of an 80 kgauss (8 volt-sec/meter?) magnetic field

will have induced, at right angles to both the magnetic field and the
flow direction, a potential difference of 4 volts between the salt and
the pipe wall. Potential differences of such magnitudes are clearly
intolerable; though LiF and BeF, are both very stable compounds (6) an
induced voltage such as this (equivalent to destabilization by 92 kcal /
mole) would make these compounds quite corrosive to the metallic tube
walls.

Homeyer (7), who seems to have been the first to consider such
electrolytic corrosion in a CTR blanket system, noted that such corro-
sion should be alleviated by (a) reducing fluid velocities perpendicular
to the magnetic field, and (b) using a series of parallel pipes to
reduce the pipe dimension where flow across the magnetic field lines
are necessary.

If, for example, the 120 ft?/sec flow of Li,BeF,; required of our
hypothetical 1000 MW(e) CTR were supplied at a flow rate of 4 meters/sec
through pipes of 4 cm diameter perpendicular to the 25 kgauss field? the
emf induced in each pipe would be 0.4 volts; some 675 pipes would be
required. If these pipes penetrated the field at 30° to the field lines
this emf would be reduced to 0.2 volts. These conditions would seem to
be tolerable. Alternatively, by supplying external cooling to each pipe,
as it crosses the magnetic field lines, so as to form a poorly conducting
layer of frozen salt on the inner pipe wall, it may be possible to reduce
the number of pipes and to somewhat increase their size. Periodic
replacement of corroded pipe sections might also be considered, since they
are located at the periphery of the torus. 4

Plasma stability in a reactor such as this requires a pulsed poloidal
magnetic field transverse to the main field and, accordingly, perpendicu-
lar to the fluid flow parallel to the fuel lines of the main (toroidal)
field. Chemical effects of this poloidal field (which may reach 7 kgauss)

may not be trivial, but they would seem, in general, to be tolerable.

 

3This is roughly the maximum field between the coils (3) in a pipe
entering the outer edge of the torus.

“Other alternatives exist. It should be possible to penetrate the field
by shafts of mechanical pumps to permit use of Li,BeF,; to transfer heat
to (for example) a boiling potassium cycle within the magnetic field.
Such alternatives are beyond the scope of this document.
It is clear that the problems outlined above deserve experimental
study especially in the area of kinetics of de- and re-stabilization of
real fluids upon passage through intense magnetic fields.

Effects on Fluid Dynamics

 

To avoid induced electric fields as discussed above, flow of the
blanket fluid within the torus will be aligned with the magnetic lines of
force. However, in that case the magnetic field will exert a force
opposed to eddies within the fluid and will tend to damp turbulent flow.
Heat loadings in the blanket structure of a CTR, and especially at the
first (plasma-confining) wall, will be very large, and molten LisBeF,
must develop turbulent flow if it is to cool this wall effectively. It
is important, therefore, to assess this damping effect of the field on
turbulent flow in the salt.

No experimental study of magnetic damping in molten salt has been
reported, but experiments with liquid mercury have been performed (8,9).
These experiments with mercury appear to provide a means of estimating
the Reynolds number at which the transition from laminar to turbulent
flow occurs. A dimensionless quantity which characterizes the magnetic
forces that affect flow is called the Hartmann number (M), and is defined:

M = B(o/n)?

where B is the applied field,
f{ is a characteristic length, usually the half-width of the
flow channel,
og is the fluid's electrical conductivity, and
nn is the viscosity

In the absence of a magnetic field the laminar-turbulent transition
occurs at Reynolds number ®,) of about 2200; in the presence of the field
this transition occurs at a higher Reynolds number ®). This increase
(more commonly the ratio ®,/R) is a function of the Hartman number (M).
Three such correlation functions have been published (8,9,10).

For Li,BeF, at 600°C, the electrical conductivity (11) is 220
(ohm-meter) "1, the viscosity is 8 x 1072 kg/(sec-meter). Accordingly,
for this material in a 80 kgauss (8 webers/meter?) field and assuming a
6 cm (3 cm half-width) channel the value of the Hartman number is 40. If
we apply each of the three correlations (8,9,10) developed from experi-

ments with mercury to a fluid of
M = 40
we find the transition Reynolds number should rise from R, = 2200 to
Ry = 2720, 3740, and 2400, respectively. The effect of magnetic field
on this fluid is, therefore, predicted to be relatively small.

These three values for Ry are very much less than values estimated
for flows in the first wall region. As an approximation let us assume
that to cool the vacuum wall we require 40 ft? per second of salt (one
third the quantity required to cool the entire blanket) and that this
salt flows through a 6 cm wide annulus around the 7 meter diameter first
wall. The linear velocity of salt is 0.85 meters/sec, the density (11)
(at 600°C) of LiyBeF, is 1990 kg/meter? and the viscosity is 8 centipoise.
The Reynolds number under these conditions is about 13,000.

These data strongly suggest that molten LisBeF, can be made to flow
turbulently within the blanket system, but direct experiments with molten
salts would certainly appear desirable.’

Any transverse magnetic field will also act to suppress turbulence.

Hoffman and Carlson (10) propose the formula, R, = 500M for calculating

the transition Reynolds number of Mercury Flowing transverse to the
magnetic field. The same formula applied to LiyBeF, at 600°C flowing in
a 6-cm thick channel transverse to 8 kgauss (the poloidal field strength)
yields

Ry = 500M = 2000.
This result suggests that an 8 kgauss poloidal field in a toroidal
reactor may not affect turbulence in LiyBeF,; at most, the suppression
of turbulence by this field will be comparable to the effects of the

toroidal field.

 

"Metallic lithium is expected to be quite different. The Hartman number
for Li is 12,000 for the condition where that of Li;BeF, is 40; the
corresponding Rt for lithium is, accordingly, above 700,000. It would
appear that Li will be constrained to laminar flow; it seems likely,
however, that (because of its good thermal conductivity) it can
adequately cool the first wall.
Production of Tritium

It is obviously necessary to use the neutrons produced in fusion to
breed the tritium required to fuel a D-T reactor. If the only sources of
tritium were today's transmutation facilities then the fuel cost alone
would be about 1.2 cents per kilowatt-hour.®

The only practical neutron reactions which will yield tritium
sufficient for the needs of a D-T fusion reactor are °Li(n,x)T and
7Li(n,om')T. The latter is a high-energy reaction with a threshold at
2.5 MeV. Neutron-capture cross sections of ®Li become significant only
at energies of 0.5 MeV and less. The ‘Li reaction is particularly
favorable since the product neutron (n') can react with °Li to yield a
second tritium atom, but because the blanket contains elements which
scatter and absorb high-energy neutrons, the production of tritium from
“Li is not very efficient. When the lithium in the blanket is in
natural isotopic abundance (92.58% Ii, 7.42% 6Li), the greater fraction
of tritium is produced from °Li.

Several studies have been reported concerning the breeding of
tritium in fusion reactor blankets (12-16). In cases where the lithium
is in natural isotopic abundance, tritium-breeding ratios clearly greater
than unity are calculated for lithium metal blankets; the breeding ratios
for lithium salts are distinctly less favorable. Table 2 presents some
very recent calculations for four salts and for lithium metal all in the
same blanket configuration. Some of the neutron cross sections, partic-
ularly those for the n,Q, and n,n'?Y reactions of fluorine (17), are
uncertain. The values in Table 2 are, therefore, more useful for com-

7 uncertain-

parison than for accurate prediction of tritium production;

ties of perhaps 10% in the calculated breeding ratios are possible.
Three options, either alone or in combination, can be considered

for upgrading tritium production when the breeding ratio is marginal

as appears to be the case for Li,BeF,.8 These are:

 

%Based on a tritium cost of 10 cents/curie and 22 MeV/fusion utilized in
a plant operating at 40% thermal efficiency.

"It should be noted that Blow, et al. (14) calculate a tritium breeding
ratio of 1.027 for LipBeF, in a blanket assembly similar to that of
Table 2.

8possible use of LiF, LiCl, and Li,CO5 is discussed briefly in a subse-
quent section of this report.

(¢) modest enrichment of the blanket material in °Li.

The second option was briefly treated by Bell (16) who showed that
if a blanket region (40 cm thick adjoining a 1 cm first wall of molybdenum)
were changed from Li,BeF, to an equal thickness of Be and LiBeF,, the
tritium-breeding ratio would increase from 0.95 to 1.50.

The third option has also received some attention. Impink a3)
reported that small increases in 611i enrichment of the Li,BeF, blanket
led to modest gains in breeding ratio. For example, increasing the 61,1

isotopic fraction to 0.2 in a 6.25-cm thick coolant region next to the

first wall improves the total breeding ratio by about 3%. Although
11

enrichment costs are high, these costs would be partly offset by improved
shielding of the magnet coils and by reduced radiation damage to the
first wall through reduced resonance capture (13).

In light of present knowledge of the pertinent cross sections, it
appears that the breeding capability of Li,BeF,; is marginal in devices
such as our hypothetical torus. This material would, therefore, probably
need to be augmented by one of the methods indicated above, or by other
means. It is clear that better cross section data are needed so that

this point can be decided.

Recovery of Tritium

Approximately 270 grams of tritium are consumed per day by fusion in
a 2250 MW(t) D-T reactor. Slightly more than this, or approximately
300 grams per day, must be produced and recovered; this corresponds to
some 50 moles of T, or to 100 moles of TF per day. In our hypothetical
CTR the mean residence time of the fluid in the blanket is 5 minutes per
cycle. Some 0.174 moles of Ts, or 0.348 moles TF is, accordingly,
produced in the Li,BeF, in this interval. If the fluid entering the
blanket contained no tritium species the fluid emerging from the blanket
will contain about 1.74 x 1077 moles T, (or alternatively about 3.48 x 1077
moles TF) per liter if complete homogeneity is assumed. The problems in
recovery and management of the tritium depends significantly on whether
the material exists as T, or as TF. These two situations, and the extent
to which the mode of tritium behavior can be controlled, are briefly
described in the following.

Solubility of Hy in molten Li,BeF, has been shown to increase
linearly with pressure of Hy; at 1000°K, the solubility should be near
7 x 107° moles H, per liter of salt per atmosphere of Hp, (18). No
studies of tritium solubility have been reported. If the bred tritium
occurs as Ty, and if the solubility behavior of T, and Hy; are similar,
the emerging blanket fluid carries T, (generated during its pass through
the blanket) equivalent to a saturating pressure of about 2.5 x 1073
atmospheres. Equilibration of the emerging salt with a relatively small
volume of inert gas will result in stripping of a very large fraction of

this dissolved T, from the salt. It is clear, however, that this process
12

(with 120 ft of salt and, for example, 1 ft? of He) will be difficult
to engineer, and, moreover, that diffusivity of Ty; at such effective
partial pressures through hot metal surfaces will pose problems.

The solubility of HF in molten LipBeF, also depends linearly on
pressure of the solute gas, and its Henry's law constant is 107? moles
HF per liter of salt per atmosphere HF at 1000°K (19). The TF produced
during each cycle of coolant through the blanket region will correspond
to about 3.5 x 1077 moles TF per liter of Li,BeF,;; this is equivalent
to a saturation pressure of about 3.5 x 107° atmospheres of TF. The TF
will be more difficult to strip from the salt than will Tp, but TF will
not diffuse through the metal walls. If its reaction with the metal
walls can be sufficiently minimized, the TF concentration can be allowed
to increase and the rate of processing the blanket fluid can be corres-
pondingly reduced. If, for example, the TF can be allowed to concentrate
until its pressure is 10~2 atmospheres, sparging of perhaps 5 £13 /sec of
the fluid with helium should suffice for effective recovery of the bred
tritium. It is, accordingly, worthwhile to examine whether the bred
tritium can reasonably be maintained as TF.

Tritium produced, for example, from

LiF +n — “He + T' + F~

is, in principle, born as an oxidized species. The tolerable concentra-
tion of TF, or of any other oxidized species, will, of course, be limited
by the extent to which corrosive reaction with the CTR metal can occur.
If the containment metal is sufficiently inert, useful concentrations of
TF can be maintained without appreciable reaction.

By way of illustration, let us examine the reaction of HF with nickel,

HF (g) + iNi(c) = 1H, (g) + 3NiF, (ad)
where (g), (¢), and (d) indicate, respectively, that the species is gas-
eous, crystalline solid, or dissolved in molten Li,BeF,. From the data
of Table 3 AGC = 10.9 keal for this reaction at 1000°K. The equilibrium
constant is given by . .
K = Sur, hy Hy = 4 x 1073
of; Far
13

where N is the mole fraction of dissolved NiF,, a is the activity of
nickel (unity in this case), and P is the partial pressure of the desig-
nated gaseous species. If we set NyiF, = 3,2 x 107° (equivalent to 6
parts per million of wi2t, a value that seems likely to be tolerable) we
calculate pressures of Hy, of 6 x 10-° atmospheres and 5 x 10-% atmos-
pheres, respectively, in equilibrium with HF pressures of 3.5 x 10™° and
10-3 atmospheres. These results suggest that if the CTR metal were Ni
a very large fraction of the tritium could be maintained as TF and
stripped as such.

Examination of Table 3 suggests that the situdtion may be even more
favorable for molybdenum and, perhaps, for tungsten as the containment
metal. However, if the containment metal were iron, chromium, niobium,
tantalum, titanium, or, probably, vanadium the tritium must, of necessity,
be stripped and handled as Tr. If one of these more reactive metals
proves necessary as the CTR material, some way of preventing corrosion due
to

xIF + M — MF + Ir,

must be provided. This would seem to be possible by incorporation of a
redox buffer (described in more detail in the subsequent section) in the
molten LiyBeF,.

At this stage in the technology of fusion reactors one should
probably not dismiss the possibility of using stainless steel or a
chromium-containing nickel-based alloy at temperatures at or below 1000°K.
Such materials can, perhaps, be coated with molybdenum, tungsten, or

nickel, by electrodeposition (22) or by plasma spraying (23).

Chemical Transmutations
Several types of chemical transmutations will occur in molten
LiyBeF, in its service as the blanket fluid in a fusion reactor. The
most important of these, and means for maintenance of the blanket to
minimize or avoid their deleterious effects, are the following:
Transmutation of lithium is, of course, essential to production of
tritium. The overall reactions can be represented as
"LiF +n —» %He + TF + n', and
6LiF + n —» %He + TF.

These reactions are not inherently oxidizing or reducing, though, as
described in the previous section, the generated TF can oxidize reactive
structural metals to form metal fluorides which will dissolve in the melt.
Transmutation of beryllium (as BeF2 in Li,BeF,) leads to corrosion
of any system metal since disappearance of Be?” is equivalent to release
of fluorine. The two reactions may be represented as:
BeF, + n —» 2n + 23He + 2F (or Fp), and

BeF, +n — 5He + §He + 2F, followed by

STe 0.8 sec half life $1.1, and

811i + F — OLiF.

 

In our 2250 MW reactor, these reactions yield, respectively, the equivalent
of 500 g and 70 g of fluorine per day. This problem is generally similar

to that encountered in fission of uranium (as UF,) in the MSRE (1);
15

it is clearly necessary to provide a redox buffer in the molten salt
(the UF3-UF,; couple does this in fission reactors), capable of oxidizing
FO to F~. It is also necessary, if Ni, Mo, or W constitutes the container
system, that this redox buffer be consistent with maintenance of the
tritium as TF. The couple

ce3” = (ett
may possibly serve this function. If, for example, the concentration
of cerium in the melt is set at 10™% mole fraction the blanket will con-
tain 6 x 10% mole of Ce®* + Ce*?, and the Ce3*t/Ce** ratio would require
chemical adjustment on a cycle time of many days. If, on the other hand,
the container metal is Nb (or some other metal which will reduce TF in
dilution solution) the redox couple must be chosen so as to be consider-
ably more reducing. It must deal with the Fy, generated by transmutation
of beryllium but it must also reduce the 100 moles per day of TF produced
by transmutation in the LiF. Such a buffer system would require adjust-
ment on a cycle of a few days.

In addition, transmutation of fluorine occurs upon capture of
neutrons of energy above about 3 MeV. This reaction may be represented
by

18F" +n — ON” + %He.
This nitrogen isotope decays, with a 7.3 sec. half-life, to an oxygen
isotope

ey” 5 1%0 +87,
and the result is probably, although the mechanism. may be complex, grow-
in of 027. The gbsolute quantity of 1®N formed by this reaction is
relatively uncertain; it is estimated to be, within a factor of three,
120 grams/day. The very short half-life of this isotope guarantees that
all the 1°N decays within the CTR blanket. The concentration of lop,
in whatever chemical form, within the Li,BeF, cannot exceed 1.1 parts
in 1011. However, some fraction of this material will react with the
CTR contairment metal; decay of this isotope will lead to formation of
metal oxide in the CTR metal. This may, especially if it concentrates
within the grain boundaries, prove troublesome. If all the 16y- decayed
within the blanket salt, the oxide concentration of our hypothetical CIR

would increase about 60 parts per billion per day. Since 10 to 50
16

parts per million of oxide is almost certainly tolerable, a process for
removal of oxide on a cycle time of several months to several years
should suffice.

Finally, it should be noted that the transmutation reactions
shown all generate He. For the hypothetical CTR the daily production
of helium is about 125 gram atoms or nearly 100 standard cubic feet.
Helium is relatively insoluble in molten LisBeF,; (24); the solubility
at 1000°K is 1.7 x 10™% moles He per liter salt per atmosphere. Helium
produced per pass of blanket salt corresponds to a saturation pressure
of 2.6 x 1072 atmospheres. If no sparging were attempted the helium

pressure would reach 1 atmosphere in about 30 hours.

Compatibility of Li,BeF, with CTR Metals and Moderators

As indicated in Table 3 above, LiF and BeF; in molten Li,BeF, are
very stable materials. Both are much more stable than the structural
metal fluorides; consequently, corrosion due to chemical reactions with
these major blanket constituents should prove minimal. Indeed, experi-
ence with the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (25) has shown negligible
corrosion by this fluid on a nickel-base alloy (Hastelloy N). However,
such salts are excellent fluxes for metallic oxides and halides, and
films of such substances afford no protection against oxidizing agents
carried by such melts; accordingly, as described above, HF (or TF) may
react with the containment metal, and impurity ions such as Ni?t will
react with metallic iron or chromium in the container metal (1).

Melts such as Li,BeF, are chemically inert toward, and do not wet,
graphite (1). However, the possibility that such salts will transfer
graphite and carburize metals such as Mo or Nb cannot be discounted.

It is not likely that a system built of Mo, Nb, or V can use molten
Li,BeF, and unclad graphite without adverse interactions. Similarly,
metallic Be cannot react appreciably with LiyBeF, (but the Be could
certainly react with TF or with the Ce3F/cett couple proposed as a redox
buffer in the system). Any real use of metallic Be as a neutron multi-
plier in the blanket system, therefore, presupposes that the Be is clad

with an inert metal.
17

Other processes which could conceivably give rise to corrosion can
be dismissed as highly improbable. Direct dissolution of structural
metals in Li,BeF, has never been observed. Salt decomposition caused
by the slowing down of energetic particles should not lead to corrosion
provided that the salt is kept at elevated temperatures. Experience
gained in the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (26) and in an extensive
in-pile radiation testing program showed that as long as the temperature
was greater than 150°¢ (27), radiolytic decomposition was of no impor-

tance to corrosion of structural metals or graphite.

Compatibility with Steam, Air, and Liquid Metals

In any system of heat-exchangers and hot flowing liquids, there
exists a real and finite probability that leaks will occur. In this
section we examine the consequences of leaks and intermixing of other
fluids and Li,BeF,.

The reaction of steam with LipBeF, yields HF and BeO

H,0(g) + BeF, (4) = BeO(e) + 2HF(g)

though the reaction is not particularly exothermic. Both H,0 and HF are
likely to corrode the metal in contact with the salt; corrosion-product
fluorides will dissolve or be otherwise carried by the salt. Since BeO
is only very slightly soluble (125 ppm at 500°C) in Li,BeF, (28), a
large in-leakage of steam would soon lead to the precipitation of BeO in
the salt circuit. Leakage of air into LiF or Li,BeF, will have trouble-
some, but not hazardous, consequences. Dry air will not react directly
with either salt; however, air oxidation of surfaces in contact with the
salt will result in dissolution by the salt and, if continued, in
ultimate precipitation of BeO. Moisture in the air will also react, as
does steam, with Li,BeF,. The molten Li,BeF, can, if necessary, be
freed of oxide by treatment at elevated temperatures with anhydrous
HF (29).

In some CTR designs suggested in a subsequent section of this paper,
Li,BeF, (or other salt) could inadvertently be mixed with liquid alkali
metals. From LiyBeF,, metallic Li, Na, or K react to precipitate Be

metal, but the reaction is not highly exothermic.
18

In general, although inadvertent mixing of Li,BeF, (or most other
molten salts) with other CTR fluids would prove troublesome, such mixing

would not lead to violent or explosive reactions.

CHOICE OF MOST PROMISING SALTS

In this section we attempt to answer two questions. These are:

(2) if tritium must be bred in the blanket-coolant which lithium-bearing
salt is best, and (b) if the coolant and breeding function of the blanket
can be separated which are the most promising molten salt coolants?

In answer to the first question, it must be conceded that obtaining
breeding ratios greater than unity with molten salts alone may pose a
real difficulty. Table 2 above suggests that LiCl and Li,CO03 show, in
reasonable (though not optimized) blanket configurations, breeding
ratios that are unsatisfactory. Breeding ratios have also been calculated
for LiNO, (13) and LiNO; (15); the results tend to be quite unfavorable.
Impink (13), for example, obtained the value 0.82 for LiNO,.° No calcu-
lations appear to have been made for Li,SO0,, but the high cross sections
for S(n,®) and S(n,p) reactions almost certainly will reduce the breed-
ing ratio below that for 1.i,CO3. Moreover, LiNO; and LiNO3 lack the
thermal stability required of truly high temperature coolants, and
Li,C03 and Li,S0, will oxidize many CIR structural materials.

Lithium hydroxide seems to be eliminated, even if (as is unlikely)
its properties are otherwise satisfactory, because its hydrogen would
excessively dilute the bred tritium. Lithium oxide (iO) has a lithium
density nearly 50% above that of metallic lithium, but its melting point
of nearly 1470°C (6) eliminates it as a major constituent of a blanket
fluid. Lithium chloride melts at 610°C (6) and should be reasonably
compatible with CTR metals, but its breeding ratio (see Table 2) appears
inferior.

The salt with the most favorable breeding ratio is LiF. This salt
is inert toward graphite and to metals under consideration for the blanket

structure. The major drawback of LiF is its melting point of 848°¢c.

 

%In the same configuration he calculated 1.15 for Li,BeF,.
19

Because of this high melting temperature, LiF cannot be used to transfer
heat to the steam system of the reactor. If the blanket region were oper-
ated at very high temperatures (>900°0) , then LiF could be used in conjunc-
tion with an intermediate heat-exchange medium--liquid Na, a lower melting
salt, or perhaps a boiling alkali metal system. The melting point of LiF
can be substantially lowered by many solutes; the ideal solute should lower
the melting point below 374°010 without affecting either the breeding gain
or the generally favorable heat-removal and chemical properties of LiF.

We know of no such solute. Dissolved Li,0 should increase the breeding
ratio slightly, but considering the probable limited solubility of Li,O0,
the melting temperature (more accurately, liquidus temperature) of LiF will
not drop below 800°C. Using AlF; and/or another alkali fluoride to lower
the melting temperature to ~700°C should not have dire chemical consequences,
but the breeding ratio will almost certainly suffer. The nearest approxi-
mation to an ideal solute in LiF is probably BeF,. The phase diagram for
LiF-BeF, (30), presented in Fig. 1, shows that a melting temperature as low
as 363°C is available in this system. Unfortunately, the viscosity of the
melt increases with BeF, concentration, and mixtures with >40 mole ¢ BeF;
have viscosities greater than 50 centipoise at 450°C (31). The optimum
salt mixture of low melting temperature and acceptable viscosity, and with
a reasonably good tritium breeding ratio is at ~33 mole 9 BeF,, correspond-
ing to the LigBeF, used for illustrative purposes in earlier sections of
this report. Decreasing the BeF, concentration below 33 mole % may have a
modest beneficial effect upon breeding ratio; this increase might, possibly,
offset disadvantages posed by the increased liquidus temperature and likely
changes in chemical behavior.

In summary, the answer to the first question posed above--the best
blanket coolant salt in which to breed tritium is LiF, but its melting
point of 848°¢c limits its usefulness only for cooling a blanket that
operates above this temperature. If the blanket coolant must also trans-
fer heat to the steam system, Li,BeF,, or some modest variant of this
composition, appears to be the best choice.

A partial separation of breeding and cooling functions, posed in the

second question above, has been approached by Steiner (12). He calculated

the tritium breeding ratio for a blanket design in which Li,BeF, cooled
the vacuum wall and lithium metal assumed the rest of the hesgt-transfer
function, and showed that the breeding ratio (1.22) was 8.3% less than
that (1.33) for the same blanket with lithium as the sole coolant. This
small loss in breeding ratio suggests that other salts, especially those
melting below 374°¢, might also serve as vacuum-wall coolants. Moreover,
the heat carried by the lithium might then be transferred outside of the
blanket to a molten salt of the same composition as the vacuum-wall coolant.
The salt streams from the vacuum wall and the lithium heat-exchanger would
then be combined and pumped to the steam-raising system. The eutectic
mixture of LiCl and KCl, which melts at 354°C (32), might be suitable for
such service. The authors are presently assessing the implications of
this "double-coolant" concept.

In principle, a complete separation of breeding and cooling functions
might be embodied in a blanket design in which a molten salt cools the
vacuun wall, a moderately thick region of quiescent lithium metal, and a

graphite moderator-reflector.l?®

The coolant salt for this application
must have great chemical stability (to avoid deleterious destabilization
in the magnetic field and to avoid corrosion of the CTR metal), sound
heat transfer properties, and, preferably, a low freezing point. These
specifications narrow the choice of major component to fluorides, chlorides,
and oxides, of lighter alkali and alkaline earth metals which melt below
1200°C. The list seems to contain LiF, LiCl, NaF, NaCl, Na,0, KF, KCl,
BeF,, MgCl,, and CaCl, with, perhaps, other compounds of these families
as possible minor constituents of mixtures. When one adds the further
requirement that the coolant not lower the breeding ratio below unity,
the list of useful major components becomes smaller. The high inelastic
scattering cross sections for Mg, for example, probably eliminates any
substantial concentration of MgCl, from the coolant. From consideration

of this list of materials it would appear that LiF is best except for its
high melting point, that Li,BeF, may well be the best overall choice, and

 

11A possible rationale for such a design is that lithium, though providing
a comfortable breeding ratio, cannot be made to flow turbulently within
the Hlanket and may require excessive power in being pumped through the
major magnetic field.
22

that, if subsequent calculations show that the breeding ratio does not
suffer unduly, the ternary eutectic LiF-NaF-KF (melting point 454°C) and
the binary eutectic LiCl-KCl may be suitable coolants.

Practical problems with these materials will differ in detail from
those described earlier for LisBeF,. Superficial examination of these
problems reveal none that seem insuperable, but much experimental study

would be necessary before use of these materials could be assured.

MOLTEN SALTS IN LASER-INDUCED FUSION REACTORS

Two major uncertainties in use of LiyBeF, in CTRs such as our hypo-
thetical device stem from (a) potentailly troublesome interactions with
the large magnetic field and (b) the fact that the first (plasma-contain-
ing) wall and blanket structure degrade the neutron spectrum so that the
Li(n,an')T reaction is reduced and tritium breeding becomes marginal.
It is, accordingly, a matter of some interest to examine briefly the
potential of molten salts in a CTR device which possesses neither a
magnetic field nor a first wall.

Lubin and Fraas (33) have described a device in which pellets of
deuterium and tritium produce a plasma upon ignition by an energy pulse
from a suitable laser. The blanket-coolant fluid (Lubin and Fraas pro-
posed metallic lithium) is pumped through the reaction vessel and through
external power generation equipment. The liquid is pumped into the
(essentially spherical) reaction vessel tangentially to provide
a very rapid swirl; ignition of the pellet occurs in the vortex so
formed on the vertical center-line of the vessel. The plasma generated
in this pulsed device requires no magnetic containment, and the blanket
coolant liquid is exposed directly to radiation from the plasma.

In addition to its coolant and breeding functions such a liquid must
also provide attenuation of the severe shock waves sufficient to assure
feasibility of the reactor vessel. Lubin and Fraas proposed to assist
this function by introduction of (compressible) gas bubbles into the
swirling liquid.

These shock waves are caused by (a) partial conversion of neutronic
energy into mechanical energy within the liquid, and (b) deposition of

x-ray energy in the liquid at the vortex surface. The former is by far
23

the dominant perturbing force (34). According to an analysis by
Dresner (34), the impulse to the vessel wall due to the neutronically
induced shock is proportional to

OuCp™* Rt
where CO is the volume expansivity, uw is the sonic velocity, Co is the
specific heat, and Ry is a neutron attenuation distance which depends
upon neutron scattering and absorption reactions. The values of these

four quantities for Li,BeF, and for Li are:

 

Li, BeF, (600°C) Li (600°C)
a (Cc) 2.4 x 107% (11) 2.1 x 107% (35)
nu (em sec”) 3.0 x 10% 4.3 x 10° (36)
C, (erg g=1 o¢c-1) 2.4 x 107 (11) 4.2 x 107 (35)
Ry (em) 23 (34) 33 (34)

 

8Fstimated.

This analysis suggests that the walls of a vessel filled with molten
LiyBeF, will suffer an impulse almost twice that of an identical vessel
filled with lithium metal. This conclusion, coupled with the fact that
enhanced centrifugal forces (Li,BeF, is nearly four times as dense as Li)
will make suspension of gas bubbles more difficult in the salt, would
seem to place LisBeF, at some disadvantage.l?

It seems apparent, however, that design and construction of this
vessel to withstand repeated shocks over a long life will pose formidable
problems. Metallic lithium at temperatures of 500°C and sbove is likely
to prove compatible with relatively few (and generally expensive and
exotic) materials. It is possible that Li,BeF, (or other salts), which
are compatible with a much wider spectrum of metals may have real
advantages in easing this difficult design problem.

Problems with chemical transmutations and with recovery and manage-

ment of tritium seem generally similar to, and should be handled by methods

like, those described above for the hypothetical toroidal device. It

 

12pifferences in liquid properties will probably be relatively unimportant
in attenuating the shock waves. The entrained bubbles almost certainly
will be the principal shock-absorbers.
24

seems likely that the ease of tritium recovery may give the molten salts
gn additional advantage.

Finally, it should be noted that the absence of the first wall leads
to decidedly improved breeding. Metallic lithium will still prove to
possess the highest ratios, but it seems certain that LiyzBeF, will have
values markedly above unity. Indeed, it is likely that several lithium-
bearing salt compositions would be possible breeders in this sort of

laser-powered CTR.

SUMMARY: GENERAL COMPARISON OF
MOLTEN SALTS WITH LITHIUM IN FUSION REACTORS

In summary, and to supplement the several preceding discussions, we
briefly compare liquid lithium with salts (especially Li,BeF,) in several
regards.

Lithium metal is clearly superior to any molten salt in breeding of
tritium; this seems certainly true in any CTR embodiment. Certain pro-
posed designs, of which the laser-powered devices are the best examples,
can certainly breed sufficient tritium using molten salts alone. However,
the indication that tritium breeding is marginal for the salts in some
(if not most) designs represents the worst drawback to their use. Fluo-
ride salts are also inferior to lithium in that, primarily because of
fluorine's relatively high cross-section for ineleastic neutron scatter-
ing, the salts are more intense gamma sources and cause increased gamma
heating of the vacuum wall (12).

Tritium recovery should prove considerably simpler if molten salts
are used; this is particularly true if the tritium can be maintained as
TF to minimize diffusion through metallic walls.

Several of the physical properties of lithium (thermal conductivity,
specific heat, viscosity and melting point, for example) are superior to
those of the molten salt. However, since the magnetic field will prevent
turbulent flow in the blanket for lithium, but not for the salt, it may
be that the molten salt is a better heat transfer medium for such a CTR.

Lithium is compatible with relatively few structural metals, niobium
alloyed with 19% zirconium appears to be a suitable container (35). More-

over, lithium reacts with graphite, and this material must certainly be
25

clad if it is to serve in a lithium-cooled blanket assembly. Molten
LiyBeF, is compatible with graphite and with a wide variety of structural
metals. Corrosion by the salt is possible, through interaction with
strong magnetic fields, but such corrosion can apparently be avoided by
careful design. Transmutations within the salt, which provide potential
for corrosive reactions, can be accommodated by relatively simple means.

Reactions of salts with steam or with air produce accelerated
corrosion but, unlike similar reactions of lithium, lead to no inherently
hazardous conditions.

It is clearly not possible at this stage of the technology to predict
with confidence how the problems inherent in use of molten salts (or of
lithium) will be solved. It is entirely possible that both lithium and
molten salts will be useful. At any event, and regardless of the ultimate
choice, it is clear that many fascinating chemical research and develop-

ment ventures lie ahead.
