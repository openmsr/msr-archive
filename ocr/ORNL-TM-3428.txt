ESTIMATED COST OF ADDING A THIRD SALT-CIRCULATING SYSTEM FOR
CONTROLLING TRITIUM MIGRATION IN THE 1000-MW(e) MSBR

 

Roy C. Robertson

ABSTRACT

Controlling tritium migration to the steam system of
the 1000-MW(e) reference design MSBR power station by
interposing a KNOz-NaNO;-NaNOz salt-circulating system to
chemically trap the tritium would add about $13 million
to the total of $206 million now estimated as the cost of
the reference plant if Hastelloy N is used to contain the
7LiF-BeF, salt employed to transport heat from the fuel
salt to the nitrate-nitrite salt, and about $10 million
if Incoloy could be used. The major expenses assoclated
with the modification are the costs of the additional
heat exchangers ($9 million), the additional pumps ($5
million), and the ’LiF-BeFz inventory ($4.8 million).
Some of the expense is offset by elimination of some
equipment from the feedwater system ($2 million), through
use of less expensive materials in the steam generators
and reheaters (about $2 million), and through an improved
thermal efficiency of the plant (worth about $1 million).
In addition to acting as an effective tritium trap the
third circulating system would make accidental mixing of
the fuel and secondary salts of less consequence and
would simplify startup and operation of the MSBR. A
simplified flowsheet for the modified plant, a cell lay-
out showing location of the new equipment, physical prop-
erties of the fluids, design data and cost estimates for
the new and modified equipment are presented.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Controlling tritium migration to the steam system of the 1000-MW(e)
reference design MSER power station by interposing salt-circulating loops
to chemically trap the tritium would add 4 to 6% to the total plant cost.
The net increase in capital cost of the plant, including indirect costs,
is about $13 million if Hastelloy N is used to contain the 7LiF-BeFy
salt employed as the heat transport fluid in the secondary system, and
about $10 million if Incoloy could be used. These increases would apply
to a cost for the reference design plant now estimated at about $206
million (based on early 1970 costs). Addition of the loops would in-
crease the power production costs by 0.2-0.3 mills/kwhr, making the
total cost about 5.5 mills/kWhr.

As shown in the cost summary, Table 1, the major portion of the
cost of modifying the design is due to the additional heat exchangers
and pumps required, and to the relatively high cost of the ?Li-bearing
secondary salt. There were also increases in the cost of the primary
heat exchangers and in the fuel-salt inventory. However, the added
third loops use a nitrate-nitrite heat transport salt which permits
savings in the material costs in the steam generators and reheaters.

Use of this salt also permits reductions in the feedwater and cold re-
heat steam temperatures, and through changes in the steam system flow-
sheet and the auxiliary electric load, produces a reduction of costs
equivalent to a plant investment of about $800,000. Credit for these
savings was taken in the net costs mentioned above.

In addition to serving as an effective tritium trap, the third
loops offer other important advantages over the reference design. These
are features which, in general, could not have cost credits assigned.
For example, the similarity of the fuel and secondary salts makes mixing
due to leaks in the primary heat exchanger of far less consequence than
in the reference design. Startup and operation of the MSER would be
simplified because of changes that could be made in the steam system

flowsheet.

1. INTRODUCTION

Tritium formed in the MSBR fuel salt must be prevented from reaching
the steam system. The problem is difficult because of the relative ease
with which hydrogen diffuses through most metals at MSBER operating tem-
peratures. Studies are being made at ORNL of several different methods
of tritium control; of these, the introduction of a third salt-circulating
system to chemically trap the tritium between the secondary salt and the
steam system is the only one well within present technology and, on the
basis of present knowledge, offers assured confinement of the tritium.

It is possibly one of the most expensive of the control methods being con-
sidered, however, and raises the question as to whether its use would add
prohibitively to the cost of a molten-salt reactor power station.

This study evaluates the various cost factors involved in adding
the third salt-circulating system to the 1000-MW(e) MSBR reference design
described in ORNL-4541.% The cost estimating methods follows those used
in that report. The costs of modifying the reference design include the
capital cost of the extras equipment, the salt inventories, and also reflect
the cost effects of the new designs for the heat transfer equipment made
necessary by the use of heat transfer fluids different from those used in
the reference concept. (The calculations for the new and modified heat
exchangers were made by C. E. Bettis et al., using essentially the same
computer programs as were used in the reference design.) The cost esti-
mates also take credit for the equipment not needed in the feedwater
system of the modified plant and for the improved thermal efficiency of
the station, as explained below.

The reference MSBR design uses circulating sodium fluorcborate,
NaF-NaBF,, to transport heat to the steam generators and reheaters, whereas
the modified design uses a nitrate-nitrite heat transfer salt, KNOz-NaNOs-
NaNO; (known commercially as "Hitec"), to heat the steam equipment. This

has five important advantages: (1) any hydrogen diffusing into the salt

Salt Breeder Reactor, ORNL-L541 (May 1971).

 
would combine with the oxygen and subsequently be drawn off as steam and
collected, forming an effective tritium trap; (2) the salt is not corro-
sive to less expensive materials of construction, allowing Incoloy 800,
or a similar material, to be substituted for the Hastelloy N used in the
reference design; (3) its low melting temperature of 288°F permits use of
conventional feedwater and cold reheat temperatures in the steam system
and eliminates the need for the reheat steam preheaters, the pressure-
booster pumps and mixing chambers used in the reference design; (4)
startup of the system is simplified and the auxiliary boiler probably
does not need to be a supercritical-pressure unit as in the reference
plant; and (5) the salt has a low cost of only about 15 cents/1b. The
salt does not react exothermically with water and it has good flow and
heat transfer properties.

The modified design would use a ’"LiF-BeF, salt to transport heat
from the fuel salt to the nitrate-nitrite salt. With the exception of
the uranium and thorium components, this salt is the same as the fuel
salt, and thus a leak in the primary heat exchanger would be of far less
consequence than in the reference design where dissimilar salts would mix.
The 7LiF-BeFy is not corrosive to materials less expensive than Hastelloy
N, provided that no moisture is present. One cost estimate in this study
has been made using Hastelloy N for the secondary system and another
using Incoloy. Due to the lithium-7 content, the cost of the salt is
relatively high -- about $12/10. Its resale value at the end of the
30-year plant life has been taken into account, although the effect is
not great.

The reference MSBR design consists of a single reactor supplying
heat to four primary circulating loops, each containing a salt-circulating
pump and a heat exchanger. The coolant-salt system contains four loops,
with each containing a salt-circulating pump, four steam generators and
two reheaters. This arrangement was not altered in the modified design,
although there was some adjustment of the temperatures. The interposed
salt-circulating system would consist of four loops, each containing a
circulating pump and a heat exchanger. The following terminology has been

adopted.
Fuel salt to "LiF-BeFy; heat exchanger ~~ Primary heat exchanger
Li¥F~BeFy; to KWNO5;-NaNO,-NaNOs exchanger --~ Secondary heat exchanger
KNO,-NaNOg -NaNOa to steam exchangers -~ Steam generator or

steam reheater
Fuel-salt circulating pump ~~ Primary pump
LiF-BeF; circulating pump -~ Secondary pump
KNOz-NaNOgz-NaNO4 circulating pump -~ Tertiary pump

This study is primarily concerned with evaluating the cost effects
of adding the third salt-circulating loops. The concept was not carried
further than to indicate general feasibility and to provide a basis for
cost estimates. No effort was made toward optimization.

In comparing the cost of the MSBR modified with the third loops
to the reference design cost estimates, it was necessary to make some re-
visions to the latter as reported in ORNL-4541. The heat transfer equip-
ment design data have undergone two relatively recent revisions. The
first was made in time to be tabulated with the design data in the latest
distributed draft of the report, but, because of the extensive changes
required and the fact that at the time the influence on costs appeared
to be small, the cost estimates were not adjusted accordingly. The
second revision, which applied only to the primary heat exchanger, was
made just in time for the data to be changed before the report was
printed, but, again, the cost estimates could not be revised. All of
the revisions tended to increase costs, however, and when the cost esti-
mates were revised in this study it was found that in aggregate they
amounted to about $4 million, including the indirect charges. The total
capital cost of the reference design MSER is thus about $206 million
rather than the $202 million given in ORNL-4541. Both amounts are based
on the early 1970 value of the dollar.

2. DESCRIPTION OF MSBR MODIFIED WITH THIRD LOOPS

A simplified flowsheet for the 1000-MW(e) MSBR station as modified
to include the third salt-circulating loops is shown in Fig. 1. It can
be noted that the temperatures have been adjusted from those used in the

reference design and that there were corresponding changes in the mass

flow rates of the salts. The flow quantities shown on the flowsheet are
for each of the four circulating loops.
The secondary heat exchangers and the associated LiF-BeFg; pumps

can be arranged in the reactor cell without changing the dimensions of
the containment structure, as indicated in Fig. 2. The layout provides
relatively short piping between the primary and secondary heat exchangers
to keep the lithium-7 inventory low. No major changes would be required
in the salt piping to the steam generators and reheaters. On this basis,
the cost estimates for the modified system do not include any expenses

for modification of the building or cell structure.

3. HEAT TRANSFER EQUIPMENT

The physical properties of interest for the fuel and heat-transport
salts are given in Table 2. (Sodium fluoroborate has been included for
comparison, although not used in the modified MSBR system. )

The costs of the heat transfer equipment were based on the estimated
weights of the various shapes of materials used in fabrication, and on a
unit price which reflects the costs of fabrication, inspection, trans-
portation, and installation ready for use. The total installed costs of
Hastelloy N and Incoloy 800, as used in this study, are listed in Table
3. As in the reference design, the base prices of materials can be deter-
mined with relatively good certainty, but the additions to provide the
total installed cost greatly overshadow the basic material cost in impor-
tance and also involve considerable intuitive judgment. As a rough check
on the reasonableness of the cost estimates, the costs per square foot of

heat transfer surface are compared in Table 10.

1. Primary Heat Exchangers

 

The cost estimate for the primary heat exchangers in the reference
design, as reported in ORNL-4541, has been changed from $7.3 million to
about $8.7 million to reflect the revisions to the design data, as indi-
cated in Table 4. The cost increase is also due to adding in the cost
of the baffles and to inclusion of the double-pipe coolant-salt nozzles,

which had previously been assumed to be covered by the piping cost

stated in ORNL-45L41 applied to the inner liner rather than to the
outer shell.

The design data for the primary heat exchangers as modified to use
LiF-BeFz; on the shell side are also shown in Table 4. These design
data have not been recalculated using the May 1971 revisions to the com-
puter program (see Introduction), but the effects of the changes could
be estimated by using their influence on the reference design primary
heat exchanger costs as a guide, as follows: tubes (+6.4%), shell and
liner (+8.7%), heads (—1.4%), rings (~1.0%), downcomers, U-bends and
baffles (+4.1%).

The tubes and other portions of the primary heat exchanger in con-
tact with the fuel salt must be constructed of Hastelloy N. This was
also true in the reference design for the portions in contact with the

sodium fluoroborate salt. In the modified design, however, consideration

can be given to use of less expensive materials in the shell side of the
system, provided that no moisture is present. The more conservative
approach is to use Hastelloy N for all portions of the secondary system,
and this is the basis for the ccst estimates shown in Part A of Tables
1, 4, and 5. Since there has been noteworthy success in excluding water
from salt systems, however, it may be practical to use Incoloy, or a
similar material, in the secondary system. The estimated costs in this
case are shown in Part B of Tables 1, 4, and 5. It will be noted that
use of Incoloy would save about $3 million in total costs when indirect

charges are included.

optimized, however, and although sufficient for cost-estimating purposes,
there are indications that further study may be needed. For example,

the calculated shell diameter of over 60 in. is questionable for the U-
shell configuration. The tube size needs optimizing in that the 3/8-in.-
OD tubing is needed to minimize the LiF-BeF, inventory and surface re-
quirements, but it is relatively expensive compared to larger sizes (see
Table 3). Consideration could be given to use of eight units rather than
four, and to use of straight-tube designs, although space in the cell is
somewhat limited.

As previously discussed, there is a possible option in selecting
materials to be used on contact with the LiF-BeFz; salt. Part A of Table
5 shows the estimated direct cost of the secondary heat exchangers if
constructed with Hastelloy N tubes and heads, and Part B indicates the

cost if Incoloy is used for these parts.

3. Steam Generators

The cost estimate for the steam generators in the reference design
was changed from $6.3 million to $7.2 million to reflect the revisions
in the design data. The principal differences were due to an increase
in the number and length of the tubes and an increase in the thickness
of the tube sheets used in the cost estimate. The data and costs are
shown in Table 6.

The design data and the estimated cost of the steam generators for
the modified MSBR system using KNOz-NaNOg-NaNOg; on the shell side are
also shown in Table 6. The lower total cost of the units for the modi-
fied design is primarily due to use of Incoloy rather than Hastelloy N.
It may be noted that the steam generators are designed for 555°F enter-
ing feedwater rather than the 551°F temperature called for in the flow-
sheets. A technicality in the computer program made it necessary to
revise the number, but since the total amount of heat to be transferred
was not altered, the only sacrifice to accuracy was relatively small

velocity effects.

4. Steam Reheaters

The estimated cost of the steam heaters in the reference design
was revised from $1.7 million to $1.6 million to correspond to the re-
vised design data, as shown in Table 7. Although the revised unit has
more surface, the previously used price of Hastelloy N tubing did not
reflect the lower unit price of 3/k-in.-0D tubing as compared to 3/8-
in.-0D tubing.

The design data and estimated cost of the modified reheaters using
KNNOz-NaNOy -NaNOa on the shell side are also shown in Table 7. Using
Incoloy rather than Hastelloy N accounted for the reduction in cost to
$1.2 million. It will be noted that the unit is designed for 550°F
entering cold reheat temperature, as taken directly from the high-pressure

turbine exhaust.

5. Reheat Steam Preheaters

 

Reheat steam preheaters were used in the reference design to heat
the high-pressure turbine exhaust from 550°F to 650°F before the steam
entered the reheaters to avoid possible problems of coolant-salt freezing.
The cost of the preheaters was underestimated in the reference design
report because the thickness of the spherical heads was used in the cal-
culations as 1/2-in. rather than the correct value of 2-1/2 in. Further,
the material costs assumed for the Croloy in the reference design appeared
too low. The revised cost estimate for the preheaters is now $924,000,
as shown in Table 8.

The preheater design was not optimized. Use of 3/8-1in. tubes may
involve a cost penalty, and some improvement in costs might be obtained
if the number of units was increased.

The modified MSER with the third loops added to trap tritium does
not require use of preheaters because of the low liquidus temperature of

the nitrate-nitrite salt.

6. General Effects of Revising and Modifying the Heat Transfer
Equipment

 

The total cost effects of revising the design data for the heat
transfer equipment in the reference design are summarized in Table 9.

results in raising the total estimated plant cost of the reference design
MSER plant from about $202 million to $206 million.

Use of Incoloy rather than Hastelloy N for the portions of the second-
ary system in contact with LiF-BeF, would save about $1.6 million in the
total cost (including indirect charges) of the primary heat exchangers,
about $1.3 million for the secondary heat exchangers, and about $200,000
for the secondary salt piping, for a total savings of about $3 million.

The costs of the heat transfer equipment on a square foot basis are
compared in Table 10. While the values are not particularly conclusive,
they indicate that the estimated costs are generally within reason for

this type of nuclear power station equipment.

4. SALT-CIRCULATING PUMPS

Since salt-circulating pumps of the size required for the 1000-MW(e)

MSER station have never been fabricated, the cost-estimating method used

in this study and in the reference design report is based on published
costs of similar pumps (as adjusted for capacity and head requirements),
on MSRE pump cost experience, and on the basis of considerable intuitive
Judgment. Table 11 indicates the pumping requirements which served as

a basis for assuming allowances for the pump costs in the modified MSER
plant.

Use of the third circulating salt system would add four pumps of
about 2700 hp each, would reduce the power requirements of another set
of four pumps from 3200 hp to 1800 hp each, and would eliminate the
need for the two 6000-hp each pressure-booster pumps in the feedwater
system. As shown in Table 12, the connected load of the pump motors is
reduced by a total of about 5,400 kW(e) in the modified system. If it
is assumed that all the pumping energy is usefully converted to heat,
about 5,400 kW(t) is thus not available in the modified system for con-
version into electric power at the average overall plant efficiency of
4h. L%. The net savings in auxiliary electric load is thus about 3,000
xW(e). With power worth 5.3 mills/kWhr, and 80% plant factor, this
amounts to about $111,000/ year. At 13.7% fixed charges, the savings is
equivalent to a plant investment of about $817,000. Credit for this has
been taken in Parts A and B of Table 1.

5. SALT INVENTORY COSTS

The modified primary heat exchangers will contain about 56 ft2
more fuel salt than those used in the reference design, as indicated in
Table 13. On the basis of the $57/1b fuel-salt cost used in ORNL-L541,
this amounts to an additional investment of $671,000 for the MSBR plant.
Following the procedures used in the reference report, however, this
capital cost is not included in the plant capital cost but in the fuel-
cycle cost. This would increase the fuel-cycle cost by about 0.013
mills/kWhr. (In both the reference and the modified plant designs it
was assumed that the cleanup costs for the fuel salt at the end of the
30-year plant life would be great enough to make it have essentially no
resale, or "ecrap” value.)

The estimated price of the nitrate~nitrite salt used in the modified
design is 15 cents/1b as compared to 50 cents/1b for the sodium fluoro-
borate used in the reference design. Both of these salts are assumed to
have no resale value at end of the useful life of the plant.

As shown in Table 1k, the estimated volume of the LiF-BeF, used in
the secondary system is about 3200 £18. Almost three-fourths of this is
in the shell-side of the primary heat exchangers. Using the same prices
as in ORNL-L45L1, where 7Li is assumed to cost $120/kg, and ?LiF and BeFy
to cost $16.50 and $7.50/1b, respectively, the estimated cost of "LiF-BeFg
is about $12/1v. The total estimated cost of the secondary salt inventory
is about $4,800,000, as shown in Table 13. It is assumed that the salt
will last the lifetime of the plant without reprocessing or replacement
costs. At the end of 30 years it is assumed that the salt will have a
resale value of 50%, or $6/1b. (The salt could be used as the secondary
coolant in another MSER or as the carrier to meke up new batches of fuel
salt.) The present worth of $2,400,000 thirty years hence at 8% interest
is $239,000, and credit for this has been taken in Table 1.
