LIQUID-LIQUID IMMISCIBILITY
IN THE SYSTEM LiF-BeF -Z/F

H. A. Friedman R. E. Thoma
Beryllium fluoride systems have been of interest
“weakened models’! of Si0,
The weakened model contains cations
and anions of the same radius as those in the
silicate system, but with half the ionic charge. In
MgO-Si0,, a liquid immiscibility region is found,
in the weakened model LiF-BeF , this has not been
found, although metastable glasses, mutually in-
soluble, are encountered at 60 to 90 mole % BeF, ,
where the melts are highly viscous. Our recent
work on the LiF-BeF -ZiF, system? reveals that
stable liquid-liquid regions do exist in this ternary,
although they do not extend stably to the LiF-Bel
binary.

Silicate and BeF glasses are structurally anal-
ogous and are composed of networks of bridging
ions, oxide and fluoride ions respectively. Other
cations, particularly the low valent ones, if added
to these glasses, break the bridges and are referred
to as modifiers; their effect on viscosity is quite

Our liquid-liquid immiscibility studies were made
with a new high-temperature centrifuge that devel-
oped a centrifugal force of 530 x ¢ and gave good
layer separation in sealed metal capsules. Results

were based on chemical analyses of portions of
quenched samples obtained after 1-hr periods at
elevated temperature in the centrifuge. In pre-
liminary trials with PbO-B 0, glasses, good agree-
ment was obtained with the work of Geller and
Bunting.” Isothermal tie lines at 550, 650, and
700°C for the immiscibility region in LiF-Bel  -
ZF | are shown in Fig. 1.1.

The possibility of stable liquid-liquid immis-
cibility in the LiF-BeF , system was given special
attention. This was in part prompted by results on
the chemical activity of BeF, as a function of
composition in the LiF-Bef, binary, as obtained
from HF-H,0 equilibria,* where there was an
indication that immiscibility might occur for 80
mole % Bel, at temperatures above 700°C.

Ten samples representing six binary composi-
tions in the range from 80 to 34 mcle % Bel, were
centrifuged and examined; no phase separation was
found. Further, visual observations of an 80 mole
7% BeF, melt were made under helium in a glove
box and furnace assembly by Cantor and Ward.’
Again the liquid was single phase, although on the
initial heating to 700°C a lower viscous layer and
a thinner, easily stirred, upper layer persisted;
only after heating to 850°C did the melt become
homogeneous. The melt remained homogeneous
through subsequent temperature cycles from room
temperature to 850°C. The conclusion was reached
that there is no stable immiscibility above the
liguidus in the LiF-Bel", binary.

of the recently completed investigation of the
sodium fluoride—lanthanide trifluoride systems (see
“Compositional Variability in Sodium Fluoride—
Lanthanide Fluoride Complex Compounds,” this
report), it became evident that within the series
cation charge density was beginning to obscure the
effect of size. It was therefore of great interest to
obtain information concerning the comparative
phase behavior among the following group of sys-
tems, which are ranked below in order of increasing
difference of the tripositive cation to alkali cation
radius ratio:

NaF-LaF 0.923

The phase 3NaF-ScF, undergoes a strongly
exothermal solid-state inversion when cooled below

twinned material. Single crystals of the low-
temperature form of 3Nakl -ScF, were obtained by
growth from NaF-ScF, mixtures of 70-30 mole %
composition. X-ray diffrac tion analysis of these
single crystals indicated that they are of mono-
clinic symmetry (see “Crystallographic Data on
New Compounds,®’ this report) and are isomorphous
with cryolite. A high-temperature form of cryolite
is reported’ to occur as a face-centered cubic

We believe that the greater resemblance of the
system NaF-ScF to NaF-AlF, rather than to
NaF-LuF arises as a result of the lanthanide
contraction, producing the Lu?" ion of extra-
ordinarily high charge density. Quantitative rela-
tionships of the combined effects of ion size and
charge density have been developed by Dietzel. 19
They require accurate information of interionic
distances, which for these complex fluorides must
await determination of the crystal structures.

Investigation of the sodium fluoride—lanthanide
trifluoride systems'® has been completed. A
salient feature of the NaF-LnF , binary systems
is the unusual behavioral sequence produced by
the compositional variability of the fluorite-like
phases. This behavior shows the remarkable effect
of cation size and polarizability in lanthanide
systems. As shown in Table 1.2, the cubic phase
is not formed at all in the systems NaF-LaF and

NaF-CeF , is formed by NaF and PrF,, and is
extended to an increasingly broad composition
range throughout the rest of the system sequence.
A trend also develops toward broadening the com-
position limits and extension of the temperature
range through which the cubic and orthorhombic
phases are stable. The trends toward increasing
number, compositional variability, and stability of
the NaF-LnF , crystal phases appear to be dis-
tinct, not only with respect to the crystal chem-
istry of the complex compounds, but also in their
modes of crystallization. No satisfactory theory
has as yet been developed to explain the quanti-
tative aspects of compositional variability of
NaF-LnF , phases. Qualitatively, the trends are
believed to indicate an increase in the lattice
energies of the crystalline phases resulting from
the lanthanide contraction and a corresponding
decrease in polarizability. The decrease in polar-
izability is probably the most influential factor in
enabling compositional variability of the phases to
be extended with increasing atomic number of the
lanthanide. As represented by the Lorentz-Lorenz
equation, molar refraction approximates the volume
occupied by the constituent ions in crystalline
phases. A measure of the crystal free space can
therefore be estimated from the difference between
molar volume, as computed from unit-cell dimen-
sions, and the molar refraction.

As the atomic
small increases in the free
space fraction are noted for the lanthanide tri-
fluorides and for the hexagonal NaF - LnF , phases.
A more pronounced increase in free space fraction
is found for the fluorite-like Nal'-LnF | phases,

with an even greater increase in the free space
fraction for the equimolar cubic phases than for the
cubic SNaF *9LnF , phases as Z increases. Sub-
stitutional solid solution of Ln®” into the fluorite
unit cell gives rise to cation vacancies but is
partly compensated by filling of interstitial posi-
tions with fluoride ions, as described by Roy and
Roy.'? The fact that the free space fraction
occupied by the ions in the cubic structure at the
5NaF - 9LnF saturation limit is even greater than
at the equimolar composition lends additional
evidence to the validity of the previous interstitial
fluorine model for solution mechanism.

We conclude that the combined effect of the
reduction in polarizability of the lanthanide ions
and the increase in free space within the crystal
lattice is to reduce the specificity of Na’ and
Ln®*" ions with regard to the cation sites they

occupy in fluorite-like, orthorhombic, and hexagonal

increase observed in compositional variability of
the crystal phases in the NaF-LnF systems with
increasing atomic number of the lanthanide.

Equilibrations of the oxides with fluoride melts
have since been completed for temperatures up to
1150°C. The oxide solids from these latter equil-
ibrations were not only examined by x-ray and
petrographic techniques as before, but also these
and all of the previously equilibrated solids have
been chemically analyzed io determine the U-Zr
composition of the individual phases. (The separa-
tion of the phases was performed using hot nitric
acid, a liquid in which UO, is readily soluble and
2x0, is virtually insoluble.)

Incorporation of this new informalion gave the
more detailed diagram for the U0 ,-Zt0, system
shown in Fig. 1.3. The monoclinic-tetragonal
transformation of the Z:0 rich solid solutions
occurred at 1110 + 5°C. At this temperature

%, while UO, is soluble in monoclinic ZiO, to
about 0.15 mole %, and in tetragonal ZrO, to about
1.0 mole %.
temperature for pure ZrO, has been given by
Mumpton and Roy?? as 1170°C. No attempt was
made to determine this inversion temperature in
the present work. However, microscopic investiga-
tion of a sample of pure ZrO, equilibrated at
1190°C has shown that it definitely had been
tetragonal. Hence, the Mumpton and Roy value of
1170°C falls within our limits of 1110 to 1190°C.

Below the transition temperature of 1110°C, the
saturating solids are the cubic UO ,-rich and the
monoclinic ZrO -rich solid solutions.

The monoclinic-tetragonal transition

However,
even at 1110°C, these solid solutions are very
dilute. Moreover, it is expected that the solubil-
ities will decrease exponentially as the tempera-
ture is reduced. Hence, for all practical purposes,
the equilibrium solids at lower temperatures are
the pure phase materials, that is, pure uo, and
pure 2:0,

We believe the differences in the results reported
here and those reported previously by others
reflect the inability of the other investigators to
obtain equilibrium products at temperatures below
1600°C solely via solid-state reactions. These
temperatures are more than a thousand degrees
below the melting points of the pure oxides. At
such relatively temperatures, solid-state
reactions of the oxides should be very slow. In
the present investigation the use of a fused fluo-
ride phase provided a path by which the slowness
of the solid-state reaction could be overcome and
equilibrium could be achieved.

THE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE
OF LiUF,

G. D. Brunton

The compound LiUF _ was originally described
as Li UF, in the molten-salt system LiF-

UF, .227%8 The crystal structure was determined
in order to resolve the stoichiometry and because
LiUF (is the uranium salt which would be deposited
if fuel should freeze in the Molten-Salt Reactor
Experiment.

Tetragonal LillF crystallizes in space group
14 /a with a = 14.884 + 0.002 A and c = 6.5467 +
0.0003 A. The calculated density is 6.23 g/cc
with 16 formula weights per unit cell.
parameters are listed in Table 1.3.

Figure 1.4 is an illustration of two asymmetric
units of LiUF | related by a center of symmetry —
approximately one-eighth of a unit cell.

Each uranium is surrounded by
ions which form the corners of a
14-faced polyhedron having the form of a prism
with triangular bases and with a four-faced pyramid
on each of the three prism faces. Each lithium
ion is surrounded by six fluorine ions at the corners
of a distorted octahedron.

The structure of LiUF | consists of 16 uranium-
containing polyhedra and 16 lithium-containing
octahedra linked together so that every uranium
polyhedron shares an end with its centrosym-
metrical neighbor, shares corners with five other
uranium polyhedra, and shares a face, an edge,
and two corners, respectively, with four lithium
octahedra. Each lithium octahedron shares edges
with three other lithium octahedra, and shares
an edge, a face, and two corners, respectively,
with four uranium polyhedra. This linkage gives
spiraling cross-connected chains parallel to the
Cc axis.

X-ray precession photographs were used to
establish that the crystals were orthothombic with

REFINEMENT OF THE CRYSTAL
STRUCTURE OF (NH) MnF

D. R. Sears

The manganic ion is unstable with respect to
disproportionation, and as a consequence, simple
salts of trivalent manganese ate rare. Neverthe-
less, it is desirable to collect definitive informa-
tion on the structures of manganic salts when
possible, for complex anions containing trivalent
manganese can be expected to exhibit significant
crystal field effects. In particular, octahedrally

14

coordinated Mn3" should be tetragonally distorted
as a result of the Jahn-Teller effect.?®

The compound (NH) MnkF_ crystallizes in the
centrosymmetric orthorhombic space group D}o-
Pama, with a = 6.20 + 0.03, b = 7.94 £ 0.01, and
c = 10.72 + 0.01 A. Excellent photographic and
spectrometric zonal x-ray intensity data were
collected in 1957 from specimens of (NH,),MnF
prepared by T. S. Piper. The data had resulted in
but it had not been
possible to perform a satisfactory refinement with
the computing facilities available then. The
opportunity arose to perform a modern full matrix
anisotropic with the
existing AOI and Ok! intensity data, using a modifi-
cation of the Busing-Martin-Levy program ORFLS.3°
Anomalous dispersion effects were included in the
calculations.

a high coordination number of nitrogen (7 to 9) and
the infrared spectrum?? of (NH) Ma suggest
strongly that N-H-IF hydrogen bonding is absent
ot very weak.

The bond distances and angles involving man-
ganese reveal that there is indeed a pronounced
tetragonal distortion of the octahedral manganese
coordination shell. Doubtless, sharing of the F
atoms between adjacent octahedra contributes to
the substantial elongation of the ¥n-F_ bonds, but
a Jahn-Teller distortion must contribute signifi-
cantly. However, quantitative separation of the
effects is not practicable.

Dingle’? has discussed both the crystal spectrum
of (NH J MoE and the solution spectrum of trivalent
manganese in concentrated HE with excess 7,
presumed to contain Mal ®7. The nearly perfect
correspondence of the spectra in the 10,000 to
28,000 cm™! region suggests that tetragonally
distorted MoF 3+ octahedra appear in solution;
such a distortion in aqueous MnF °~ solutions
surely cannot result from chain formation. We
infer that the distortion arises largely from ligand
field effects in solution and, by extension, does
so also in the crystal.

HIGH- TEMPERATURE X-RAY STUDIES

A Materials Research Corporation high-tempera-
ture x-ray diffractometer furnace has been employed
in several studies of phase change at elevated
temperatures, with the following results.

The orthorhombic lanthanide trifluorides SmF
through LuF ; and YF, have been shown to undergo
a phase transition below their melting points.® Of
these compounds, SmF through HoF , invert to
the hexagonal LaF, structure while YF, and Ed,
through LuF invert to a crystalline form which
is probably hexagonal but whose unit-cell dimen-
sions suggest that it is different from the LaF,

Phase equilibrium studies in the UO,-Z:O,
system have been continued, the principal objects
being: (1) to investigate the composition-tempera-
ture region in which Thoma’! has postulated the
existence of a compound of approximate composi-
tion UO,-3Z:0,; (2) to furnish x-ray diffraction
data for the continuing fluoride-flux equilibration
experiments of Romberger, Stone, and Baes;*?
and (3) to develop
constant—composition relationships for the sys-
tem UO, (cubic)-ZrO (cubic).

Tentative results to date suggest that the sys-
tem cubic UO ,—cubic Z¢0, at room temperature

room-temperature lattice-

displays a linear relationship between a, and
mole fraction Zo, at least to 50% Zr0,. The

data can be extrapolated to a, = 5.08 A at 100%
Zt0,, in reasonable agreement with the results
obtained by extrapolation of the CeO,-Z:O, data
(5.11 A) due to Duwez and Odell. ??

Attempts to establish the existence of a compound
of composition near UO, 3Zr0O, above 1600°C
have not been successful. We have not obtained
pure tetragonal starting material near this mole
ratio. X-ray diffraction experiments in the temper-
ature range 1400 to 1650°C at a Z:0,:U0, ratio
of 1.36, using a pure tetragonal solid-solution
starting material, have resulted in exsolution, to
form nearly pure cubic UO, and tetragonal ZrO ,-
UO, solid solution richer in ZrO.

Our high-temperature diffractometer attachment
is being modified extensively to permit operation
at higher temperatures in better vacuum and to
diminish problems in window opacity caused by
filament and sample volatilization.

Some high-temperature x-ray diffraction meas-
urements were made in order to relate our single-
crystal study of Li AlF to the reported? poly-

corresponds to the ? fluorine, which is
indeed contained in a polyhedron of six Zr atoms
bridged by F atoms. The large motion of this
F atom means that either it is rattling about quite
freely or else there is a statistical disorder in
which this atom is bonded randomly to one of the
six Zr atoms at a time. The ‘‘extra’’ Na atom is
Na(2); it is closely coordinated by six F neighbors
and by six additional F neighbors at a little greater
distence. Each Zr atom has eight F atoms about
it and each Na(1l) has seven F atoms.

OXIDE CHEMISTRY OF LiF.Bef -ZrF MELTS

In previously reported studies of the oxide

method! for the following reactions:

Reactions (1) and (2) were of interest because of
their role in the contamination of molten fluorides
with oxide, their role in the removal of oxides by
HF during salt purification, and, more recently,
because of their use in oxide analysis.? Reaction
(3) has been of interest because it relates the
thermodynamic propesties of the dissolved fluoride

MO. (s), 1,04), and HF(g). Estimates of the

However, these estimates have been of limited
accuracy because of the difficulties in determin-
ing 25 by the transpiration method.

During the past year, a more direct method for
determining oxide solubilities has been adopted.
A measured volume of salt, presaturated by
equilibration with excess solid oxide, is filtered
through a sintered nickel filter into a heated re-
ceiving vessel, It is then sparged with an H -HF
mixture and the total amount of water evolved
determined by Karl-Fischer titration. Thus far,
essentially complete removal of oxide from the
filtered salt samples has been accomplished in
3 hr or less by use of an influent HF pressure of
0.05 atm. The blank has been equivalent to
~2 x 1073 mole/kg of oxide (32 ppm), the sensi-
tivity has been ~.5 x 107% mole/kg (8 ppm), while
the experimental values ranged from 1.5 x 107% to
1.5 x 107% mole/kg.

This method presently is being used to redeter-
mine the solubilities of ZrO, in (2LiF-BeF ) +
ZrF mixtures, which simulate MSRE fuel salt and
flush salt mixtures. The results obtained thus far
are compared in Fig. 2.1 with previously reported’
estimates based on measured values of the ratio
05/94, in such salt mixtures. When completed,
these measurements should permit the establish
ment of more reliable tolerance limits for oxide

levels in the MSRE and in future molten-salt
reactors. In addition, the more accurate solubility
values — when combined with Q,, values [reaction

(3)] — should yield correspondingly more reliable
values of Q_. These will be useful in optimizing
oxide removal procedures during salt purification
and salt analysis.

provided adequate fit to the data (A and B are
constants). The data are summarized in Table
2,3. The constants for each equation were ob-
tained by the method of least squares. Isotherms
at 1000 and 1100°C are shown in Fig, 2.3.

To obtain some notion of the vapor species,
vapor was collected in the tubes of the vessel at
the conclusion of vapor pressure measurements
for several compositions. Chemical analysis
showed only traces of lithium ion in condensates
where the composition of the melt was 75 or
greater mole % BeF . For melts with 70 or less
mole % BeF , considerable quantities of lithium
were found in the condensates. All that may be
concluded from these analyses is (1) at greater
than 75 mole % BeF ,, the vapor is virtually pure
BeF , and (2) at less than 70 mole % Bel", the
vapor becomes more complicated; the vapor probe
ably contains the compounds LiBeF, and

Li BeF,.?? The only activity coefficients that
may be calculated from these data alone are those
of Bel at melt concentrations of 75 mole % or
greater in Bel . For these concentrations the
activity coefficients of BeF at temperatures of
1000 and 1100°C were found to be greater than
unity (varying between 1.02 and 1.10), These
values of the activity coefficient are in reason
able accord with results of the H,0-HF equilibrae
tion studies?! of the LiF-BeF system.

Manometric vapor pressures were also measured
for the MSRE fuel solvent (composition: 64.7-
30.1-5.2 mole % LiF-BeF -ZrF ) in the tempera~
ture range 960 to 1167°C. The data fit the equa-
tion log p(mm) = 8.803 — 9936/T(°K).

only slight curvature; hence, BeF, is Arrhenius.
Usually the physical behavior of Bef, is analogous
to that of 5i0,. Macedo and Litovitz?® postulated
that the Arrhenius behavior of 5i0, is due to the
constancy of density with temperature which, in
turn, means that the free volume of 310, does not

measurements of Bel are a difficult experimental
task; nevertheless, we are currently considering
methods for measuring the density of pure BeF .

liminary measurements were begun to determine
the viscosities of fluoroborates. The first measure-
ments were made on NaBF ; the results were:
7 + 2 centipoises at 466°C and 14 1% 3 centipoises
at 436°C. The precision is poor because the
Brookfield viscometer is primarily designed to
measure higher viscosities.

No mixtures of alkali fluorides with NaBF were
measured because such melts would most likely
have been even less viscous than pure NaBF ;
the poor precision in this lower viscosity range
discouraged us from attempting further measure-
ments with the instrumentation at hand.

ESTIMATING DENSITIES OF MOLTEN
FLUORIDE MIXTURES

S. Cantor

Several years ago,?® the author, after examining
the published data on density of molten fluorides,
proposed that the simple rule of additivity of
molar volumes was very useful for estimating
densities of fluoride melts. To facilitate calcula~
tions, a table of empirical molar volumes was
derived from the published data. Since the earlier
report, there have been several experimental
studies of densities of fluoride melts. In this
report, we reexamine the previous method of esti-
mation taking into account the newer measurements.

First, it appears that the rule of additivity of mo-
lar volumes held for all binary fluoride systems
except one; the one exception was the NaF.UF
system,?’ where positive deviations from addi~
tivity were as great as 6%; the rule held in two
studies of the LiF-ThF | system?®:2? and in the
LiF-UF,,”® NaF-ThF,,”® and LiF-KF>® systems.

It was also found that the measured densities?

density measurements carried out by Sturm! on
four fluoride mixtures, the additivity estimate
differed from the experimental results by 5 to 6%
for three mixtures; the discrepancy between ex-
perimental and estimated density of fluoride mix-
tures seldom exceeds 3%. Although errors in the
molar volumes of ZrF, and KF may be responsible,
the reasons for these larger discrepancies are as

yet unresolved.

Thus, it appears that, although there may be
exceptions, the rule of additive molar volumes
describes the experimental data on molten fluorides
quite well and remains the simplest, most accurate
method for estimating densities of fluoride melts.

empirical molar volumes. The molar volumes of

ESTIMATING SPECIFIC HEATS AND THERMAL
CONDUCTIVITIES OF FUSED FLUORIDES

S. Cantor

Specific Heats

The simplest rule for estimating high-tempera-
ture heat capacities in the condensed states is
that of Dulong and Petit, in which the heat
capacity per gram~atom is approximately equal to
30

6 cal/°K. Accordingly, the experimental heat
capacities of molten fluorides were examined in
order to modify the Dulong-Petit value for molten
fluorides. The data for pure compounds (see Table
2.6) indicate that the heat capacity per grameatom
is approximately 8 cal/°K. The data for fluoride
mixtures would seem to indicate the average value
to be somewhat higher than 8. However, the heat
capacities of the mixtures are probably uncertain
by 10 to 20%, whereas the experimental uncertainty
for most of the pure compounds is less than 5%.
Hence, 8 cal (°K)”! (gram-atom)™! is the value
chosen for estimating specific heats of fluoride
melts.

The temperature variation of C_ in liquids, when
determined accurately, is very small; whether this
variation is negative or positive has not been
adequately established.

Thermal Conductivities

At present, accurate measurement of thermal
conductivities of fused fluorides is very difficult;
hence, reliable methods for estimating thermal
conductivities are extremely useful, especially if

one wishes to predict heat transfer rates in

circulating systems. Gambill®® has published an
empirical method for estimating thermal conductivi-
ties which agrees with the available data. This
report will describe a new semitheoretical method
based on Bridgman’s theory of energy transport
in liquids. *®

Bridgman proposed that energy is transferred by
collision from one molecular layer to the next at
a rate equal to the local sonic velocity and that
the distance traveled between collisions is equal
to some characteristic molecular distance. Bridge
man obtained the equation for A, the thermal con-
ductivity,

A= gs a3)

where k is Boltzmann’s constant, yp is the velocity
of sound, and A is characteristic molecular dis=
tance between collisions, To evaluate A, Bridg-
man substituted the average distance between
molecular centers, (V/N)3 (V is
volume and VN is Avogadro’s number), thus deriving

the expression
A= 3k 0) 3
= Vv ©" .

Equation (14) is in good agreement with the ex-
perimental data on covalent compounds.

the molar

(14)

However,
this equation predicts low thermal conductivities
for molten fluorides because the characteristic
collision distance is too large. The collision
distance for molten salts should be less because
the ions (the ‘‘molecular’’ entities in the liquid)
are much less compressible than covalent mole-
cules. Rather than attempt to estimate collision
distances in fused salts a priori,*! Eq. (14) was
empirically adjusted to fit the available data, the
equation obtained being:

perhaps the collision distance may be derived from
either the molecular free volume or the compressibility.

P. E. Field*? J. H. Shaffer

The solubilities of HF and DF in the molten
mixture LiF-BeF (66-34 mole %) were determined
over the temperature range 500 to 700°C and
at gas saturation pressures between 1 and 2 atm.
An extrapolation of the solubility values provides
an approximation of the solubility of tritium
fluoride in the molten fluoride mixture, The be-
havior of tritium fluoride, formed by neutron irradia-
tion of lithium, in the fluoride mixture would be of
interest in the molten-salt reactor concept as well
as in the proposed use of a molten fluoride breeder
blanket for a thermonuclear reactor.*?

The experimental procedure has been previously
described and employed for systematic studies of
gas solubilities in molten fluoride mixtures. **
Anhydrous hydrogen fluoride was obtained from a
commercial source and was used without further
purification. Anhydrous deuterium fluoride was
prepared by the Technical Division, ORGDP, by
reaction of elemental deuterium and fluorine.*®

Development of an in-pile molten-salt irradiation
assembly’ to provide supporting information for
an understanding of both short-term and long-term
effects of irradiation and fissioning on fuels and
materials for molten-salt reactors has continued
the past year. The irradiation experi-
ments are to be conducted in beam hole HN-1
of the ORR, and it is anticipated that in-pile
operation of the first experiment will begin in
the middle of calendar year 1966.

An autoclave-type (capsule) experiment with
thermally induced salt flow has been designed,
and some 4500 hr of operation have been accu-
mulated in mockup tests with two prototype as-
semblies. Test operation has been at a nominal
salt temperature of 1200°F with a salt mixture
whose composition is LiF-BeF -Z:F -UF, (65-
29-5-1 mole %, liquidus temperature ~~ 840°F).
Salt circulation rates of ~10 cm 3/min are achieved

during

by maintaining a median temperature gradient
of 100 to 180°F between the autoclave and the
cold leg. The flow rate is monitored by heat
balance measurements around the cold leg.

Results of these mockup tests indicate that
the present design of the autoclave is suitable
for use in a molten-salt irradiation program with
the irradiation objectives of (1) 200 w/cm? fuel
fission power and (2) up to 50% 23°U burnup and
long-term in-pile operation.

Earlier models of the autoclave had a horizontal

revealed that gas buildup occurred in this return

EVAPORATIVE-DISTILLATION STUDIES
ON MOL TEN-SALT FUEL COMPONENTS

M. J. Kelly

Vacuum distillation separation of molten-salt
fuel or fuel components from the rare-earth fission

products is an attractive method of decreasing
neutron losses by capture. To design process
equipment for this task, both the mass rate of
distillation and the relative volatility of the rare
earths must be known for the
system used.

demonstration for MSRE
fuel but are also directly applicable to any pro-
posed thermal MSBR fuel.

For MSRE fuel, removal of the uranium by fluo-
rination is proposed. The fuel solvent and re-
maining fission products would then be fed at
the distillation rate to a vacuum still charged
with LiF-BeF -Zi«F, at that composition which
will yield the fuel solvent as distilled product;
the rare-earth fission products would concentrate
in the still. The residue would be discarded or
processed when necessitated by heat from the
fission products or by carry over of rare earths,
A 10-ml graphite cylinder, containing ~17 g
of salt with a free surface (when molten) of 1
cm?, was used for the still pot. This cylinder
fitted in a “01” shaped INOR-8 tube heated elec-
trically to a given temperature as measured by
four thermocouples in the graphite cylinder. When
the desired temperature was reached, distillation
was initiated by evacuating the assembly. Vapor-
ized salt then passed up and over the top of
the “N17? with a small portion (attributed to thermal
reflux) collecting at the base of the graphite
cylinder. The product salt condensed in a cooler
(~ 450°C) collecting cup in the opposite leg.
Distillation was stopped by helium addition after
preselected time periods.

Mass-rate data for LiF were determined first,
and then MSRE solvent was added to the 'LiF
and distilled in aliquot portions from it. Each
repetition brought the BeF, and ZrF, conceu-
trations in the pot closer to those which would
yield fuel solvent (LiF-BelF -Zr¥ ; 65-30-5 mole
%) as product. After the equilibrium concentra-
tion was approached, 2200 ppm of neodymium

EFFECTIVE ACTIVITY COEFFICIENTS

BY EVAPORATIVE DISTILLATION
OF MOLTEN SALTS

M. J. Kelly

Evaporation into a vacuum from a quiescent
molten-salt mixture of low vapor pressure should
not permit wvapor-liquid equilibrium at the sur-
face of the melt; transport from the surface should
be controlled by the evaporation rates of the
individual components. The amount vaporized
is a function of the equilibrium vapor pressure,
molecular mass, temperature, and surface area;

Although internal consistency exists, the values

in Table 3.2.8 1°

The least-precise measurements are from MSRE-
solvent distillations; these are included to sub-
stantiate the surmise that, when ZrF, is included
in the melt, it effectively removes LiF from the
solvent, The 1000°C LiF-BeF, line has been
extended to 100 mole % LiF since the initial
LiF-BeF ,-ZtF, experiment contained <0.35 mole
% ZriF,, a quantity so small that the system
can be assumed to be LiF-BeF,. On the other
hand, as Zr¥, builds up in the mixed system
(to approximately 3 mole 9%), enhancement of
the Bek, activity is noted; this is consistent
with results from MSRE solvent (LiF-Bek -ZF ,
65-30-5 mole % initially). The temperatures re-
ported are those of the bulk melt, and it is rec-
ognized that the surface temperature may be
significantly lower, causing an indeterminate (for
the present) error. Both surface-temperature
effects and the pure LiF.ZrF, system are being
studied, It is interesting to note that the as-
sumption of unit activity coefficient for LiF does
not lead to incompatibility with the data of others.

The experiments were performed in all-nickel
vessels which did not react with HI in the pres-
ence of H, at the temperatures studied (474 to
635°C). Such reaction was avoided at the lower
temperatures of the gas exit system by use of
gold-lined nickel and Teflon tubing. The iodine
was added initially as Nal, tests were made of
the effluent gas, and HI, but no elemental io-
dine, was found. The HI was trapped in an
NaOH scrubbing solution and determined by stand-
ard jodometric methods. Only about 80% of the
initially added iodide appeared in the NaOH scrub-
ber; it is believed that the remaining iodide
escaped as a result of adsorption of HI on par-
ticulate matter which was not effectively trapped
by the scrubber. When radioactive iodine was

used in tracer experiments and a filter was
placed in the effluent gas stream just down-
stream of the reaction vessel, all the iodine

passing the filter was caught in the NaOH scrub-
ber solution and appeared as iodide ion. ‘The
discrepancy in material balance will be investi-
gated further, but it does not seem likely that
the present estimates of Q for the reaction will
be substantially altered.

tegrated rate equation which may be derived from

obtained was found not to be significantly de-
pendent on the HF flow rate (0.35 to 1.57 milli-
moles min~! kg™!), on the partial pressure of
HF (0.02 to 0.1 atm), or on the initial iodide
concentration (0.004 to 0.04 mole/kg). This

REMOVAL OF PROTACTINIUM FROM MOLTEN
FLUORIDES BY OXIDE PRECIPITATION

J. H. Shaffer
FF. A. Doss

W. K. R. Finnell
W. P. Teichert
W. R. Grimes

Since a single-region molten-salt breeder reactor
would incorporate the fertile material in the reac-
tor fuel mixture, chemical reprocessing schemes
for recovering ?%*U could be made more effective
if 4%3Pa, its precursor, could be removed with-
out alteration of the relatively large uranium
concentration in the fuel mixture. The precipi-
tation of an oxide of protactinium by the delib-
erate addition of oxide ion may provide the basis
for such a reprocessing method if the simultane-
ous precipitation of UO, can be avoided. Previ-
ous studies have demonstrated the chemical
feasibility of oxide precipitation for removing
protactinium from a fluoride mixture, LiF-BeF -
ThF, (67-18-15 mole %), proposed as the blanket
of a two-region molten-salt breeder reactor.!?

In the fluoride fuel mixture of the MSRE, suf-
ficient ZrF, has been added to accommodate
gross oxide contamination without less of uranium
from solution as UC,. Earlier studies had dem-
onstrated that UO, would not precipitate at 700°C
from the solvent, LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) with
added UF, and ZF, until the concentration
ratio of ZrF, to UF, dropped below about 1.5.1%
Therefore, a preliminary study was made of the
precipitation of PaO, from a fluoride mixture
known to have ZrO, as the stable oxide phase.’

The fluoride mixture consisted of LiF-BeF
(66-34 mole %) with added ZrF, equivalent to
0.5 mele of zirconium per kilogram of salt mix-
ture. About 1 mc of ?*°Pa was included in the
salt preparation as irradiated ThO,. The mix~
ture was pretreated with anhydrous HF and H,
to convert oxides to fluorides. |

The deliberate introduction of solid-phase oxide
to the melt was made by adding ZrO, in small
increments. Filtered samples of the salt mix-
ture were taken at assumed equilibrium condi-
tions after each oxide addition and were analyzed

production of fissionable 233U by substantially
reducing blanket inventory and equipment costs
and by improving neutron utilization. Accord-
ingly, chemical development efforts supporting

the removal of protactinium from the blanket mix-
ture, LiF-BeF -ThF , (73-2-25 mole %), by methods
which can be feasibly adapted as chemical proc-

muth with added thorium metal, was prepared in

started by transferring a known quantity of the
prepared salt mixture into the extraction vessel
containing the metal-phase extractant. Filtered
samples of the salt phase were taken periodically
for radiochemical analysis of dissolved protac-
tinium. In each experiment, ?33Pa was rapidly
removed from the salt phase and remained absent
from the solution during the approximately 100

hydrofluorination of the extraction system with
an HF-H, mixture (1:20 volume ratio) showed
that 233pa coald be rapidly and almost quanti-

is to examine methods for recovering 2°°Pa from

SOLUBILITY OF THORIUM IN MOLTEN LEAD

Current studies of the removal of protactinium
from a molten fluoride mixture, which simulates
the blanket of the reference design MSBR, have
been directed toward the development of a liquid-
liquid extraction process. The method proposes
that protactinium, as PaF, in a salt phase, can
be reduced to its metallic state and extracted
into a molten-metal phase. The possible use
of a molten mixture of thorium in lead would
provide a convenient method for combining: the
reducing agent with the metal-phase extractant
and for replenishing thorium to the fluoride blanket
mixture. The objective of this study has been
to establish the solubility of thorium in lead
over the temperature range of interest fo this
program and to provide a lead-thorium solution
of known composition for subsequent protactin-
ium-extraction experiments.

The experimental mixture, contained in low-
carbon steel, consisted of approximately 3 kg
of lead and 100 g of thorium-metal chips. Values
for the solubility of thorium were obtained by
analyses of filtered samples withdrawn from the
melt at selected temperatures over the interval
400 to 600°C under assumed equilibrium condi-
tions. Samples were withdrawn during two heat-
ing and cooling cycles and submitted for acti-
vation and spectrographic analyses. These re-
sults, plotted as the logarithm of the solubility
vs the reciprocal of the absolute temperature
in Fig. 3.8, indicate that the heat of solution
of thorium in lead is approximately 19 kcal/mole
and that its solubility at 600°C is about 1.85 x

PROTACTINIUM STUDIES IN THE HIGH-ALPHA
MOLTEN-SALT LABORATORY

C. J. Barton

The Reactor Chemistry Division has, for the
past few years, lacked facilities for research
with significant quantities of alpha-active mate-
rials 23%py and 23'Pa. Interest in
using the latter isotope as a stand-in for the
more radioactive 233Pa led to construction of
the High-Alpha Molten-Salt Laboratory which is
shown in Fig. 3.9. Seven interconnected glove

such as

boxes are presently installed in the laboratory,
and one end of the train is connected to a glove-
equipped hood. The glove boxes are maintained
at a negative pressure with respect to the labora-
tory by an and the
room is at a negative pressure with respect to
the surrounding area. The glove-box exit air
is doubly filtered, and all air exhausted from
the room discharges through the plant central
off-gas system.

The glove boxes are equipped for, or are adapt-
able to, a variety of operations, but the study

An experiment was performed in this box to

from molten salts reported earlier.!* Protactin-
ium at tracer concentration (<1 ppb %33Pa) was
completely precipitated by addition of thorium
oxide to molten LiF-BeF -ThF, (73-2-25 mole %),
and treatment of the oxide-contaminated melt
with a dry mixture of HI and H, redissolved the
protactinium, in agreement with the results of the
previous investigators.

Strode and Keller!” was used to purify about
0.1 g of **1pa 0.. The oxide was dissolved
in 2.5 M HF and loaded on an anion exchange

Purification by freezing is possible under some
circumstances. In the absence of solid-solution
formation and with freezing rates sufficiently
slow that rejected solute can diffuse away from
the advancing freezing front, high degrees of
purification can be achieved; in principle, this
process might be applicable to
fuel melts from a molten-salt reactor. Slowness

to give good separation of salts at freezing rates
sufficiently high to be of potential practical
interest.

For convenience and visibility, the LiCl-KC

eutectic, contained in an open 400-ml Pyrex

beaker, was used as the melt to which impurities
were added. Stirring was accomplished with a
Pyrex propeller stirring rod revolving at 700
rpm. The beaker was lowered from a hot zone
to a cold zone at a rate of about 2 cm/hr; this
was near the lower limit of rates that were deemed
of practical interest and was not changed. After
some preliminary trials, the segregations shown
in Table 3.4 were obtained while using a coiled

PREPARATION AND LOADING
OF MSRE FLUORIDES

J. H. Shaffer
W. K. R. Finnell

F. A. Doss
W. P. Teichert

The preparation of all MSRE fluoride mixtures
and the loading of these mixtures into the reactor
drain tanks have been completed by Renctor Chem-
istry Division personnel. Preparation of the
secondary-coolant and the flush salt (totaling
15,000 1b of "LiF. BeF mixture containing 66
mole % LiF) was completed and the mixture was
loaded into the MSRE during 1964.':% MSRE
fuel was prepared ag the following salt composi-
tions: fuel solvent ("Lil"-BeF -ZiF , 64.7-30.1-5.2
mole %), depleted fuel concentrate (LiF-*3%07 |
73-27 mele %), and enriched fuel
(TLiF-35UF ,, 73-27 mole %).

The enriched fuel concentrate (six batches, sach
containing about 33 1b of 2351) and most of the
11,000 1b of fuel solvent were prepared during
1964.17 The few remaining batches (each of
about 275 1b) of this material and the two batches
{of about 00 1b) of depleted fuel concentrate were
prepared during early 1965 by the technique de-
scribed previcusly.?

Loading of the fuel mixtures into the MSRE to
achieve final fuel composition for criticality and

concentrate

for eventual power operation was completed during
this reporting period. Initial loading consisted in
the transfer of 10,050 Ib of fuel solvent to the fuel
drain tank and the addition of 520 1b of depleted
fuel concentrate. This mixture, quite near to
the ultimate fuel composition but essentially with-

out enriched uranium, was then transferred to the
reactor circuit, was circulated there for some 250
hr in a precritical test (PC-2), and was returned to
the MSRE drain tank. There, enriched fuel con-
centrate was added. Four: additions of the con-
centrate (with criticality tests of the fuel in the
reactor core interspersed) brought the ?°5U inven-
tory of the drain-tank contents to 68.76 kg. These
operations had been accomplished in a routine
manner by previously described techniques®s? by
late May 1965.

Additions of enriched fuel concentrate to the
MSRE tank had, as anticipated, brought the 235)
concentration to more than 35% of that required for
criticality. The remaining ?3%U was added to the
fuel circulating in MSRE as solid pellets of enriched
fuel concentrate in small nickel capsules.® These

The capsule cluster and salt transfer line were
cooled to near room temperature while back flowing
helium through the system. The filled capsule
cluster was disconnected from the assembly and
its exposed tubes were capped. The net weight of
salt mixture in the cluster was determined, and
the cluster was sealed in a water-tight can. A

operation is shown in Fig. 4.1. The 161 capsules
were filled, at a rate of about five clusters per
day, during a five-day period, wotking two shifts
per day.

Although the accountability of 235U was main-
tained for each capsule cluster, each capsule was

For use in the MSRE, the capsules were detached
from the cluster, the inlet and outlet tubes were
sealed, and the capsules were opened and inserted
through an appropriate mechanism into the circu-
lating fuel in the MSRE pump bowl as needed.3

CHEMICAL BEHAYIOR OF FLUORIDES
DURING MSRE OPERATION

R. E. Thoma

The necessary service operations and the eval-
uations to determine whether the molten fluorides
retain their chemical purity during MSRE operation
form an important, integral part of the MSRE sup-
port program. In preparation for this effort, inves-
tigations have been made — and in some cases are
continuing ~ in such diverse lines as crystalliza-
tion behavior of reactor salts,*'® solubility of
possible contaminant oxides as a function of
temperature, ® compatibility of fluorides with their
metallic environments,” and the effects of irradia-
tion on molten and frozen salts.® In a closely
cooperative effort, the ORNL Analytical Chemistry
Division has developed methods for routine-basis
analyses for the several species whose concentra-
tions must be known if chemical integrity of the
system is to be assured.

Initial, precritical operation of the MSRE (run
PC-1) was performed with flush salt ("LiF -BeF ,
66 mole % "LiF) in the fuel circuit. This flush
salt, therefore, constituted the frozen-salt seal in
the freeze flanges and the freeze valves of the core
circuit. After circulation for a 1000-hr test (and
for removal of oxide scale, if any, from the reactor
circuit), the flush salt was drained to its own
storage tank. There it was treated with HF and H,
to remove oxide before reuse; a reassuringly small
quantity, cotresponding to 115 ppm of 0%”, was
recovered as H,0 in this step.

The fuel mixture was then constituted ~ with
an interruption for the PC-2 test — in the fuel
drain tank and the reactor circuit as described
in the section immediately preceding. Since the
reactor circuitry does not drain perfectly, the not
unexpected result was the dilution of the fuel
mixture by some flush salt left in the reactor from
PC-1. This dilution resulted in a disparity between
nominal and analytical values for uranium con-
centrations in PC-2 and in differences between
nominal and measured 23%U enrichment values
during the zero-power experiments. We believe
that approximately 140 Ib (less than 1.5%) of the
"LiF-BeF , flush-salt diluent remained in the fuel
circuitry at the end of the PC-1 test and was

responsible for the apparent discrepancy. Careful
chemical analysis and mass-spectrometric deter-
mination of the 2350/2387 ratio indicate that
the critical concentration in the MSRE was 4.453%
by weight of U (1.39% ?35U). This figure is lower
by 1.26% than the book value of 4.51% U.

Analysis samples for metallic corrosion
products continues to indicate that, as expected,
corrosion of the INOR-8 by the fluoride melts is
insignificant. The compounds NiF, and Fel
are unstable toward reduction by Cr in INOR-8;
these fluorides would be corrosion agents, therefore,
if present in the fluids. Neither FeF nor NiF
is stable toward reduction by H, at elevated
temperatures; the pretreatment of fuel, flush, and
coolant salts with HF-H and then H, should,
therefore, have removed other fluorides completely.
Chemical analysis of the fluoride mixtures before
introduction into the reactor showed about 5'ppm
of Ni and about 125 ppm of Fe. We believe that
these materials are present largely, if not entirely,
as colloidally suspended metals. On the other
hand, GF, is not reduced by H,; the analyzed
concentration of Cr (about 30 ppm initially) is
believed to be present as Cr2”.

During the PC-1 test, with "LiF-BeF, (66 mole
% 7LiF) in the fuel and coolant circuits, chromium
concentrations in the melt increased by about
25 ppm in the fuel circuit and by about 10 ppm
in the coolant circuit; thus, about 100 g of Cr
was removed from the interior walls of the reactor
circuit. Nickel concentrations remained at about
5 ppm during this test, while Fe concentrations
dropped by about 50 ppm. Occurrence of 50 ppm
of Fe?" in the initial melt is {aside from the
material-balance difficulty) scarcely credible. The
decrease in Fe concentration, therefore, was
believed to be due to settling of some 200 g of
Fe powder in the drain tank or in the circuit. The
increase in chromium concernttation represents, we
believe, a real increase in Cr?%; it is probably
due to dissolving of oxide films from the reactor
circuit walls and the subsequent reduction by Cr
of the Cr3*, Fed* and Ni?" so obtained.

Analyses for Fe, Cr, and Ni in the reactor fuel
of PC-2 and of subsequent critical and zero-power
runs (totaling about 1100 hr) show no appreciable
concentration changes. The failure of Cr?* to
increase in concentration is not surprising since
the oxides should have been well removed in PC-1
and since the fuel mixture was thoroughly treated

of
with H, (to the extent that about 2% of the uranium
was present as U3) before addition to the re-
actor.

Purity of the fuel during PC-2 and the zero-power
tests was assured by chemical analysis of daily
samples. Values for the concentration levels of
all contaminants except oxide were uniform, credible,
and satisfactorily low. Oxide values, obtained by
the KBrF method, were sporadic and high, pre-
sumably as a result of water adsorbed in samples
during sample preparation. Verification that oxide
concentration did not seriously exceed the solubility
limits was made by regular examination of salt
specimens employing petrographic methods, which
under favorable circumstances can detect the
presence of a few hundred ppm of crystalline
oxide.

In recent months, an improved method for deter-
mining the oxide concentration of MSRE salts has
developed. 1° The

reaction

been method employs the

0%~ + 2HF(¢) = H,0(g) + 2F~ .

Oxide concentration is regarded as equivalent to
the quantity of water evolved as a molten-salt
specimen is purged with an H -HF gas mixture.
The method has been applied for assay of the
flush- and fuel-salt specimens obtained during
initial operations of the MSRE full-power tests.
Oxide concentration was found to be approximately
100 ppm in both the flush and fuel salts.!!

From a chemical standpoint, the operation of the
MSRE during the precritical and zero-power experi-
ments was a success. There is every reason to
believe that the salts were maintained in an ex-
cellent state of purity during all transfer, fill,
and circulating operations.

MEASUREMENT OF DENSITIES
OF MOLTEN SALTS

B. J. Sturm R. E. Thoma

Relatively few measurements of the densities
of liquid salt mixtures have been made in the
development of ORNL molten-salt technology.
Values have usually been obtained from estimates
such as the relatively imprecise method of mixtures
employed by Cohen and Jones, !? based on room-
temperature densities of the components, or the
more satisfactory method employed by Cantor’?
which assumes additivity of molar volumes. In
an effort to obtain more accurate experimental
values, we have measured directly the volumes of
molten-salt mixtures at various temperatures. Initial
results of these experiments were reported pre-
viously. '* By adopting several experimental in-
novations, we have improved the accuracy of
experimental data appreciably. One such measure
is to prevent salt mixtures from freezing until all
volume measurements have been completed. In
this way, errors in the volume measurement arising
from distortion of the container vessel upon freez-
ing and remelting the salts are avoided. Values
obtained by this experimental! procedure are com-
pared with previous values in Table 4.1. The
equation for density, d, as a function of temperature
is

d =a~ bt.

The new values are considered to be in agreement
with the recent measurements of the salts stored
in drain tanks at the MSRE site.?

MECHANISM OF ANODIC FILM GROWTH ON
ZIRCONIUM AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES

A. L. Bacarella A. L. Sutton

It was shown previously’? that the anodic-film-

H SO, at temperatures from 200 to 284°C can be
represented by a hyperbolic sine function of the
field strength,

Previous work,® which showed that reactor ir-

irradiation corrosion, was extended to crystal-bar
zirconium. Specimens were: (1) pickled in HF-
HNO,, (2) vacuum (1 to 3 x 10~°% mm Hg) annealed
at 700°C to remove traces of fluoride, and (3)
exposed to 300°C steam-oxygen for 1 hr and heated
in helium at 500°C for 16 hr to provide an oxygen-
rich layer near the surface. The subsequent
treatments were the same as in previous experi-
ments.® Data from two specimens, one irradiated
and one control, show that the irradiated specimen
corrodes about twice as fast as the control. [It
is indicated that this radiation effect? is not
related to the additives in Zircaloy-2 nor to fluo-
ride left by pickling.

Poison control solutions of CdSO, are being

the effects of irradiation on the stability of these
solutions toward loss of cadmium is needed for a
complete evaluation of this poison control system.

We have planned and are developing experiments
to test the stability of CdSO, solutions under
electron with intensity and other
conditions such that they either simulate those in
the reactor or provide a severe test of the stability
under irradiation.

Test solutions in contact with Zircaloy-2 at
temperatures in the range 60 to 120°C will be ir-
radiated at power densities up to 150 w/cm®. The
solution will be static in one type of experiment.

irradiation,

In another type, the solution will be circulated in
order to simulate fluid-film conditions in the re~
actor. The temperatures, power densities, solu-
tion compositions, and container material will be
those of possible interest in the reactor. The use
of electrons rather than reactor radiations is ex
pected, from theoretical considerations,
crease the chance that an irradiation effect will
occur at a given power density. The two different
types of experiments are believed necessary to
assure that the radiation stability is tested under
conditions at least as severe as those in the re-
actor. Theoretical considerations did not enable
us to predict reliably whether agitation would
have any effect on the solution stability or, in
fact, the dicection of an effect if one occurred.

The static imadiation cell is comprised of a
single loop of small-bore Zircaloy-2 tubing sur-

to ine

rounded by a coolant jacket, as shown in Fig,
5.2. The Zircaloy-2 tubing contains a fine filter
at one end of the loop. In operation, the test solu
tion will be exposed to radiation in the Zircaloy-2
tube, It will then be forced through the filter,
collected, and analyzed. The temperature will
be controlled by passing controlled-temperature
water through the jacket at a rapid rate. The re-
sults of component testing of the static system
have provided reasonable assurance of design
feasibility and adequacy. The final test system
is under construction.

Dynamic experiments will be conducted with a
small, high-speed (35,000 rpm), centrifugal pump
with which solution is circulated through a small
tube which forms a loop in front of the cover plate
of the pump. The diameter of the pump is about
% in., and the total liquid volume is about % em’.
All the solution will be irradiated continuously
during an exposure. The tube is included in order
to provide a channel in which the flow is well
defined and in which film coefficients can be cal-
culated and, if necessary, measured. Calculations

Beryllium Corrosion

Three highsflux reactors either being constructed
or designed will use metallic berylliuin, exposed
directly to the coolant, as moderator. The reactors
are the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR), the
Advanced Test Reactor (ATR), and the Argonne
Advanced Research Reactor (AARR). In the
first two reactors, the coolant will be water ad-
justed to a pH of 5.0 with nitric acid at a maximum
temperature of about 100°C; in the AARR, the
coolant will be deionized water at a slightly lower
temperature.

Test results reported previously !® showed that,
in water adjusted to a pH of 5.0 and flowing at 12
to 80 fps, beryllium corroded at a constant rate of
1.9 mils/year over periods that lasted as long as
17,600 hr.

A few small pits were noted on some
In these tests, the ratio of
exposed beryllium surface area to volume of water
was 10 cm?/liter and the system contained 22.5
liters of water, which was continuously deionized
by passing a side stream through a cation ex-
changer (hydrogen form) at the rate of 3 liters/hr.

In one of the specimens in the above series of
tests, two cracks originated from stenciled identi-
fication marks on one edge of a specimen. These
were first detected after 10,440 hr of exposure.
Prior to that time, all specimens had been ex-
amined several times and no cracks had been found.
This particular specimen was removed from test after
11,980 hr and subjected to metallographic exami-

nation. Figure 5.3 shows the larger of the two

cracks, which penetrated into the metal a distance
of 7 mils. Examination of the polished specimen
under polarized light showed the crack to be trans-
granular in nature, This appears to be the first
incident of stress~-corrosion cracking of beryllium
ever reported,

In recent tests conducted for the AARR in de-
ionized water at 93°C (200°F) at 44 fps, the effect
of the ratio of surface area of exposed beryllium
to volume of water was examined. In tests that
lasted in excess of 1000 hr, it was shown that
when the exposed beryllium area was 0.45 cm?
per liter of water, the beryllium corroded at a
constant rate of 2.7 mils/year. Under identical
conditions with a surface-area-to-volume ratio of
4.5 cm?/liter, the corrosion rate was 1.1 mils/
year. In both of the above tests, the total volume
of water in the system was 27.6 liters and a side
stream was passed through a mixed-bed deionizer
at a rate of 4.9 liters/hr, This is the same relative
rate of deionization that will be used in the AARR.
The ratio of exposed surface area of beryllium to
volume of water in the AARR is 2.3 cm?/liter,
essentially midway between the extremes tested.

Although one isolated case of apparent stress-
corrosion cracking was observed and a few small
isolated pits were found, the test results indicate
that unclad beryllium will have adequate corrosion
resistance in the three new reactors,

Chemical Development for HFIR Operation

G. H. Jenks has concluded from a study of the
expected radiation chemistry of the HFIR coolant
(water adjusted to a pH of 5.0 with nitric acid)
that either oxygen or hydrogen peroxide at some
moderate level must be present in the coolant to
assure the stability of the nitrate ions.!” It is,
therefore, desirable to monitor continuously the
excess oxidizing capacity of the solution, that
is, the concentration of oxygen and hydrogen
peroxide in excess of the equivalent concentration
of hydrogen, During precritical hydraulic testing
of the HFIR system, the usefulness of a con-
tinuous oxygen analyzer'® based on the reaction
of dissolved oxygen with thallium

metal relatively slowly aad irreproducibly, so it
was necessary to include a catalytic chamber con-
taining a large surface area of platinum to de-
compose the peroxide and permit measurement
of total available oxygen. Laboratory studies
showed that the platinum effectively recombines
dissolved hydrogen and oxygen, so that in the
HFIR system only the excess oxidant will be
measured. This measurement will be used ‘to
conirol the addition rate of oxidant (either oxygen
or hydrogen peroxide) to the HFIR primary coolant.

With the above analyzer and confirmatory chemi-
cal analyses, the decomposition rate of hydrogen
peroxide in the primary coolant was determined in
the absence of radiation. The results indicated
that the decomposition is a homogeneous solution
reaction with a half-life of about 6 hr at 105 to
110°F.

Hydriding of Zircaloy-2 and Tantalum
In the Transuranium Processing Facility, the

aluminum-clad target rods irradiated in the HFIR
will be dissolved in hydrochloric acid. Both

Zircaloy=2 and tantalum have adequate corrosion
resistance to the acid solution for equipment use,
but both can suffer hydrogen embrittlement under
some conditions. Therefore, a series of tests with
both materials was conducted to determine’ the
amount of hydrogen entering the metal from the
corrosion process and its effect on the ductility
of the material,

Zircaloy~2 strips, 10 mils thick, and tantalum
specimens of similar thickness were exposed to
8 M HCL at several temperatures for periods of
1000, 2000, and 3000 hr. After exposure, each
specimen was given a 180” bend test as a qualita~
tive measure of its ductility. Originally, the
Zircaloy-2 contained 8 ppm hydrogen and the
tantalum 1 ppm. The hydrogen content and cor-
rosion rate of the Zircaloy-2 specimens after
various exposure periods and the results of the
bend tests are shown in Table 5.2.

At each temperature, the hydrogen content ap-
peared to be approaching a limiting value after
2000 to 3000 hr. Generally, the corrosion rate
and the corresponding hydrogen content increased
with temperature. For the particular geometry
involved, the hydrogen concentration required to

During the past year, the effort in this program
has been concerned solely with the behavior of
pure nickel and Hastelloy N in various gas-phase

the fuel elements are suspended in a fluidized bed

of aluminum oxide, and, depending on the specific

process, are subjected cyclically to fluorine, 60-

oxygen alone at temperatures as high as 800°C,
In the tests conducted, specimens of both materials
were exposed in the fluidized bed and in the gas
phase above it.

Both Hastelloy N and nickel underwent only
minor corrosion during 31 cycles of exposure to a
60-40 mixture of O HF at 625°C. Each cycle
consisted of a period of 1 hr for heatup, 6 hr at
temperature, and 1 hr for cooling. Both alloys

plotted as a function of temperature at pressures to
4000 bars. The type of behavior shown in Fig. 6.1
is typical for a strong electrolyte, and is similar to
the results obtained previously with potassium sul-
fate.?®'5 As the temperature increases from 0 to
300°C, iotiic mobilities increase rapidly due to
the rapid decrease in the viscosity of water.
Therefore the conductance of the sodium chloride
solutions increases also. However, the dielectric
constant of water is also decreasing with increas-
ing temperature. This lowering of dielectric con-
stant allows ion pair formation fo begin to occur.
Apparently, at approximately 300 to 450°C (de-
pending on the pressure) the two effects (increas-
ing mobility of the ions; increasing association
between the ions) begin to offset one another, and
the conductance begins to diminish with increasing
temperature. It should also be noted that when
the temperature of an aqueous solution is in-
creased, at constant pressure, the density de-
creases so that there are fewer ions per cubic
centimeter, and consequently a smaller conduct-
ance.

In another study, measurements have been made
on 0.01 demal (20.01 m) potassium chloride solu-
tions (this is used as a standard solution for
conductance cell constant determinations at 25°C)
to 800°C and 4000 bars. It is thought that this
would be the logical solution to use for a reference
at elevated temperatures and pressures; thus, as
more researchers make conductance measurements
af high temperatures and pressures, the results
from the different laboratories can be more easily
compared. Figure 6.2 shows a comparison of
previously detemmined conductances of K,80,,

AQUEOUS SOLUBILITY OF MAGNETITE
AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES

F. H. Sweeton R. W. Ray
C. F. Baes, Jr.

The solubility of magnetite (Fe, 0,) in aqueous
solutions at elevated temperatures is of special
interest in pressurized-water reactor systems, in
which Fe,0, is a main component of the corrosion
film. It also is of interest to geologists in under-
standing the origin of Fe 0, deposits. ®

The flowing system for measuring the solubility
that was reported earlier® bas been modified in
several ways to improve the precision of the data.
One important change has been the substitution
of 66 g of nonradioactive Fe,O, for 2.7 g of
radioactive material, thus making possible a longer
contact time with the solution. This Fe, 0, was
prepared by oxidizing a carbonyl iron powder with
steam at 400 to 500°C. Its final specific surface
area was 0.12 m?2/g, about twice that of the radio-
active material.

Water for the tests was purified and equilibrated
with H, as before. All batches had conductivities
of less than 0.08 micromho/cm at room tempera-
tures, and concentrations of dissolved 0, below
10 ppb (and usually less than 5 ppb).

The purified water, sometimes containing added
HCl, was pumped first through a recombiner in
which it made contact with platinum black at
260°C (to catalyze the reaction of the remaining
0, with H,), and on through the bed of Fe 0, in
a column held at a controlled temperature. The
solution was then cooled and passed through a
Millipore filter with 0.1-u pores. The recombiner,
column, and filter holder were made of gold-plated
stainless steel. Platinum tubing was used to

connect the units. The equilibrated solution was

We have used the upper two groups of data in

molal and atmospheric units) for the reaction

Y% Fe 0,(s) + 2H (soln) + %11,(g)

The resulting values of log K at 150 and 200°C
are 7.00 and 6.08 with standard deviations of
0.11 and 0.06 respectively. We think the other
150°C points are low due to a slight leakage of
0, into the pH cell to give the reaction

and we are now modifying the pH cell to prevent
this. The solubility product estimated for 200°C
predicts that the solubility of Fe 0, in pure H,0
should be 1.4 pm; this is in good agreement with
our previously reported? figure of 1.5 um.

We will continue measurements to cover the
range of 150 to 260°C with HCI solutions from
0 to 30 pum with the intention of examining the
data to see if the dissolved iron is hydrolyzed.

The solubilities of calcium hydroxide and the
saturation behavior of calcium hydroxide—calcium
carbonate mixtures were determined at tempera-
tures from 0.5 to 350°C in aqueous solutions of
sodium nitrate from 0 to above 5 m in concen-
tration.

Commercially available reagent grade calcium
hydroxide wand calcium carbonate were digested
in boiling deionized water to remove soluble im-
purities. The hot solutions were filtered and the
recovered product dried at 100 to 110°C. The dry
calcium hydroxide was ignited at 1150°C for about
16 hr to convert calcium carbonate impurities to
calcium oxide; the carbon dioxide content of the

freshly ignited oxide was about 250 ppm. Excess
solid calcium hydroxide and mixtures of calcium
hydroxide and calcium carbonate were equilibrated
with aqueous sodium nitrate, prepared with de-

withdrawal at the temperature of the experiment
in order to remove suspended solids. A portion
of each sample was treated with excess concen-
trated nitric acid, evaporated to dryness at 95 to
100°C, and weighed as calcium and sodium ni-
trates. Another portion of each sample solution
was used for the determination of calcium ion
concentration by a potentiometric titration with
standard EDTA solution.
tration in the solution was determined by difference
from the results of these two analyses.

SURFACE CHEMISTRY OF THORIA

Heats of Immersion and Adsorption

The calorimetric investigation of the interaction
of water with the surface of ThO, is continuing.
The apparatus and procedure have been de-
scribed. ?™%

Net differential heats of adsorption (AH) of
water on ThO, have been derived from calori-
metrically determined heats of immersion (h;) of
ThO, samples containing known amounts of pre-
sorbed water (adsorbed after outgassing at 500°C
but prior to the immersion experiments). These
studies have been completed for three samples
of ThO : A (650°C, 14.7 m?/g); B (800°C, 11.5
m?/g); and E (1600°C, 1.24 m?/g). Data in pa-
rentheses refer to the calcining temperature and
specific surface area respectively. Initial values
of AH_ ranged from -20 to —30 kcal/mole.
no case did AH decrease to zero with completion
of the first adsorbed monolayer. These large
exothermic values clearly indicate that the water
is in a chemisorbed state, most probably as sur-

face hydroxyl groups resulting from hydrolysis
of surface oxide ions. At larger coverages addi-
tional contributions to AH, arise from hydrogen
bonding between the surface hydroxyl groups and
the subsequently adsorbed layers of water. Sam-
ples A and B gave AH_ vs coverage curves which
are typical of adsorption on a heterogeneous sur-
face.® The corresponding curve for sample E
exhibited three distinct regions in which water
is adsorbed with a constant AH_. The most
plausible explanation for this unusual behavior
is the formation of successive immobile homo-
geneous monolayers. Such an idealized adsorp-
tion is more likely to occur with sample E because
of its relatively large crystallite size (>2500 A)
as compared to samples A and B (200 A).

The dependence of the heat of immersion on
physical properties such as specific surface area,
particle size, and crystallite size is a complex
unresolved question. *:5:7 The heats of
immersion of a series of low-surface-area ThO,
samples are shown in Fig. 7.1. In addition to
sample KE, these include samples D (1200°C,

1.55 m?/g); and 1. (1600°C, 0.95 m?/g). Maxi-
mum deviation of the experimental points from
the curves in Fig. 7.1 is about 2%. From a con-
sideration of the combined uncertainty in the
surface area and heat measurements, one must
conclude that samples E, J, K, and L have iden-

reactions, one must work with samples having
low specific surfaces and a relatively large crys-
tallite size (the crystallite size of these samples
ranged from 1500 to >2500 A). This does not,
account for the results obtained with
sample D. The only physical difference in sam-
ple D is the particle size. Samples E, J, K,
and L have a mean particle diameter of about

however,

1.5 yu, while the corresponding value for sample
D is 3.0 yg. On this basis it appears that the
number of crystallites per particle is an important

factor. Conceivably, this could influence the
number and type of crystal faces exposed for
surface reactions. Further experiments are re-

quired to resolve this important point.

Water Vapor Adsorption and Desorption

E. L. Fuller, Jr. H. F. Holmes

The complex nature of water adsorption on tho-
rium oxide has been studied by use of a sensitive
microbalance. High-temperature sintering (12009C)
appears to produce a material which predominantly
presents the 100 cubic face in the surface, upon
which there are three distinct modes of adsorption.
There is an initial rapid chemisorption, forming
surface hydroxyl groups which are slowly hydrated.
In addition and as a precursor for surface hydra-
tion, physical adsorption occurs.

69

Isotherms constructed at 25.00°C reveal the
type II physical adsorption isotherms character-
istic of polar adsorbates. In addition, the slow
hydrating process occurs as a perturbing effect:
each successive isotherm fails to close upon
the preceding one by a decreasing amount until,
after six months of repetitive adsorption and de-
sorption, a reproducible isotherm is achieved.

The rate of irreversible binding is a complex
function of both the water vapor pressure and the
amount of water previously bound. The rate is
increased markedly with the first increments of
pressure, but higher increments have
less accelerating effects. The rate diminishes
appreciably as more water is bound under the

physically adsorbed water.

pressure

The final vacuum
weight of adsorbed water corresponds exactly to
the aforementioned stoichiometry.

The 1000°C calcination decreases the number
of pores but does uot alter the distribution (there
are still pores of radii near 10 A); whereas the
small pores anneal out at the 1200°C calcination,
leaving a minimum radius of 50 A. The fact
that thorium oxide must be heated to 1000°C
in vacuo to remove all water indicates that there
two different types

are of sintering involved.

The amount of bound water is stoichiomefrically
equivalent to that required to form the surface
analog of a hydrated bulk hydroxide. In addition,
this is the amount of water required to build up
one completed face-centered cubic lattice unit
on the surface above the 100 ThO, plane, with
the hydroxide and water oxygen occupying the
image positions of the substrate oxide ions. Thus
this bound water may be similar to the cubic form
of ice, where the O—Q spacing is nearly equal to
that present in bulk ThO ,.

The shape of the nitrogen isotherms at —195°C
changes, showing that the partial pressure at
which monolayer (BET) coverage occurs increases
from below 0.05 to 0.13 as more water is pre-
adsorbed. This is undoubtedly due to the fact
that the water-covered surface is less enetgetic
and has less affinity for the nitrogen.

The extremely low vapor pressure of the initially
adsorbed water and the complex kinetics of hydra-
tion must be considered before evaluating thermo-
dynamic properties or specific surface areas’ from
water isotherms. One must be equally cautious
when attempting to predict the amount of adsorp-
tion from these isotherms.

Infrared Spectra of Adsorbed Species on Thoria

C. S. Shoup, Jr.

Exploratory infrared spectra of a thin, self-sup-
porting pressed disk® of thorium oxide (sample
A)? were recorded in vacuo (107° torr) as a func-
tion of pretreatment conditions. The disk was
held in a nickel sample holder within an infrared
cell and, by means of an external magnet, could
be raised to a section of the cell away from the
silver chloride windows and heated as high as
500°C. After pretreatment at a known temper-
ature for at least 24 hr, the cell was sealed off
under a vacuum, the sample cooled and lowered
to the optical section, and the cell placed in the
spectrophotometer.® All spectra were obtained
at about 35°C, and the sample was not exposed
to the atmosphere between measurements.

Several features of interest are shown in the
infrared spectra of Fig. 7.2. The most obvious

feature is the general decrease in intensity of
the various absorption bands with increasing out-
gassing temperature, particularly between 200
and 500°C. In addition, several of the absorption
bands are displaced in frequency, and in some
cases new bands appear with
gassing temperature. This
formation of structurally different adsorbed species

A series of in vacuo infrared spectra were ch-
tained after the 5007C-out-gassed thoria had been
exposed to water vapor for periods of 24 hr to
as long as 11 days each before subsequent evacu-
ation at room temperature. Each successive
spectrum revealed the presence of a greater quan-
tity of adsorbed water than the previous spectrum,
thus confirming the slow ‘irreversible’ adsorp-
tion of water that had been originally detecied
gravimetrically. 1?

Fig. 7.3. Specific Surface Conductivity as a Function
of Electrolyte Specific Conductivity.

An investigation of ThO, plugs from a variety
of sources, however, indicates that the electro-
kinetic potential is strongly influenced by the
method of preparation of the thoria. For example,
one batch of thoria calcined at 1600°C gave no
indication of a positive zeta potential over the
pH range of 5.9 to 12. The complex behavior of
the electrical double layer has been observed in
other oxide—aqueous solution systems!4—1¢ and
appears to be highly dependent on the chemical
and thermal history of the sample. Until this
dependence can be put on a concrete basis, zeta-
potential measurements for such systems must
be assumed to be valid only for the specific sam-
ples investigated.

Measurements of the electrical conductance of
agueous solutions flowing through porous plugs
of ThO, were correlated with measurements using
ceramic capillaries with known geometries. 17 This
made it possible to measure the cell constant
associated with the surface conductance’! and
thus to determine the specific surface conduc-
tivity for several electrolytes. The variation of
the specific surface conductivity, A, with the
specific conductivity of the bulk solution, A,
is illustrated in Fig. 7.3 for a variety of porous
plugs and capillaries of thorium oxide.

An important feature of the results shown in
Fig. 7.3 is the fact that they are some two to
three orders of magnitude larger than would be
predicted from the classical theories of surface
conductance. !® In addition, there seems to be
no obvious relationship between the surface con-
ductivity and the electrokinetic potential as pre-
dicted by these theories. Classically, the expo-
nential dependence of surface conductivity on
the electrokinetic potential is based on the pres-
ence of excess ions in the double layer due to
the potential difference. In the present system,
however, it appears that the contribution of the
excess ions in the double layer is masked by a
second mechanism which is much larger in magni-
tude.

It is believed that this second mechanism is the
ionization and subsequent conductance of surface
hydroxyl groups. This mechanism is further indi-
cated by the relatively slight dependence of the
surface conductivity on the bulk ionic concentra-
tion, implying that the concentration of the sur-
face conducting species is also only slightly
dependent on the bulk ionic concentration. If
the major mechanism for surface conductance is
ionization of surface hydroxyl groups, it should be
dependent on pH, as shown by the consistently
high values obtained with NH, OH. In the case of
basic solutions of Na ,CO,, however, the slight but
consistent reduction in surface conductivity may
be due to strong specific adsorption of carbonate

ions.

GAS EVOLUTION FROM SOL.-GEL
URANIUM-THORIUM OXIDE FUELS

D. N. Hess B. A. Soldano
Thoria—3% UO, sol-gel material prepared for
use as a reactor fuel has been found to evolve
gases when heated or when in reactor service.
Such gases could develop excessive pressure
within fuel elements or could react with the fuel
element cladding to weaken it or to affect its
heat transfer capability. Previous study of gas

face area, was an important parameter, with respect
to both the amount and composition of the gas
evolved, and that CO, was reversibly absorbed
at temperatures below 500°C and easily desorbed
at higher temperatures.

Studies during the past year have been directed
toward the development of treatments which would
reduce the surface area of the prepared sol-gel
and thus reduce the amount of gas which it could
release in service. Batch exposures at temper-
atures of 1000°C to CO, or H,0 alone did not
give any substantial change in the surface area
of the sol-gel or in its capacity for reversible
adsorption of Co,. On the other hand, mixtures
of the two gases, Co, and H,O, at 1000°C were
found to give approximately 50% decreases in
the surface area and absorption capacity of the
sol-gel for each treatment. The duration of the
treatment did not appear to be important. Thus,
two treatments would reduce the surface area to

less gas evolution upon being ground in the as-

the new material, if its preparation proves to be

TRANSPORT PROPERTIES OF GASES

Thermal Transpiration. Rotational Relaxation
Numbers for Nitrogen and Carbon Dioxide

A. P. Malinauskas

It is well known that serious errors in pressure
measurement can result if the manometer is
maintained at a temperature other than that of
the region whose pressure is of interest. The
phenomenon responsible for the discrepancy is
known as thermal transpiration (or the “‘thermo-
molecular pressure effect’) and is defined as the
transport of mass as the result of a temperature
gradient. Unlike thermal diffusion, however, which
is similarly defined, the thermal transpiration phe-
nomenon is not restricted to distinguishable par-
ticles. In fact, ever since its discovery in 1879
by Reynolds,! investigations of the effect have
been conducted exclusively with pure gases.

Unfortunately, the utility of the phenomenon was
thought to be solely that of a pressure correction;
as a result, the scientific community appears to
have been content with the empirical and semi-
empirical formulations which were proposed and
shown experimentally to be qualitatively correct
at best. Recently, however, Mason and co

to obtain regarding inelastic mo-

The first real test of the theories involved have
been completed in this laboratory during the past
year. Thermal transpiration studies were con-
ducted with the gases Ar, Xe, N,, and Co,.
The phenomenon was generated by maintaining
temperatures of about 290K and 545% on the
opposite ends of fourteen O.l-mm-ID Pyrex glass
capillaries arranged in parallel.

Although several apparently minor discrepancies

utility of the method for studies of inelastic col-
lisions has been demonstrated to be extremely
promising. For example, the rotational collision
numbers for N, and CO, which were obtained from
the experimental data were found to be 4.4 and
2.4, respectively, and are in excellent agreement
with reported values which were determined by
the more conventional, elaborate,
methods. *

Gaseous Diffusion in Noble Gas Systems

Unlike related transport properties, gaseous
diffusion, the transport of mass or identity as the
result of a concentration gradient, is almost
totally govemed by unlike-molecule interactions,
that is, like-molecule collisions affect the mecha~
nism only as small perturbations. However, the

the interactions necessitates measurements either
over a wide range of temperature or of an accuracy

two alternatives, the former appears to be the
more feasible. Indeed, some diffusion measure-
ments have been reported at temperatures as high
as 1100°K without a corresponding loss

so stringent and the procedure is so elaborate
that a more simple approach is desirable. Such
an approach appears to have been provided by
theory, in that it is possible to relate the com-
position dependence of viscosity to the diffusion
coefficient characteristic of a given gas pair.®
Thus, because viscosity coefficients at high
(or low) temperatures can be readily determined
experimentally, the evaluation of diffusion data
via the theoretical relationship is worthy of in-
vestigation. Although the objectives of the dif-
fusion program at the Laboratory are primarily
oriented toward an elucidation of intermolecular
interactions, the initial studies have been con-

cermed with an affirmation of the viscosity-
The first series of
investigations in this regard were made with the
systems He-Ar, He-Xe, and Ar-Xe and have
resolved a previous discrepancy between theory

Xe-Kr. Analysis of the latter data has not yet

Gaseous Diffusion in Porous Media

This model, which is particularly useful for a
description of gas transport in the theoretically
difficult transition
and hydrodynamic mechanisms are of equal im-
portance, utilizes the somewhat unorthodox view
that the solid surfaces of a porous medium or of
the walls of capillaries may be mathematically re-

garded as agglomerates of giant gas molecules
(dust). As a result, a gas-surface interaction is
treated as a special type of molecular encounter
as would occur between two gas molecules when
one of the interacting molecules is immobile and
preponderantly larger and heavier than the other.

Use of the model has yielded the first con-
sistent treatments of gas transport in porous
septa for the following cases:?'? (1) diffusion
due to a composition gradient; (2) gas flow as
the result of gradients in composition and pres-
sure; (3) thermal transpiration, in which pressure
and temperature gradients are involved; and (4)
migration (and separation) of gases under the
combined influence of composition and tempera-
ture gradients. However, our inability, at the
time, to cope with the combination of diffusive
and viscous modes of transport in a manner which
was satisfactory from a theoretical viewpoint
necessitated the introduction to a certain degree
of empirical methods in those cases in which
pressure gradients were at least partly respon-
sible for the particular transport phenomenon.

Somewhat erroneously, perhaps, we sought a
clarification of this so-called ‘‘forced-flow”’
problem in higher kinetic theory approximations.
The approach was fruitful in an indirect manner
in that it led to the discovery of the proper
procedure of combining diffusive and viscous
flows, and probably to a complete solution of the
gas transport problem.

Stated briefly, separate (mentally)
motion in a gas mixture into a diffusive flux and
a viscous flux. What we have learned, however,
is that the total flux is simply the sum of these
two fluxes; that is, there is no direct interaction
between viscous and diffusive flows; the only
‘“cross term’’ of consequence can be absorbed

justification

To date, the theoretical reinvestigation of dif-
fusion in the presence of a pressure gradient has
been the most fruitful aspect of this work; a
semiempirical equation which had been derived
earlier has now been developed completely from
theory, with an explict expression for what had
been an empirical (and adjustable) coefficient.
Moreover, the new results lead directly to the
prediction of the Kramers-Kistemaker'? or Kirken-
dali'! effect, in which a pressure drop is gen-
erated when the net flux in a diffusing mixture
is zero.

From the curves related to the distribution we can
extract values of the range R and a distribution
parameter associated with the recoil range,
called the straggling factor @. Although special
low-density pyrocarbon specimens have been
prepared for experiments to be conducted in the
near future, present experiments have been re-
stricted to General Electric pyrocarbon speci-
mens.

To initiate a series of experiments, pyrocarbon
specimens are bombarded with 2?3U* at 40 kev
to form fission-fragment sources. The source
specimens, accompanied by an uncontaminated
pyrocarbon target are exposed to
thermal-neutron fluxes. All specimens are then
and assayed by gamma
counting so that integral curves related to the
distribution of fragments can be con-
structed. Applicable transport equations predict
that plots of F.R., the total activity remaining
in a specimen after grinding to a penetration z,

most of the interval between zero and R. The

tail beyond z/R = 0.95. Extrapolations to the z
value corresponding to F.R. = 0 will indicate the

(sometimes catalyzed by high actinide concentra-
tions) do not occur at the conditions of these ex-
periments. Dramatic verification (see Fig. 8.2)
of this is evidenced by the fact that our uranium

coefficients, obtained at concentrations danger-
ously near the anticipated C value, show ex-~
cellent agreement? with uranium coefficients 2°
obtained at practically zero actinide concentra-
tions (carrier-free 2320).

In opposition to thin-layer results, preliminary
constant-potential data suggest comparatively high

coefficients and low activation energies. How-
ever, these results may agree with the high-
concentration results?! for HTM-PyC. Con-
siderations of combined structural and

concentration effects might enable reconciliation
of the anomalous diffusion behavior as observed
at high and low concentration levels. It is clear,
however, that thin-layer data are not indicative
of fuel migration in carbide fuel-particle coatings
since the actinide concentrations at coating~
carbide interfaces are guite high.

Self-Diffusion

R. B. Evans 111

Several dramatic changes occur in pyrolytic
carbons when subjected to temperatures above

22a: . PE.

Similar comparisons indicate a less-thansexcellent
agreement of thorium coefficients. The magnitudes of
ccefficients reported by Wolfe. et al., are greater than
ours by a factor of 5; however, D,/D ratios and AE
values are comparable, +
those at which they are deposited. At high tem-
peratures the structures ‘‘improve’ in that they
tend to assume a graphitic structure; values of
the thermal conductivity and impurity-atom dif-
fusivity decrease. The rate and mode of this an-
nealing process are diffusion controlled and are
best interpreted through self-diffusion measure-
ments.

In systems other than graphite, self-diffusion
measurements may be circumvented, since the
self-diffusion coefficient has been correlated with
other properties more amenable to experimenta-
tion. Analogous correlations for graphite are
undetermined; the necessity of conducting the
formidable self-diffusion experiments still re-
mains, if for no other reason than to obtain cor-
relations of the type mentioned.

We have initiated a systematic study of the
role of self-diffusion in the annealing phenomena

effect, if any, the addition of methane might have
on this reaction. Data obtained from these studies
are given in Table 9.1. Carbon removal calcu-
lated from CO, + CO found in the effluent gases
shows that the water vapor—graphite reaction was
retarded by the addition of methane, although to a
lesser exient than by an equal concentration of
hydrogen.® If only weight changes are detemined,
one might conclude that the oxidation of graphite
by water vapor was completely suppressed. Data
obtained from the effluent gases, however, show
that both oxidation and deposition occurred. The
calculated and observed weight changes agreed
satisfactorily in those cases where weight losses
or small weight gains were found. The calculated
weight changes were significantly larger than the
measured weight changes in those instances where
large weight gains prevailed. This behavior could
be due to spalling of carbon from the graphite sur
face. Both the oxidation and deposition rates de-
creased with decreasing temperature and were nof
measurable at temperatures much below 700°C.
Carbon deposition rates from methane-helium mix-
tures were determined in the absence of water
vapor to establish what effect water vapor might
have had on the cracking of methane. A compari-
son of the calculated deposition rates listed in
Table 9.1 with those given in Fig. 9.1 shows that
water vapor has very little, if any, effect on the
cracking of methane. The overall rates are dif-
ferent, however, in the two cases due to loss of
carbon by oxidation in the presence of water vapor.
The slopes of the plots given in Fig. 9.1 cor-
respond to activation energies of ~~ 50 kcal/mole
for all concentrations of methane examined. The

it was found that deposition rates increased with
increasing carbon monoxide concentrations. The
deposition rates at constant carbon monoxide con-

COMPATIBILITY OF PYROLYTIC-CARBON-
COATED FUEL PARTICLES WITH
WATER VAPOR

C. M. Blood

Current developments indicate that fuel particles
coated with pyrolytic carbon will be present in all-
ceramic cores of high-temperature gas-cooled re-
actors. Inleakage of water vapor during operation
of such a reactor poses hazards because of the
high temperatures of the core components, Oxida-
tion of the fuel particle coatings could cause coat-
ing failures and a resultant release of volatile fis-
sion products into the helium coolant.

The compatibility of various batches of fuel
particles with water vapor has been examined® in
an attempt to evaluate the hazards. In these
studies, fuel particles were exposed at 1000°C to
flowing helium-water vapor mixtures having partial
pressures of water vapor of 4.5, 45, and 570 torrs.
The fuel particles had various types of pyrolytic
carbon coatings and cores of UC, or (U,Th)C,.
The reactivity of the fuel coatings was determined
from weight changes and effluent gas composi-
tions. The incidence of failure of the coatings
was obtained from the quantities of uranium and
thorium removed by acid leach following exposure
to water vapor. Microscopic and metallographic
examinations were made following exposure to
water vapor and also after acid leach. Surface
area measurements were made on hoth oxidized
and unoxidized fuel particles.

Reaction rates for different batches of fuel par-
ticles obtained at 1000°C using various partial
pressures of water vapor are given in Fig. 9.2.
These data show that the apparent order of the
water vapor-—coating reaction increased with in-
creasing partial pressure of water vapor in virtu-
ally all cases. This could be due, in part, to dif-
ferences in burnoff at the various partial pressures.

The incidence of failure of the coatings also may
be responsible for this behavior. In general, only
a few particles failed at a partial pressure of 4.5
torrs, whereas at 570 torrs appreciable fractions
failed in all cases. If the core residues catalyzed
the reaction, this could account for the change in
apparent order observed. This behavior inakes an
extrapolation to other partial pressures hazardous.

particles from various batches showed that the
mode of attack varied from batch to batch; this
might be anticipated from the variable reaction
rate and surface area data.

Studies of the effect of support media for the fuel

Photomicrographs of oxidized

particles on the reaction rate showed that rates
obtained with alumina or platinum were essentially
the same. Use of a graphite sleeve to support the
fuel particles reduced the attack of water vapor
on the coatings; the degree of protection increased
with increasing sleeve length. This suggests that a

86

graphite body can afford protection for the particle
coatings but that the configuration of the fuel as-
sembly will determine, to a large degree, the extent
of protection obtained.

The studies are continuing, with emphasis being
placed on the effect of higher temperature (1200
to 1400°C) and of prior irradiation on the reactivity
with water vapor.

COMPATIBILITY OF METALS WITH LOW
CONCENTRATIONS OF CARBON MONOXIDE

J. E. Baker

In the BeO-graphite compatibility tests,® metals
are used as heat shields in an inert-gas atmosphere
containing ~~ 200 ppm of carbon monoxide at tem-
peratures ranging from 400 to 800°C. Possible
deposition of carbon on the metal surfaces and the
resulting decrease in reflectance prompted a lab-
oratory study of the metals in an atmosphere ap-
proximating that prevailing in the engineering tests.

Specimens of molybdenum, gold-plated stainless
steel, and mild steel were exposed to flowing
helium (1 atm) containing 250 to 300 ppm of carbon
monoxide at temperature intervals of ~100°C in
the temperature range of ~450 to 850°C. Expo-
sure times averaged ™~30 hr at each temperature.
Weight changes were continuously recorded by a
sensitive analytical balance, and the influent and
effluent pases were analyzed by a sensitive gas
chromatograph. X-ray studies were made of the
exposed specimens in an attempt to identify any
deposits formed.

The molybdenum specimen gained ~10 pg/cm?
during an exposure time of ~150 hr. The weight
changes were so small that the effect of tempera-
ture could not be measured. The exposed speci-
men had a very thin datk-gray film and a few spots
suggesting localized attack. The film is probably
an oxide, which could have been produced by very
low concentrations of oxygen and/or water vapor
present as contaminants in the helium stream.
There was no evidence of carbon deposition.

The gold-plated stainless steel specimen showed
an overall weight gain of ~~ 100 ug/cm? for an ex-

posure time of ~~ 150 hr. The rate of weight gain

varied by about a factor of 2 over the temperature
range examined, with no consistent effect of tem-
perature evident. The exposed specimen had a
dull green color, suggesting failure of the gold
plate. X-ray analysis showed the film to be
Cr, 0, with no carbon present.

A bright specimen of mild steel lost ~ 170 pug/cm?
during ~150 hr. The rate of weight loss increased
with temperature. The surface was bright at the
end of the test and showed no evidence of carbon
deposition. A rusty specimen of mild steel lost
~ 1500 ug/cm? during ~~ 150 hr, with no consistent
effect of temperature on the rate of weight loss

evident. The surface brightened during the ex-
posure, and x-ray analysis found only FeO present
in the surface film. Since the original specimen
had Fe O, and Fe, 0,-H,0 present, carbon monox-
ide reduction of the oxides seems responsible for
the large weight losses.

The results indicate that carbon is not deposited
on these metal surfaces in this temperature range
from low concentrations of carbon monoxide in
helium containing essentially no hydrogen or water
vapor. The situation could be different in the
presence of the latter.

FISSION.GAS RELEASE FROM PYROLYTIC-
CARBON-COATED FUEL PARTICLES

P. E. Reagan J. G. Morgan

In previous experiments''? we showed that ra-
diation damage to the pyrolytic carbon coating
was due primarily to fission fragments originating
at the core-coating interface. This damage can
be alleviated by providing a gap at the core~
coating interface, by a porous carbon layer, or by
a sacrificial pyrolytic carbon layer. Particles
of dense uo, have been coated (in the ORNL
Metals Division) by techniques
which provide one of these protective measures.

and Ceramics

We have measured fission-gas release rates from
these three kinds of coated particles during
irradiations in the A9, B9, and Cl facilities in
the ORR.? The irradiation temperature, burnup,
and fission-gas release data are given in Table
10.1.

Particles in batch OR-298 had been heat treated
to introduce a gap between the uranium oxide core

relatively thick (82 pu) isotropic coating over the
porous buffer. The fractional fission-gas release,
as shown in Table 10.1, remained very nearly con=
stant throughout the test. Particles from batch
OR-348 were similar to those of OR-354 (porous,
isotropic on an oxide core), but the isotropic
coating was more dense. Initial values for frac-
tional release from the OR-348 particles were
near 1078; the values increased to near 107° by
the end of the test. No bursts of fission gas were
observed. The third batch of particles (batch
OR-HB23) with a porous inner layer were made
with sol-gel uo, cores; * these were coated with
an isotropic layer next to the porous carbon
buffer layer and a granular outer layer. These
particles operated for 25 at. % heavy metal burnup
at 1600°C. The fission-gas telease rates were
quite low (see Table 10.1); they increased by
less than a factor of 2 during the entire test.

inner coating which would shrink away from the
uranium oxide core. These particles had a low-
density (~1.5) pyrolytic carbon coating applied
directly to the core, followed by a higher-density

Table 10.1, the fractional fission-gas release
nearly doubled when the temperature was increased
from 1400 to 1500°C, but it returned to about the
original value when the temperature was again
decreased to 1400°C.

We observed that a correlation could be made
between the degree of contamination in the coat-
ing and the fission-gas release from particles
with unbroken coatings (see Fig. 10.1). This
leads to the conclusion that (below 1400°C) the
fission-gas release from unbroken coatings is
predominantly from contamination in the coating
rather than from the fuel core.? We have found
that coated oxide particles have less contami-
nation in the coating than coated carbide par-
ticles.

each experiment were selected for metallographic
examination.’ The particles made with an in-

OR-298) revealed no failed coatings, although
their behavior during irradiation suggested that
a few particles did fail. Metallographic exami-
nation (see Fig. 10.2) showed that the inner

mained intact. No reaction product was observed

coating failures and only minor microstructural
changes were noted when irradiated particles from
batch OR-348 were examined. The only change in
the coating was a continuous gap that formed at
the core-coating interface. The third batch of
particles with a porous inner layer (OR-HB23)
had been irradiated to 25 at. % uranium burnup at
1600°C. An apparent densification of the porous
catbon layer, as shown in Fig. 10.3, was the only
microstructural change noted in these coatings
after irradiation.

The particles of batch OR-343 were coated in
an experiment to determine whether a low-density
coating applied directly to the UO, core would
shrink during high-temperature irradiation and
provide the gap necessary to relieve the stress
on the coating. This did indeed occur, as is
shown in Fig. 10.4. Although about 20% of the
coatings showed short fractures spiraling into the
inner coating, no failed coatings were observed.

The advantages of the Uo, cores over UC
cores became more obvious when it was observed
that the uo, wonld not convert to uC, as long as
the coating was intact. From our experience with
a variety of coated UO, particles, we conclude
that they are superior to the UC, particles for
the following reasons: (1) the oxide does not
flow at high burnup and expand into voids or

of the irradiation and to measure their ability to
contain fission products. The particles tested
had fuel cores of uc, (Th,U)C,, or uo, with
duplex or triplex pyrolytic carbon coatings. They
were heated to temperatures up to 2000°C in a
flowing helium atmosphere; the furnace com-
ponents were periodically removed for analysis to
measure fission product release as a function of
time and temperature. ®

The release rates obtained in five annealing
experiments at 1370, 1700, and 2000°C are coin-
pated in Table 10.2. The values shown were
averaged over 6 hr of anneal following an initial
1-hr heating period at each temperature. A graph
of the cumulative releases vs time for barium and
strontium from three batches of particles is shown

Though
no systematic and basic study in fission product
release has been made, some trends are evident.
The behavier of triplex pyrolytic-carbon-coated
(Th, UC, particles shows some change with
burnup. Particles irradiated to 8.9% uranium
burnup suffered 2% coating failures during the
initial hour at 1700°C or at 2000°C, while par-
ticles irradiated to 0.29% uranium burnup had no
failures during 19 hr at 2000°C. The lower re-
lease of barium and strontium at the higher burnup
remains without explanation.

Particles of UO, with an outer coating density
of 1.8 g/cm? had higher release rates for barium,
strontium, and cesium, but lower release rates
for cerium and yttrium than did (Th,U)C, particles
with outer coating densities of about 2 g/cm?.
The higher release rates of barium, strontium, and
cerium may be due to the lower-density coating,
while the lower release rates of cerium and
yttrium in the UO, particles may indicate better
retention by the fuel core itself.

POSTIRRADIATION EXAMINATION OF
FUELED GRAPHITE SPHERES

D. R. Cuneo H. E. Robertson
J. G. Morgan C. D. Baumann
E. L. Long, Jr.

We have completed the evaluation of five irra-
diation experiments that contained fueled graphite
elements in the form of spheres. These elements
were fueled with pyrolytic-carbon-coated particles
400 4 in diameter dispersed in a graphite matrix.
A summary of the irradiations is shown in Table
10.3. All of the spheres reported in the table
were 6 cm in diameter except those in experiment
8B-5, which were 17 in. in diameter. The spheres
of interest to the German AVR Pebble Bed Re-
actor Program were fabricated with unfueled outer
shells of machined graphite ot shells molded
around the cote matrix. Two of the spheres were
completely fueled (no unfueled shell).

In addition, we examined two spheres of interest
to the TARGET program. These were spheres of
graphite that contained several drilled holes into
which were poured loose coated particles, Ex-
periment 8B-5 contained eight 17 -in.-diam spheres
which underwent the highest burnups of any
spheres tested (™25 at. % of the heavy metal}.
Metallographic examinations were carried out for
four spheres in this experiment; the remaining
four spheres were duplications of those examined
and were used for compression testing only. We
observed a high percentage of failure of the
laminar-coated particles in two spheres of this
experiment. Laminar-coated particles fabricated
by the same manufacturer but irradiated to about
Y, the burnup were undamaged. Laminar-coated
(U,Th)C, particles made with normal uranium
were found to have coating fractures at the fuel-
coating interface and evidence of loss of crystal-
line detail in the fuel core. This is the only
case of damage we have observed in particles
containing normal uranium. Figure 10.6 is a
photomicrograph of a normal and an enriched
U,Th)C, particle from this experiment. We
found no broken coatings in the spheres that con-
tained either duplex- or triplex-coated fuel par-
ticles. Production-run Carbon Products Division

facture are given in Table 10.4 for spheres irtra-

However, from the large losses in
compression strength (irradiated vs unirradiated
spheres), we conclude that the molded cores
underwent considerable shrinkage, so that the
compression tests reflect only the strength of
the unfueled shell. Such loss of contact between
the core and shell adversely affects the heat
transfer from the core as well as the mechanical
strength of the sphere. The same trends can be
shown for 6-cm-diam spheres, although not to this
extent because of their low burnup.

ceived burnups of from 4500 to 14,900 Mwd per

The element with cladding failure contained

cladding was apparently caused by overpowering
of the element early in the irradiation. Grain
growth in the cladding at the site of failure indi-
cated the presence of a hot spot. Unlike earlier
instances of cladding failure in this series, there
was no evidence of nitride formation in the clad-
ding or columnar grain growth in the fuel.

We have completed the evaluation of an EGCR
prototype capsule which had been irradiated in
the ORR. This element was of special interest
as it contained actual EGCR production-run Uo,
pellets and 304H stainless steel cladding. The
irradiation was carried out at a heat rating of
31,000 Btu hr~! ft~! and a cladding temperature
of 1300°C. The dished-end hollow fuel pellets
achieved a burnup of 10,000 Mwd per metric ton
of Uo, Under these conditions, the cladding
had collapsed around the fuel but no circumferen-
tial ridges were formed. Bowing of the element
was nominal, and there was no shifting of the
fuel. The element had not failed, and its per-
formance was satisfactory under EGCR design
conditions.

tions are consistent with those by other experi-
menters?'® and have led us to a defect-trap theory
of fission-gas release.® This theory postulates
that a defect in the UO, crystal structure will trap
migrating fission gas; the rate of fission-gas es-
cape, accordingly, is controlled by the number of
traps present. Gas-trapping defects consist of in-
herent flaws, such as grain boundaries and internal
pores, in the UO, as well as point defects and
clusters of point defects created as a consequence
of the fission process. Steady-state experiments
with single crystals’ and with polycrystalline
uo, (ref. 8) have supported this defect-trap theory.

We have modified the experimental assembly to
permit a slow, controlled oscillation of the speci-
men through the flux of neutrons.” !? These modi-
fications permit a controlled sinusoidal variation
of neutron flux (fission rate) or specimen tempera-
ture. The fission gas released during the oscilla-
tions is monitored continuously by a gamma-ray
spectrometer. Time dependence of the temperature
(or the fission rate) and of the fission-gas release
rate is measured and recorded by punch-tape read-
out. '1''2 A computer program has been developed
to analyze the fission-gas release waves in terms
of their Fourier components; this analysis yields
amplitude and phase-shift information as a function
of frequency of the oscillation.

The effect of temperature oscillations was ob-
tained by comparing the steady-state release (at
zero frequency) with that at different frequencies.?
The gas release was found to increase as the fre-
quency of oscillations increased; at very ‘slow
oscillations the release rate approached steady-
state levels. This result is predicted by the defect-
trap model; '? that is, as the oscillation frequency

come the trapping effect; the release rate in-
creases and approaches that predicted by models
based upon classical diffusion theory.

Fission-gas release at temperatures below 600°C
occurs primarily by a recoil process wherein fis-
sion fragments passing through the surface of the
UO, specimen eject or “‘knock out’” UO, molecules
along with any fission-gas atoms in the knockout
Knockout release during fission-rate oscil-
lations at a constant temperature of 575°C is
shown in Fig. 11.1. The data points of Fig. 11.1
form a sort of hysteresis curve; arrows by the
data points indicate whether the fission rate was

increasing or decreasing when the data were ob-
tained. The hysteresis curve shows the gas re-
lease rate to be higher during fission-rate oscilla-
tions than when the fission rate was constant.

We suggest that the data of Fig. 11.1 reflect the
rhythmically changing concentration of fission-gas
traps created by the fission process. The cyclic
destruction and creation of traps allow the fission
gas to reach the specimen surface in surges. These
surges account for both the hysteresis and the in-

creased amount of gas at the specimen surface
available for knockout.

MATHEMATICAL MODEL

Material balance equations for fission-gas re-
lease (parent and daughter nuclides) from a thin
slab of fissionable material are based on produc-
tion, loss, and diffusion-leakage terms. In general:

Rate of change of concentration
= diffusion-leakage contribution - loss terms

+ production terms .

For the diffusion-trapping model the loss terms in-
volve radioactive decay and trapping by intrinsic
flaws and point defects. The production terms in-
volve the fission rate, fission yield, and, for the
daughter, radioactive decay of the parent. The
concentration of point defects is a balance be-
tween their rate of formation as a consequence of
fission and their destruction by annealing at high
temperature.
101

Three material balance equations (for which the
symbols are defined in Table 11.1) result; they
are coupled and nonlinear.

At steady state (M/dt = 0H/dt = ON, /dt = 0)
the equations become linear and can be solved by
conventional methods. The steady-state solutions
for the release rates yield expressions which are
similar in appearance to the expressions obtained
from the old diffusion model,'? except that the
decay constant, A, is replaced by an effective
decay constant, \’, which includes the effect of
trapping. An increase in temperature will increase
the rate of trap annealing and will decrease the
effective decay constant, A’. An increase in neu-
tron flux will increase the value of the A”, will tend
to neutralize the increase in production, and will
make the release rate fairly insensitive to flux

least, with the observed phenomena at steady state.

An approximate solution has been obtained for
the case where the flux is varied sinusoidally
while the temperature remains constant. To com-
pate the diffusion-trapping model with the simple
diffusion model, the analytical expressions for the
total release rate transfer functions for each model
were coded for numerical computations. The ampli-
tude of the release rate transfer function vs fre-
quency is shown in Fig. 11.2a. When the diffusion
model is used this amplitude decreases with the
square root of the frequency; when the diffusion-
trapping model is used this amplitude exhibits an
extended plateau in the low frequency range. As
the frequency increases, the frequency-dependent
factors overcome the trapping effects and both

the trapping effect predominates; hence the fre-
quency-dependent terms do not significantly affect
the magnitude of the transfer function.

Equivalent comparisons were made with the phase
shift (Fig. 11.2b) of the transfer function. In the
diffusion model, the phase shift quickly reaches

an asymptotic value of —45° and is independent of

temperature. The phase shift for the diffusion-
trapping model is always smaller, tends
slowly toward the --45° asymptote, and is a func-

Data have been obtained by oscillating the tem-
perature at constant flux; for this case, the equa-

Unit cell dimensions were computed from x-ray
powder patterns using a least-squares fitting pro-
gram written by Williams ® in place of the more
tedious graphical procedure. Test cases showed
no bias due to this change. Comparisons were
also made between the Debye-Scherrer camera
and the bench diffractometer methods of measur-
ing lattice parameters by the powder technique,
Good agreement was found in this case also.

An effort was made to better define the transition
temperature at which orthorhombic U 0, converts
to the face-centered cubic UO,, phase in air.
The transition is sluggish, but the first sign of
the fcc phase appeared at 1528°C and progressed
fairly rapidly (50% in 2 hr) at 1540°C. No fcc
phase was observed after 2 hr at 1514°C. Tem-
perature calibration was felt to be reliable to
+5°C as measured by two independent methods.

During the year, Cohen and Berman of the
Westinghouse Bettis Laboratory reported on this
system® and found a lower urania composition
(50 mole %) for the two-phase boundary at 1200°C
than had been found in this study (“63 mole %).°
In view of this difference, a remeasurement at
1200°C was made using more recent techniques.
No effect could be ascribed to the use of pellets
at 60 mole % urania. This composition showed
some orthorhombic phase (“v2 to 5%). Composi-
tions of 56, 53, and 45% uania displayed no
detectable orthorhombic phase. This indicates
that the phase boundary is between 56 and 60
mole % urania. Composition of 90% urania showed
little change from the older work.

built to extend this study to lower partial pres-
sures of oxygen in the range of 107° atm, where

experimental series are specimens of each of
the monocarbides made by three different methods:
(1) hot pressing, (2) slip casting and sintering,
and (3) explosion pressing. Three low-temperature

one instrumented high-temperature (1100°C) assem-

Examination is complete for an assembly of one
sample of each of the five hot-pressed monocar-

about 100°C.7 Most of the specimens sustained
very little gross damage. Metallographic examina-

measured from x-ray patterns obtained from reflec-
tions from polished surfaces. The gross volume ex-
pansion of the tungsten carbide specimen, the
only one of the five carbides which does not have
an isotropic crystal structure, was only about
0.3%. The gross volume expansicns of the cubic
carbides of titanium, tantalum, and zirconium
were much greater (2.6%); the lattice expansion
accounts for about 60 to 75% of the gross ex-
pansion of the titanium and zirconium carbides.
An x-ray pattern could not be obtained on tan-
talum carbide. The niobium carbide sample ap-
peared to expand more than the others, but its
lattice parameter expansion was very small.

These preliminary results indicate that refrac-
tory-mefal carbides are sufficiently resistant to
fast neutrons to merit consideration for nuclear
applications involving high neutron doses. Tung-
sten carbide, in particular, is attractive because
of its small lattice parameter expansion and
small gross volume expansion. The magnitudes
of these expansions are generally reliable indi-
cations of the degree of neutron damage.

a severe deterioration which, it seems likely,
would be accompanied by a loss in strength.

In-pile annealing at high temperatures reduces
the volume expansion and lattice parameter ex-
pansion of MgO. Thermal stresses within neutron-
damaged compacts probably account for the mark-
edly greater gross damage observed in irradiations

A comparison of the lattice parameter expansions
of the three oxides irradiated at low temperatures
to a dose of ~10%! neutrons/cm? is shown in
Table 12.2. The a and c parameters of ALO,
expanded by about the same amount under these
conditions; this is in sharp contrast to the behav-
ior of Be(, in which nearly all the expansion is
in the c parameter. Recent irradiations of trans-
lucent ALO, specimens (J.ucalox) to somewhat
higher doses {~1.4 x 102! neutrons/cm?) pro-
duced a greater expansion of c¢ parameter, how-
ever, and resulted in an anisotropic expansion
ratio (Ac/cy)/(Aa/ay) of about 3.8. This ratio,
however, is small compared with that for BeO.
Therefore, the mechanisms through which ALLO,
is fractured during fast-neutron irradiation appear
to be the same as in MgO.

Neutron damage to all three oxides, as judged
from lattice parameter expansion and gioss vol-
ume expansion, decreases with increasing irradi-
ation temperature. Because of in-pile thermal
stress, however,
Al,0, increased markedly at high temperatures
(1100°C). Therefore, to minimize damage to these
oxides in nuclear reactor application, the temper-
ature should be maintained as high as practicable,
and the system should be designed so as to mini-
mize thermal stress. In the case of BeO, thermal
cycling, which tends to promote grain-boundary
separation, should also be avoided.

THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY CHANGES
OF CERAMICS

C. D. Bopp

The annealing of the neutron-induced thermal
conductivity change has been measured in several
ceramic materials. The annealing temperatures are
listed in Table 12.3. A fluxmeter apparatus?3
was used with the materials of high conductivity,
and a mercury-contact apparatus ?* was used with
the materials of lower conductivity. Previously,?®
the mercury-contact apparatus was used for pre-
and postirradiation measurements of these same
materials, but annealing was not studied. Com-
parison with the present results shows good
agreement except in the instance of thin speci-
mens of beryllia, for which it appears that the
mercury-contact apparatus is unsuitable because
of the extremely high conductivity of this mate-
rial. The annealing temperatures for beryllia
shown in Table 12.3 are in good agreement with
those found by other workers?® for material given
nearly the same irradiation dosage.

saturating solid phase was identified by petro-

THE OSMOTIC BEHAVIOR OF SIMULATED
SEA-SALT SOLUTIONS AT 123°C

P. B. Bien B. A. Soldano

The isopiestic technique previously developed
at ORNL? has been used to test the behavior of
three simulated sea-salt solutions at 123°C.
The tests were made to assess the applicability
of calculation methods proposed for determining
thermodynamic properties, including the vapor
pressures, of solutions of interest to the vacuum-
distillation process for desalination of sea-
water.

The three sea-salt solutions were prepared to
simulate closely the ‘‘standard seawater’ defined
by K. S. Spiegler.® In order to avoid the evolution
of gases and possible corrosion in the vapor
chamber, the troublesome univalent anions HCO ,~
and Br were replaced by equivalent quantities of
chloride ion. Solution A was further modified by
replacing the calcium with magnesium, thereby
the magnesium concentration to
0.06451 m; the sulfate concentration in solution A
was kept at 0.02856 m. Solution B was modified
further by completely removing the calcium to-
gether with an equivalent amount of sulfate; the
sulfate concentration in solution B was thus re-
duced to a concentration of 0.01822 m. Saline C
was not modified except by the replacement of
chloride for the bicarbonate and bromide. Thus,
the compositions of the three solutions were:

Four dishes of each solution, four dishes of NaCl
standard solution, and four dishes containing
standard weights for internal calibration of the
balance were loaded into the chamber together
with a larger dish containing NaCl solution which

served as a buffer reservoir. After the air was
evacuated from the sealed chamber, the apparatus
was brought to and held at 123°C. Each day, the
weights of every dish were recorded as readings
on an electrically operated magnetic balance,
after which a small amount of steam was vented
from the apparatus, thus increasing the concen-
trations of all the test, standard, and buffer solu
tions. The changes in the concentrations of the
test solutions were inferred from the changes in
the weights of the dishes. The ionic strengths of
the solutions were then calculated from the formula

test soln

tion of I. are given as follows:

R, = 0.7701 + 0.0879 - 0.004717; , = 0.0292,

Plots of these equations, as shown in Fig. 13.2,
suggested that solution C was clearly different
in behavior from solutions A and B. The con-
siderable overlap between solutions A and B
suggested that a more sensitive test could be
made of the possible significance of any dif-
ference between them. To this end, the hypothesis
was made that the solutions did not differ, and
a t test was applied to the 26 values of I, — I
obtained from the data in Table 13.2. An average
value of the difference found was 0.077 unit of
ionic strength (not units of R); this difference

was found to be well above the 0.001 level of
significance.

Marshall al.” have recently shown that
calcium sulfate should begin to precipitate from
seawater at about 117°C. Therefore, it is likely
that all the tests with solution C were performed
in the presence of solid CaSO, (anhydrite) and
that, consequently, the data for solution C should
not be suitable for analysis until and unless
accurate values for the solubility of the come

et

ponents make it possible to infer the true solu-
tion composition. It may be noted, however, that
the values of R calculated from the true solution
composition should be higher than those plotted
in Fig. 13.2, probably bringing the data more
closely in line with those of solutions A and B.
The difference between A and B was observed
to be quite consistent over the whole concentra-
tion range, and the average value of this dif-
ference, 0.077 ionic strength unit, is about twice
the value calculated for the solutions as made up

at room temperature, 0.0414. The solubilities of

the components of solutions A and B have not
vet been determined as a function of concentration,
and it is still assumed that no precipitation took
place in the dishes containing these solutions.

With respect to the original objective, that of
testing the proposed method of calculating vapor
pressures of saline waters, solutions A and B
may not be sufficiently different to permit good
evaluation of such a method. Further tests should
be made with solutions known to be phase stable
at elevated temperatures and probably should
begin with simpler systems such as those con-
taining mixtures of NaCl and Na, SO, or mixtures
of NaCl and MgCl.

ALUMINUM- AND TITANIUM-ALLOY CORROSION

The studies of the corrosion of aluminum and
titanium alloys in sodium chloride solutions have
continued. They have included investigations ‘in
the 100-gpm titanium loops,’ the small titanium
electrochemical loop, '? and conventional labora-
tory equipment. It was found necessary to modify
the electrode assembly in the small titanium loop
to reduce troublesome IR drops; this entailed
providing coaxial polarizing electrodes and dual
reference electrodes as shown in Fig. 13.3.

Galvanostatic polarization studies of the cor-
rosion of the 5454 (27% Mg, 0.8% Mn, 0.1% Cr,
< 0.01% Cu) and 6061 (1.0% Mg, 0.6% Si, 0.25% Cu,
0.25% Cr) aluminum alloys in 1 M NaCl at 150°C
have been carried out in this equipment.!! The
results obtained were generally similar to those
obtained by other workers at lower temperatures.
Thus, a pronounced minimum exists in the cor-
rosion rate of aluminum and its. alloys in chloride
solutions in the vicinity of neutrality. Changes

with pH in the polarization curves of anodic and
cathodic processes occurring at the aluminum-
electrolyte interface provide a kinetic basis for
understanding this and other aspects of the cor-
rosion behavior. At low potentials, the rate of
the anodic or corrosion reaction is independent of
the electrode potential, but it increases with
increasing pH. The rate of the anodic process is
controlled by the rate of mass transport of hy-
droxide ions to the oxide-solution interface, At
higher potentials, in the presence of chloride
ions, the anodic-polarization curve exhibits a
pitting potential which independent of the
anodic current density. The pitting potential
does not vary with pH, but decreases with in-
creasing chloride concentration. The cathodic
reaction in alkaline solution consists of the re-
duction

is

of water molecules to form molecular
hydrogen; this process is pH independent. With
increasing acidity, reduction of hydrogen ions be~
comes increasingly important. The minimum cor-
rosion rate represents a compromise between the
decrease in the rate of the transport-controlled
anodic reaction with increasing acidity and the
increase in the rate of the cathodic hydrogen-
evolution reaction. Oxygen in solution may also
increase the corrosion rate by providing an addi-
tional cathodic process.

Comparison of polarization curves of the 5454
and 6061 alloys shows that the rate of the cathodic
hydrogen-evolution reaction of the 6061 alloy is
considerably greater than that of the 5454 alloy.
The enhanced rate of the cathodic process on the
6061 alloy accounts for its greater corrosion rate
at any pH and for its susceptibility to pitting
attack. Catalysis of the cathodic process on the
6061 alloy may be attributable to its copper
content. It is hypothesized that accumulation of
copper at the metal-oxide interface as corrosion
progresses results in pit formation.

These studies stemmed from results obtained
in the 100-gpm titanium loops, which showed
gross pitting of 6061 alloy specimens after 248-hr
exposure to pH 6.0, 1 # NaCl at 150°C. Under
comparable conditions, the 5454 alloy showed
uniform attack after 1620-hr exposure; continuing
corrosion rates were 6 mils/year at 7 to 25 fps.
Similar results are being cbtained at 100°C; 6061
specimens show pitting attack after 500 to 1500
hr, whereas 5454 specimens show uniform attack
with continuing corrosion rates of ~1 mil/year
after ~2800-hr exposure,

Investigations of the severe corrosion of titanium
in saline waters, reported last year, have also
continued. Three racks of specimens are being
exposed in the water box of the No. 1 effect at
the Freeport Desalination Plant. In this location,
the specimens are exposed to near-normal con-
centration, pH ~7.5 brine (sulfuric acid treated
and neutralized for scale prevention) at 129 to
138°C. Racks have been examined at 12-, 32-,
and 82-day intervals and have all shown negligible
to severe attack in areas of contact with Teflon;
no attack was observed in metal-to-metal contact
areas, This was consistent with the previously
noted promotion of attack by contact with Teflon.
It appears likely that this results from the release
of small amounts of fluoride ion!? by the Teflon.
Anodic polarization studies have shown that as
little as 12 ppm fluoride substantially increases
the active corrosion rate and the rate of activation
of titanium.

It is also likely that the absence of more general
attack on the rack specimens stemmed from the
somewhat low temperature of exposure — the bulk
of the exposure was at temperatures less than
138°C. The previously noted dominant importance

of temperature was reemphasized by recent ex-
perience with 100-gpm titanium-loop piping. For-
mation of several large pits was observed during
operation at temperature 2150°C. Subsequently,
the loop has been operated at 100°C for ~2800 hr
with no apparent further attack. A similar pit
initiated in another part of the loop penetrated the
0.2-in. pipe wall after approximately 5400 hr at
150°C and after 300 hr at 200°C, 1!

A particularly significant point concerning the
very sharp temperature dependence has just been
discovered. This is that the breakdown or pitting
potential for titanium, reported as ~10 v in roome
temperature chloride solutions, !3 has a very sharp
temperature dependence. Studies in the small
titanium electrochemical loop showed pitting po~
tentials at plus 500 mv (vs S.C.E.) or less for
commercially pure titanium at temperatures of
150°C and above. Laboratory and loop electro-
chemical studies have shown this sharp tempera-
ture dependence over the range 25 to 190°C. The
actual potentials measured and temperature de-
pendence, however, are greatly influenced by
alloy composition and surface condition, so no
quantitative data will be presented at this time.

and affects the efficiency. The problem is
economic: scale control costs probably should
not exceed a few cents per 1000 gal. This elimi-
nates many technologically feasible processes,
unless salable by-products are produced.

Raw-materials costs alone appear to be too high
for most processes except those using compounds
of carbon ot sulfur. Sulfuric acid addition is
conventionally used to prevent the formation of
calcium carbonate or magnesium hydroxide scale
and permits operation up to temperatures near
250°F. Calcium sulfate may precipitate above
this temperature.

The prevention of alkaline scale in seawater
heaters by means of carbon dioxide additions
has been supgested. Ellis'* observed the effect
of carbon dioxide pressure on the solubility of
calcite in various sodium chloride solutions at
elevated temperatures. Thermodynamic equilibrium
constants and mean activity coefficients of cal-
cium and bicarbonate ions were reported. We
adapted these findings to the composition and
alkalinity of standard seawater, assuming that
the solutions and activity coefficients are similar
at equal ionic strengths. It was thus estimated
that the addition of 0.9 1b of CO, per 1000 gal
of seawater feed, corresponding to a CO, partial
pressure of 0.09 aim at 25°C, might prevent
calcite precipitation up to 125°C (257°F). In a
once~through flash-evaporator system, alkaline
scale would precipitate in the brine bulk as
carbon dioxide flashed in the first stage. Heating
surfaces would not be fouled, and co, might be
recycled without compressors.

association of sulfate, bicarbonate, and carbonate
ions with magnesium and sodium and also with
calcium ions. Qur preliminary estimates for
100°C have indicated that magnesium sulfate pait
formation will be greater at the increased tempeta-
ture. Calcium sulfate is similarly affected to a
lesser extent. These phenomena may also affect
the application to seawater problems of the studies
of Marshall, Slusher, and Jones!® on the solu-
bility of calcium sulfate in sodium chloride solu-
tions.

The economic removal of calcium sulfate
scaling tendencies may be possible by thermal
precipitation techniques in which seawater is
heated to a temperature of calcium sulfate super-
saturation; precipitation may be facilitated by
contacting with calcium sulfate particles. An
understanding of ionic and solubility equilibria
and precipitation kinetics are needed to provide
a rational basis for an economic process using
this technique.

The rate of precipitation from a supersaturated
solution is affected by mass transfer to the crystal
surface, reaction with surface sites, and nue
cleation of new particles. Without nucleation, the
rate cannot exceed that of mass transfer. Co-
efficients for mass transfer to particles were
related by Harriott!” to that for a single freely
falling sphere in the given liquid. The coefficient
decreases as particle size increases up to about
100 px and changes little thereafter. For anhydrite
crystallization from standard seawater with about
10°F superheating, we estimated that the mass-
transfer limitation would permit growth rates up
to several centimeters per hour. Such rates would
permit an effective unit for removing calcium sul-
fate from seawater to be designed.

Neilsen!?® has indicated that, as supersaturation
is decreased and the surface reaction becomes
limiting, crystallization rates decrease more than
the concentration by a substantial proportion.
On the other hand, if the concentration is in-
creased and high levels of supersaturation are
reached, undesirably rapid nucleation is to be
anticipated. Thus, the supersaturation must be

fer for the most effective operation of ‘‘contact-
stabilization’’ equipment.

In addition to capital and heat costs of the
contact-stabilization process, pumping-energy costs
may be appreciable. At higher temperatures, a
higher head is required in order to pressurize the

120

feed to prevent boiling. For example, at 330°F
the vapor pressure of water is 103 psi, and about
1 kwhr is required to pump 1000 gal of feed
against this head. The maximum economic tem-
perature is thus limited by the exponential rise
in vapor pressure.

2-methyltetrahydrofuran in both dihydrofuran and
cyclohexene suggests that tetrahydrofuran gives
higher yields than the 2-methyl compound.

Evaporation of the irradiated mixtures indicated
that over 20% of the original materials had been
converted to nonvolatile residue at doses of about
4 x 108 rads. Initial yields in terms of consump-
tion of dihydrofuran in mixtures with methyltetra-
hydrofuran were estimated at G values (molecules
per 100 ev) of about 10.

 

Infrared spectra indicated the formation of small
quantities of hydroxy and carbonyl compounds.
Mixtures of telogens with furan and 2,5-dimethyl-
furan gave very little 1:1 or higher telomer,
probably because of resonance stabilization of the
furan ring.

Further work will involve identifying the products
indicated by gas chromatography and measurement
of yields at elevated temperatures.
15. Fluoride Studies for Other ORNL Programs

THE CHEMISTRY OF CHROMIUM IN THE
FLUORIDE YOLATILITY PROCESS

B. J. Sturm R. E. Thoma

In earlier versions of the Fluoride Volatility
Process, volatile UF, was obtained by fluorina-
tion of fluoride melts in which solid fuel elements
had been dissolved by treatment with HF, For
zirconium-! aluminum-based? fuel elements
the method worked well because the available low-
melting salt mixtures permitted the fluorination
at temperatures of 600°C or lower, where corrosion
was not severe. Fuel elements with matrices and
claddings of stainless steel proved less tractable;
a process in which UF _ is recovered by volatiliza-
tion from a fluidized bed instead of a melt® looks
promising for these fuels. Uranium hexafluoride
from both processes is purified by adsorption-
desorption cycles on beds of Nal,

In the fluidized-bed procedure the fuel elements
are supported in a fluidized alumina powder, which

or

acts as a heat transfer medium, and are decom-
posed by treatment with HF-0, mixtures. Uranium
is then recovered as UF by fluorination. When
chromium, an important constituent of stainless
steel, reacts with the HF-O, mixture, it forms
nonvolatile oxides and fluorides. On fluorination,
chromium is oxidized to higher valence, and large
quantities of its volatile fluorides and oxyfluorides
form. These compounds might volatilize with
and contaminate the recovered UF _. Little is
known of these volatile compounds of chromium.

chromium compounds which may affect the new
method.

Synthesis of CF,

Free-energy estimates* indicated that the re-

might be used for synthesizing CrF,. In laboratory
tests, we found that dense blue-black CF, vapors
were evolved above 400°C, the boiling point of the
compound, when equimolar amounts of the re-
actants were present or when there was an excess
of AgF..

Reaction of Chromium Fluorides with NaF

Since UF, is purified by absorption on NaF
beds, the behavior of chromium fluorides with NaF
was studied, Two compounds, 3NaF - CrF, and
SNaF -3CiF ,, formed during the crystallization
of molten NaF-CrF, mixtures containing less
than 50 mole % CiF,. The former compound (ap-
parently a structural analog of cryolite) exists in
two crystal modifications. The high-temperature
form melted reproducibly at 1090°C and exhibited
a range of solid-solution stoichiometry, The low
temperature form is biaxial, with an average re-
fractive index of 1.411, X-ray diffraction pattems
from SNaF - 3CrF powder suggest that the com=
pound, melting incongruently at 800°C, is iso-
morphous with chiolite (5NaF -3AIF.). In the

tem NaF-CtlF | has two invariant points: a eutectic

An NaF-CiF’, phase was synthesized by expos-
ing granulated NaF to Crk, vapor at 400 to 500°C
in a controlled-atmosphere glove box. This product
had a face-centered cubic structure with a lattice
constant of 7,90 A, Since it is isostructural with

Behavior of CrO,F,

Chromium oxyfluoride has been prepared® by
reaction of CoF, and CrO, and has been exposed
in the vapor state for 0.5 hr at 80°C to several of
the materials expected to contact the Fluoride
Volatility Process gas streams. Sodium fluoride
reacted with the CO, F, to produce an (as yet
unidentified) yellow-orange compound. Aluminum
fluoride, UF, and UO, showed no evidence of
reaction.

Equilibrinm data’? for the reaction

2HF(g) + C10,(s) & CrO,F (8) + H,0(9)

suggest that AG for solid CrO,F, at 298°K should
be near —189 kcal/mole. From this value one
predicts that CrOF, should oxidize CtF to CrF,
Uo, to UQ,, and (by 2 kcal per gram atom of F)
UF, to UF_. No tests of the first two reactions
have been made; UF, was not oxidized to UF,
during the relatively mild exposures above.

16. Chemical Support for the

Controlled Thermonuclear Research Program

R. A. Strehlow

Whether controlled thermonuclear devices with
useful power densities are feasible is a question
which can be conveniently divided into two prin~
cipal parts. The first part asks whether a plasma
fuel element can be constructed; that is, whether

the physics of plasma confinement can be solved”

in a practical way. The second part, which is more
obscure, asks whether there is any fundamental
bar to construction of a thermonuclear reactor if
the confinement problem is solvable, We have
continued to study chemical aspects of both parts
of this question.

Our studies in support of the confinement prob-
lems are directed toward development of tech-
niques to diagnose the quality of the plasma
environment in experimental devices and to assist
in attempts to improve this quality. Such pursuits
have dominated our chemical studies.'™? In addi-
tion, an extensive literature survey and an experi-
mental study have been devoted to possible prob-
lems of tritium inventory and the fuel cycle of a
thermonuclear reactor. Some of our special equip-
ment was also used to assist in the design (by
ORNL Isotopes Division personnel) of an isotope
separator of a new and improved type. Each of
these portions of our effort is described briefly
in the following.

VACUUM ANALYSIS IN AN EXPERIMENTAL
PLASMA DEVICE

R. A, Strehlow

A simple mass-spectrometric assembly has been
installed and operated routinely to yield a continu-
ing record of vacuum conditions during operation
of the plasma device DCX-2. About 2500 mass
spectra have been obtained in this study since
installation of this residual-gas analyzer in Feb-
ruary 1965. Such data have proved helpful in
assaying various pumping and operating parameters
of DCX-2; such species as acetylene, trichloro-
ethylene, methane, ethane, alcohols, and vapors
of metals (such as Zn) can be detected unambig-
uously. The mass spectra alone are insufficient
to yield a real diagnosis of the DCX-2 vacuum
environments since, in many cases, the origin of
the observed species is more important than the
fact of its presence. Accordingly, a study is under
way of the effect of processes within DCX-2 upon
the mass spectrum obtained from pertinent materials,

For this study a second mass-analyzer assembly,
similar to that on DCX-2, has been installed on a
simple, large vacuum system whose construction
materials, assembly methods, pumps, pump oils,
etc., are similar to those of DCX-2. This assembly
permits study of the effects of various analyzer
instrument parameters (electron-accelerating volt-
age and ion-source assembly procedure, for example)
on the spectrum observed. More important, how-
ever, it permits study of the effect of processes
such as electron and ion bombardment, temperature
fluctuations, titanium getter evaporation, and
others used in DCX-2 on the mass spectrum ob-
served,

With this assembly, mass-spectrometric studies
have been made of the effect of warming liquid-
nitrogen-cooled surfaces,!** of hot-filament reac-
tions and electron bombardment of contaminated
surfaces,? and of reactions of titanium in vacuum
systems.® Recent studies have dealt with the
formation of products from bombardment with hydro-
gen ions during glow discharges within the as-
sembly. These studies suggest that acetylene is
observed, in addition to methane, only when a
trisiloxane oil is present in the bombarded materials.
Acetylene, previously observed in DCX-2 during
ion injection of H,* into the assembly, is now be-
lieved to be evidence of contamination by this
pump-oil component,

INTERACTION OF TRITIUM WITH
THERMONUCLEAR-REACTOR MATERIALS

S. S. Kirslis

For a thermonuclear reactor to be feasible, the
holdup of tritium in the metal of the containment
vessel (probably molybdenum or tungsten) and in
that of the ion sources (alloys of nickel or iron)
must not result in excessive tritium inventory and
decay losses. The equilibrium solubility of hydro-
gen in these metals at low pressures is low. How-
ever, the metals can be cathodically ‘‘surcharged’’
with hydrogen to amounts of the order of 100 cm?®
(NTP)/g; this is sufficient to cause, in some
cases, blistering and cracking of the metal. In
order to judge more clearly whether the metal in
a reactor under bombardment by energetic tritium
atoms might be surcharged with tritium, a literature
study of the various possible surface and interior
diffusion processes has been made; this survey
will be published separately.

The 50- to 100-kev tritium atoms may be ex-
pected to penetrate the metal to their range depth
of 1 to 2 x 107% cm. They presumably diffuse
inward (and also back to the entrance surface)
according to normal diffusion laws. If there is
no appreciable barrier to their egress at the sur-
face, the concentration of tritium atoms just in-
side the metal will be low or zero. If all this is
true, the steady-state concentration of tritium in

“D, M. Richardson and R. A. Strehlow, Trans. Natl.
Vacuum Symp., 10th, 1963, p. 97.

128

the metal will have a peak at the range depth and
will fall off to low values at the bombarded sur-
face and at the far surface of the metal. The
average concentration in the metal would be half
the peak concentration. If a barrier to egress of
tritium from the bombarded surface exists, the
whole steady-state concentration curve would cor-
respondingly rise to higher tritium concentrations,
The factors determining the peak concentration of
tritium are the flux of atoms to the metal, the dif-
fusion constant of tritium in the metal, and the
boundary condition for the degassing of the bom-
barded metal surface.

Information on hydrogen diffusion in the metals
of interest was derived mainly from published
permeability and solubility studies. For informa-
tion on the degassing boundary condition, the
literature was searched in the fields of chemisorp-
tion and desorption, catalysis, hydrogen-electrode
behavior, and hydrogen-atom recombination, Other
pertinent information was obtained from published
studies of ion bombardment, spuftering of metal
surfaces, and saturation of metals by proton or
deuteron bombardment.

The conclusions of the literature study are as
follows:

1. Hydrogen is easily degassed at low pressures
and moderate temperatures, even from metals
(such as tungsten) for which the chemisorption
heats are high.

Cathodic surcharging depends on the poisoning
of the metal surface for hydrogen-atom recombi-
nation. In a gaseous environment on clean
metals, hydrogen-atom recombination is rapid.
Diffusion rates for hydrogen in molybdenum at
600 to 800°C are sufficiently rapid to deliver
injected atoms rapidly back to the bombarded
surface, thus maintaining a very low (and from
a practical viewpoint, negligible) concentration
of hydrogen in the metal. The same is expected
to be true for tritium, If the hydrogen concen-
tration will indeed be as low as estimated from
the simple diffusion model, it should cause no
hydrogen embrittlement problems. Since the
diffusion constants for nickel and iron are much
higher than those of molybdenum, high internal
hydrogen concentrations are not expected even
at much lower temperatures,

Some recent work on deuteron bombardment of
metals indicates higher concentrations of
deuterium just inside the metal surface than
129

predicted by the simple model. Some evidence
indicates this may be the effect of surface
contamination on the metal.

HYDROGEN SURCHARGING OF MOLYBDENUM
IN A GLOW DISCHARGE

D. M. Richardson

A study of hydrogen occlusion by a molybdenum
cathode in a glow discharge has been conducted.
The principal objective of this work was to assess
the significance of hydrogen surcharging to design
considerations for thermonuclear reactors. Initial
studies had indicated a possible hydrogen content
of one or more atmospheric cubic centimeters per
cubic centimeter of metal after bombardment in a
discharge. Though this concentration of hydrogen
is less than 0.1 at. %, even this low value could,
if it were typical of the concentration in a large
fraction of the reactor, present serious problems
to the reactor designer. The work described here
and the literature study summarized above, how-
ever, have led to the conclusion that, at elevated
temperatures, occlusion of hydrogen is not large.
At lower temperatures it appears that surface
contamination can markedly impede the recombina-
tion of hydrogen during even low-energy bombard-
ment; very high hydrogen concentrations in the
metal are able, therefore, to be achieved.

For these studies, a 45-cm length of molybdenum
wire 1 mm in diameter was used as a cathode in a
cylindrical tank with a volume of 200 liters. The
ends of the tank were electrically shielded with
sheet Teflon, The center of the tank was con-
nected to a vacuum system through a 6-in, isolation
gate valve and a gate valve with a small orifice
which had a speed of 2 x 107* the speed of the
vacunm-~system manifold. This allowed a steady
introduction of hydrogen gas through a palladium
leak to the glow discharge chamber at a pressure
of 1072 to 1 torr with continuous mass analysis
of the effluent gas from this chamber. The gas
during the usual discharge contained not more than
1 part per thousand of nonhydrogen impurity.

The conditions for the usual low-temperature
discharge are summarized in Table 16.1. The total
bombardment for the conditions shown was 12
amp-sec or about 1 to 3 atm-cm® of hydrogen gas.
After opening the valve and pumping down to a

pressure of about 1 x 1077 tom, the wire was
heated to redness. Mass-gpectrometric and ion
gage observations were made of the hydrogen
evolved by the degassing process. Pressure rises
of as much as 6 x 10™* torr were observed during
the 4-sec degassing procedure, Since the system
pumping speed for hydrogen was about 1000 liters/
sec, this pressure rise corresponded to about 2
atm-cm® of hydrogen,

Stringent cleaning of the wire and ion bombard
ment of the chamber walls for several hours, fol.
lowed by repetition of the discharge, led to a value
of only 0.017 atm-cm®, Continued repetitions of
the discharge-degas cycle led to increasing amounts
of hydrogen being occluded. Since the wire was
fiot heated past 1000°C, a gradual increase in
surface contamination could have been responsible
for the very high values,

Several attempts were made at higher current
densities (and consequent high temperatures) to
determine the amount of hydrogen occluded during
a usual discharge. None of these attempts led to
an evolution of hydrogen in detectable amounts.

Molybdenum surfaces which are clean or which
are heated do not seem to occlude large quantities
of hydrogen during low~intensity bombardment
with protons.

MEASUREMENT OF GAS LOAD FROM SOURCE
OF ELECTROMAGNETIC SEPARATOR

R. A. Stehlow

Scientists of the ORNL Isotopes Division are
designing an improved electromagnetic isotope
separator. This separator, a considerably modified
calutron, is to have separate differential pumping
systems for the source, collector, and main-vacuum-
tank regions. For design of these pumping systems,
130

it was necessary to know the gas load upon each;
that from the source was judged to require experi-
mental measurement.

ORNL electromagnetic separators use, where
possible, vapor of the chloride of the element
whose isotopes are to be separated. This chloride
is generated within the source assembly by chlori-
nation with CCl, of the appropriate metal or oxide.
The gas load from the source assembly, therefore,
consists almost entirely of unreacted CCl |.

A flow-rate meter with a constant (regulated)
pressure and variable volume, capable of operation
with condensable gases and at low pressures, was
adapted for this study. This device, designed to
measure flow rates as low as 10~° torr-liter/min
for the thermonuclear support program, was installed
near the source region of a calutron. The CCl,
flow rate from this unit was monitored during a run
in which the isotopes of cerium were being sep-
arated. The measured flow rate, higher by neatly
an order of magnitude than that previously esti-
mated, has been used in design of the differential
pumping system for the source of the new unit,

APPEARANCE-POTENTIAL MEASUREMENTS
FROM TIME-QF-FLIGHT MASS SPECTROMETRY

J. D. Redman

Polymeric species are commonly observed in the
vapor of simple and of mixed metal halides. We
hope to assist in interpreting mass spectra from
such halide vapors by determining appearance
potentials of the various ions formed by electron
impact with the vapor species evolving from an
effusion cell. A preliminary stage of this work
has been completed with the construction of a
retarding-potential circuit and its application to
the study, with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer,
of various gases to assess its reliability. This
assessment was considered necessary, even though
application of retarding-potential-difference methods
to this type of spectrometer has been demonstrated,
to determine whether gases introduced at the low
pressures corresponding to the expected flux of
salt-vapor species would yield appearance poten~
tials with satisfactory precision.

were obtained from ionization-efficiency curves,
nomalized for this systematic deviation at onset,
obtained in the standardization with krypton.
Typical normalized jonization-efficiency plots are
shown in Fig. 16.1 for krypton and ethane frag-
ments. Our values for other appearance potentials
are compared in Table 16.2 with those obtained
by others. We fail to check the published values
for the cH,” and cu’ fragments from butane,
but agree quite satisfactorily with published values
for all others studied.

Since the operating source pressure was main»
tained at 5 x 1077 to 1 x 107% torr in these studies,
we believe that vapor fluxes from effusion cells
containing metal halides will prove adequate for
the planned investigation. It is likely that temper-
ature control of the effusion-cell system will be
of prime importance,

The program attempts to measure and inter-
pret the effect upon fission product release of

teristics of the transient. The extent of reaction
of the cladding and of the UO, fuel with the cover-

Behavior on Melting in Steam

Analysis of two experiments which used atmos-
pheres of 1000 psia steam (285°C) has been re-
ported elsewhere.? One experiment used a spec-

exposure in TREAT the cladding melted, oxidized
extensively, slumped in a spongy mass, and ad-
hered to the unmelted UO, pellets. Fission product
release from fuel and cladding was much less
than that inh an earlier experiment, which used
previously unirradiated stainless-steel-clad UO, in
45-psi argon atmosphere, where the cladding flowed
completely off of the unmelted UO, pellets. Appar-
ently, the layer of oxidized cladding formed by the

high-pressure steam provided an effective barrier
to fission product release.

The second experiment used a specimen with
Zircaloy-2 cladding on the UO, fuel; after the

exposure, fuel and cladding were found to be
fragmented and dispersed within the alumina
crucible. Direct comparison of fission product

release from the stainless-steel- and the Zircaloy-
clad specimens cannot be made since plugged
tubing prevented release of steam from the auto-
clave after the transient with the Zircaloy-clad
specimen. However, the distribution of fission
ptoducts within the fuel autoclave showed that
the release was greater for the Zircaloy-clad
specimen; this must be considered at present to
be a result of the fragmentation.

Behavior on Melting Under Water

The first two of a series of experiments have
been performed with the TREAT reactor in order
to study the release of fission products from fuel
melted underwater. The experiments used stainless-
steel- and Zircaloy-2-clad UO, fuel specimens
irradiated to 18 Mwd/metsic ton. An initial specimen
temperature of 70°C was used, and operating and
reactor-transient conditions for the two experiments
were identical. Heat input to the fuel during the
transients was approximately 500 cal per gram of
uo, (50% greater than any previously used); the
U0, was heated to well above its melting point.

The experiments were designed to simulate tran-
sient accidents with water-cooled reactors in which
steam and water are expelléd from the core vessel.
Valves were opened immediately after the transient,
and the transient-generated steam and a purge of
argon gas were permitted to flow through a con-
denser, water-collection traps, filters, and a
charcoal bed into a gas-collection tank. The fuel-
containing autoclave was then electrically heated
136

to 350°C maximum for 1 hr to slowly boil excess veesazs
water out of the fuel autoclave.

The release and distribution of fission products
were essentially the same in the two experiments.
The fuel specimens melted completely (Figs. 17.1
and 17.2). Fission product release to the fuel
autoclave was high, but transport of fission products
out of the autoclave by steam release and argon
purge was relatively small. The 129Te, 137Cs,
and !3! carried out of the fuel autoclave ranged
from 2 to 7%. The transported release of non-
volatile materials (°°Zr, !'*!Ce, and UO.) was
only 0.1%. Approximately 0.005% of the !3'I
reached the filter papers and charcoal bed.

Most of the transient-generated steam condensed
in the fuel autoclave, and only a small amount
was immediately discharged through the condenser.
The water inside the fuel autoclave was an excellent
trap for the fission products since slow evapora-
tion of the remaining water (simulating accident
after-heat) did not transport large amounts of
fission products. Approximately 1 liter of hydrogen
was produced in each experiment by reaction
between cladding and water; this resulted in a
chemically reducing atmosphere for most fission
products.

Metallographic examination of portions of the
melted fuel samples showed the formation of a
eutectic phase in the specimen with stainless
steel cladding. The major phase in the sample
from the Zircaloy-2-clad specimen was a solid
solution of approximately 75% UO, and 25% Z10,.

Two additional experiments were recently per-
formed with fuel specimens and reactor transients
similar to those described above. The initial
temperature was increased and the argon purge was
eliminated in order to have quicker and more com-
plete release of steam from the fuel autoclave in
the first minute following the transients. Examina-
tion of these experiments is in progress.

attainment of controlled temperatures (through
nuclear heating of the small fuel specimen) to and
above the melting point of uo, with any of sev-
eral atmospheres. The release and the subsequent
deposition of eight fission products (I, Te, Cs, Ru,
Sr, Ba, Zr, and Ce) are determined in each of the
experiments. Results of these investigations are
published in detail elsewhere.”

The atmospheres that have been investigated
include helium, moist helium, steam-helium-hydro-
gen mixtures, dry air, moist air, and steam-air
mixtures. Of the eight elements measured, only
iodine and ruthenium showed significant variations
in behavior with changes in atmosphere. Iodine
and ruthenium were both more volatile in a moist
air than in any other atmosphere studied and were
transported farther under these conditions. Iodine
passed through absolute filters but was retained
on charcoal; ruthenium was more easily filtered
in the volatile form (from moist air) than in the
less volatile form. Ruthenium was not volatile
in an atmosphere containing appreciable guantities
of steam. The release of cesium from the 1000°C
zone was lowest in experiments in which steam
was a component of the atmosphere.

Cladding material near the heated fuel is an
abundant, strongly reducing reagent and can be
expected to affect fission product behavior. Stain-
less steel appears to retain ruthenium and, under
oxidizing conditions, to lower the melting point
of UO,. Experiments with Zircaloy cladding are
in progress. Out-of-pile experiments® on the
effects of stainless steel and Zircaloy cladding
have shown that the efficiency of trapping iodine
by steam condensation is increased by the presence
of these materials.

Three experiments have been performed to study
the effect of high burnup of fuel (>20,000 Mwd/ton)
on fission product behavior. Such fuel was examined
metallographically and was found to be typical
of high-burnup fuel used in power reactors of
advanced design. Cesium and ruthenium were the
only elements affected by burnup; the fractional
release of ruthenium decreased with increasing
burnup, while that of cesium increased.

Effects of maximum temperature of the fuel are

also being investigated. In these experiments,

performed under oxidizing conditions in which the
maximum fuel temperature was maintained at ap-
proximately 2000°C, the UO, appeared to have
melted due to the formation of a low-melting eutectic
with stainless steel oxide. The releases of the
eight elements in such intermediate-temperature
experiments were similar to releases in experiments
in which complete melting occurred at approximately
2900°C. Future experiments are planned at less
than 2000°C and under reducing conditions.

The primary purpose of these in-pile experiments
is, of course, to permit prediction of behavior of
the fission products in possible reactor accidents
with reasonably assumed conditions. Accordingly,
assessment of the form and the physical and
chemical characteristics of the released materials
is an essential part of the program. Preliminary
data with a fibrous filter suggest that particles of
two size ranges are important in transport of fission
product activity. Analysis by composite diffusion
tubes shows three nonelemental iodine species in
the gas. Studies with composite diffusion tubes
have also shown that desorption of iodine from
the apparatus after a simulated accident is small;
only about 0.1% of the original inventory was

In the first experiment of a series designed
primarily to test the effect of burnup on release
and behavior of fission products, a re-irradiated
specimen of stainless-steel-clad UO, previously
irradiated to 1000 Mwd/ton was melted in the
Containment Mockup Facility (CMF).® The specimen
was melted by induction heating in a steam-air
atmosphere; the released fission products were
aged in a stainless steel tank filled with pres-
surized steam-air mixture.

differences in the distribution of fission products
reaching the tank were noted. The volatile fission
products, iodine, cesium, and tellurium, were the
only activities other than rare gases reaching the
tank in significant amounts; a large fraction of
these activities remained on the tank wall or was
collected in the condensate after 3 hr aging in the
tank with gradually decreasing pressure and
temperature.

Two different types of samplers were used to
study concentrations of gas-borne activity in the
pressurized tank during the aging period. The
two samplers gave comparable results, and the
total airborne gamma activity (mainly from iodine,
cesium, and tellurium) indicated by these samplers
agreed well with gross-activity values from a
collimated ion chamber adjacent to the side of
the tank. Figure 17.3 shows the variation with
time in concentration of the various gas-borne
activities.

Measurements were made of deposition rates
of seven fission products on four different surfaces
(stainless steel, carbon steel, aluminum, and
vinyl paint) during the experiment. Iodine showed
a significant variation in rate of deposition on
the different surfaces, but the others, with the
possible exception of a faster rate for molybdenum
on carbon steel and vinyl paint, showed no signif-
icant variations.

THE CONTAINMENT RESEARCH INSTALLATION

G. W. Parker W. J. Martin

A schematic diagram of the Containment Research
Installation (CRI) and a brief description of its
principal features were given in the previous
progress report.’ All the major components of
the CRI have been received, and construction
is approaching completion. The primary simulation
vessel, equipped with external resistance heaters
(21-kw total capacity), has been mounted in the
hot cell, and the major piping between the furnace
and the containment vessel has been installed
(see Fig. 17.4).

Installation of the containment vessel has been
delayed by a warpage problem (now solved) that
temporarily prevented insertion of one of the re-
movable liners. The liners will be painted with
either an epoxy coating that is of interest to the
LOFT facility at the NRTS or with a Bakelite
coating of the type being considered for use in the
Containment Systems Experiment at Hanford.

Stainless-steel-clad UO_ fuel specimens have
been successfully melted in the Containment Mockup
Facility using the pressurized induction furnace
arrangement that will be used in the CRI. Modifica-
tions of the furnace fittings to allow remote loading
and unloading of highly irradiated fuel are presently
being worked out. Wiring and instrumentation of
the CRI, involving instrument panels on two floor
levels, are about 75% complete.

Preliminary testing of the CRI is expected to
begin early in 1966.

ANALYSIS OF PLANS FOR SCALE-UP
IN NUCLEAR SAFETY PROGRAM

C. E. Miller, Jr. W. E. Browning, Jr.
The Nuclear Safety Program of the United States
includes firm plans for large-scale experiments —
of which the LOFT? is the most ambitious — in
which a reactor core would be destroyed and fis-
sion product release and behavior would be meas-
ured. Such experiments will be exceedingly complex
and costly and will, obviously, be few in number.
It will be essential, therefore, to gain from them
the maximum information possible and to be able —
with the help of well-designed smaller-scale
studies — to apply this information to possible
accidents under conditions other than those tested.
At the request of AEC Washington we have attempted
an evaluation of the research and development
program at ORNL and elsewhere and of the various
scaled-up experiments for which planning is firm.

11,12

As a result of this evaluation, two reports are

in the final stages of preparation.

We conclude that experiments to study fission
product behavior in containment and in gas-cleaning
systems are well scaled over the range between
small laboratory experiments and LOFT, but that
experiments to study the release and the transport
of fission products from fuels are not well scaled.
We suggest that intermediate-scale experiments of
the order of 1 and 10% of the size of LOFT are

measure fission product release from the fuel and
study fission product behavior in the primary
system following release.

We would propose for consideration four experi-
ments to bridge the gap between those described
in the previous sections of this chapter and the
LOFT assembly. These are:

A. Tests at 1% of LOFT power level:

These would be melted in place by central-

actor using a multiple-pin subassembly with
irradiated fuel pins. These would be melted
in place using nuclear heating induced by
the parent reactor.

B. Tests at 10% of LOFT power level:

[. Investigation of fission product release and
transport in the Containment Systems Exper-
iment'* primary simulator using a dummy

ity. These would be melted by nuclear
self-heating induced. by neutrons from the

Its relatively high volatility and its great bio-
logical hazard combine to make radioiodine a most
important fission product in nuclear safety con-
siderations. Elemental I, is relatively easy to
trap and hold; the great convenience and safety of
ambient-temperature activated-charcoal beds have
led to their general adoption for removing iodine
from air or gas streams.
however, that a significant fraction of the iodine
liberated in a nuclear accident might be present as
organic iodides (notably methyl iodide) which are
poorly retained by common activated charcoals
has caused concern in the field for several years.

Careful experiments have served only to con-
firm that methyl iodide is poorly retained by
standard charcoals under high humidity. Removal
of methyl iodide by Pittsburgh type PCB activated
charcoal, 12 x 30 mesh (unimpregnated for CH,I
reaction), was investigated at 24°C; gas chroma-
tography was used to determine the CH,I that
passed the bed. The inlet methyl iodide concen-
tration was varied (inversely with air velocity)
from 8 to 80 mg of CH,I per cubic meter of air to
provide a constant introduction rate. Time periods

humidity near 100%, an air velocity of 100 fpm,
and a bed depth of 1 in. to about 100 hr for a
relative humidity of less than 3%, an air velocity of
10 fpm, and a bed depth of 3 in.**® Removal of
methyl iodide and of elemental iodine by a variety
of charcoals was investigated with the air-charcoal
system at around 100°C and with the air stream
about 80% saturated with steam. In these tests
the iodine which passed the bed was determined
by radioactivity measurements. Elemental iodine
was trapped with fairly high efficiency, but methyl
iodide was not. Both radiation detection and gas
chromatography were used to test a method based
on dehumidification for improving the efficiency
of methyl iodide removal from steam-air mixtures.
This method was observed to be successful but
would require a rather complex moisture-removal
system. 8

mercial charcoal (Mine Safety Appliances Company
No. 85851) which is impregnated with several

The charcoal, as received, contains a form of

ing from the charcoal while it is trapping radio-
active CH,I. This charcoal was also found to
trap elemental iodine satisfactorily under the above
conditions.® Further tests under more severe
conditions are planned.

The investigation of the possibility of impreg-
nating charcoal with chemicals that will react
with methyl iodide to form products retained within
the charcoal bed was done mostly by gas chroma-
tography. Tests were made at 24 to 25°C with
inorganic impregnants for relative humidities around
70% and with organic impregnants for relative
humidities ranging up to 100%. As previously
observed, !® piperidine and piperazine were found
to enhance considerably the retention of methyl
iodide by charcoal so impregnated. Results ob-
tained with several materials suggested by thermo-
chemical calculations as impregnants, such as
bromine, sodium bromate, and sodium bromide,
were rather encouraging. [Further work is under

Gas chromatography has been applied to and
found to be very useful in the analysis of radio-
iodine-vapor samples. By using electron-capture
detectors, which are sensitive to organic halogen-
containing molecules, methyl iodide concentrations
of the order of 1 ppb can be measured. In the anal-
ysis of vapor from radioactive-iodine sources, a
number of unidentified peaks were often observed.
Since some of these peaks may have been due to
small amounts of extraneous impurities, such as
chloroform and fluorocarbons, and since there is con-
siderable variation in sensitivity between dif-
ferent compounds of iodine, there is need, on
for detection that is more specific.

refrigerated condensers to remove moisture have
been only partially successful.’® Of several
desiccants which have been tested for drying the
air, Drierite (anhydrous calcium sulfate) appears
to be promising because of its minimal adsorption
of methyl iodide.!” An improved deposition pat-
tem for methyl iodide also has been obtained
under moist conditions by substitution of an iodine-
impregnated charcoal for the normal coconut-
charcoal lining of the diffusion tube.’

Investigation of iodine behavior in May packs
under various conditions was continued. A test
of a volatile iodine sample in a May pack of the
type used in the Nuclear Safety Pilot Plant was
made with an air-steam atmosphere at 100°C, 2 atm
absolute pressure, and 90% relative humidity.!®
In general, the behavior was similar to that of
composite diffusion tubes at the same conditions,
but before more precise comparisons can be made,
further experimentation will be ‘required. A facility
for studying the behavior of normal and modified
May packs in moist atmospheres at elevated tem~
peratures is being constructed.

Gas chromatography with dual detection (electron
capture and radiation) has been successfully ap-
plied in the analysis of various radicactive-iodine
and methyl iodide sources in the laboratory.'®

A comparison of the deposition of various iodine-
vapor species in a composite diffusion tube of a
design for use in in-pile experiments ‘with the
deposition in the more usual type of composite
diffusion tube was made.?’ Similarities and dif-
ferences were observed; however, with the aid of
this information a useful interpretation of the in-
pile data can be made. In conjunction with this
study, the reactivity of iodine vapor with Dacron
fiber was observed, Deposition on the fiber, which
is used in a fibrous-filter characterization device
for aerosols, was greater than 90% for elemental
iodine and negligible for the nonelemental species.

Application of the fibrous-filter analyzer, devel-
oped previously for study of filtration processes,?!
as an analytical sampler for particulate material
in moist atmospheres is being evaluated.?? Two
problems are currently under study: (1) the physi-
cal response of the analyzer to an aerosol under
conditions of high humidity and (2) the production
of a radioactive, monodisperse aerosol of known
size with which to calibrate the response of the
analyzer under various combinations of operating
parameters. At low sampling velocities of 3 to
11 fpm, the fibrous-filter analyzer shows promise
as an analytical sampler in a wet atmosphere. The
fiber configuration and filtration processes are
not significantly affected by the moisture. A
satisfactory monodisperse aerosol of known size
has been prepared from a Dow polystyrene latex
solution; however, efforts to tag it radiochemically
have not yet been successful,

Laboratory investigations of the filtration of
particulate aerosols which simulate those expected
to be generated during reactor accidents are con-
tinuing. The technique for the generation and
characterization of the test aerosol has been re-
ported previously, ?*

Results of tests in a dry-air (<3% relative
humidity) system indicate that the arc-generated
aerosol consists of two particulate size groups,
each of which has different tendencies to pene-
trate a commercial (Flanders 700) high-efficiency
filter medium.?® The less penetrating group is
trapped with an efficiency of >99.99% on the

Flanders filter, while the more penetrating group
is trapped at a slightly lower efficiency of > 99.9%.
Current using aerosols generated
from UO, clad with either neutron~-irradiated stain-
less steel or Zitcaloy have produced results similar
to the earlier studies. Similar values were ob-
tained when air velocity ranged from 3.2 to 13 fpm

experiments

and when dry helium or argon was substituted for
the air atmosphere.

However, in a recent series of experiments ?®
in which the relative humidity of the air sweep
ranged from approximately 46 to 100%, the filter
efficiency was noted to drop to as low as 93%.
Fibrous-filter deposition profiles and photomicro-
graphs of an aerosol produced in a 46% relative
humidity experiment indicate that the filtration
characteristics of the particles of the aerosol are
changed. Future experiments will attempt to de-
termine the role which water vapor plays in this
observed reduction in filter efficiency.

IGNITION OF CHARCOAL ADSORBERS BY

iodine are subject to heating by decay of iodine
adsorbed on the charcoal. The heat generated in
pieces of charcoal containing the greatest amount
of adsorbed iodine may raise their temperature to
the ignition point. In order to simulate such an
event, an in-pile experiment that utilizes the fuel-
melting facility in the Oak Ridge Research Re-
actor has been designed. In this experiment the
decay of short-lived iodine adsorbed on the char~
coal generates heat. The objective of this ex-
periment is to measure and compare the ignition
temperature of the charcoal with and without fis-
sion product adsorption. A comparison of the cal-
culated decay-heat load on the {front surface of the
charcoal in the experimental adsorber with those
of adsorbers at various reactors indicates that
the ignition effects in the reactor adsorbers will
be smaller than those in the experiment.

After the mechanical design and plans for operat-
ing the experiments were shown to be adequate
by tests in a laboratory mockup, ?’ an initial series
of in-pile experiments was performed.?® In these
experiments the ignition temperature was studied
as a function of both the air flow and the decay-
heat loading. Preliminary results of these studies
indicate that the charcoal igpition temperature is
not greatly affected by the decay heat of adsorbed
fission products.
