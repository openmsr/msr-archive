MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRAM QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

SUMMARY

Part 1. Reactor Design Studies

 

1.1 Nuclear Calculations and Design Studies

 

The nuclear performance of a two-region graphite-moderated molten-
salt breeder reactor was studied. The cylindrical core was approximated
by a 5-ft sphere for the purposes of calculation; the reactor power was
125 Mw(th), 53 Mw(e); the fuel end blanket salts were each processed at
the rate of 10 ft3/day; and the total fuel volume was 41.3 £t3. The op-
timum case was found to have an initial inventory of 42 kg of U233 and a
doubling time ranging from 10 to 26 years, according to the degree of
pessimism with which the values of n for U232 in the near epithermal

range were selected.

1.2 Component Development and Testing

Salt-lubricated hydrodynamic journal bearings with two axial grooves
180° apart were tested to failure. The first of these bearings seized
after 33 hr and 22 start-stops, running at 1200 rpm and 200 1b, loading.
Examination and analysis of these bearings after test indicate they do not
have dynamic stability equal - to previously tested bearings having three
equally spaced grooves,

Three further tests were conducted with bearings containing three
equally spaced helical" grooves. These tests were terminated because of
impending failure as the load was increased. Analysis indicated that end

leakage from the helical grooves interfered with the inward flow of liquid

required to maintain a hydrodynamic: film and suggested that flow restrictors
at the ends of ‘the grooves ‘might remedy the condition. A test incorporating
a flow restriction showed this to improve the load-carrying capacity of the
bearing. by a factor of 3.

Fabrication of a pump | incorporating a three-axial-groove hydrodynamic
bearing was completed. This pump is being assembled and checked prior to :
operation with molten salt.

The modified Fulton-Sylphon bellows seal operating in a PK type of
centrifugal pump has accumulated 14,830 hr, The MF type centrifugal pump
has continued to operate and has logged 17,664 hr (more than two years)
of continuous operation.

The small frozen-lead-seal pump operating with 1200°F molten salt has
logged 9400 hr of continuous, maintenance-free operation. |

Construction of the Remote Maintenance Demonstration Facility was.
completed on schedule. This facility incorporates a one-third-scale mockup
of a typical molten-salt reactor together with remote manipulators and re-
mote viewing equipment. The system is in the process of being checked out
prior to operation with molten salt; then the subsequent disassembly and
reassembly by use of remote maintenance techniques will be conducted. The
objective is to uncover and find solutions to the problems of remotely
maintaining a reactor system after it has operated at power.

One long-term corrosion test loop was terminated after a year's opera~
tion, leaving 1k test loops in operation. Eleven of these are constructed

of INOR-8 and three of Inconel. The terminated loop contained specimens

‘of graphite in contact with the hottest salt in order to determine the com-

patibility of unclad graphite with the salt. Examination is not yet com-
pleted.
The second in-pile loop test was terminated because of pump seizure

after approximately 1000 hr operation.

1.3 Engineering Research
The enthalpy and viscosity of a high-thorium-content blanket salt mix-

 

ture have been experimentally determined. The viscosity was observed to
decrease somewhat more rapidly with temperature than do the viscosities of

a number of other mixtures with high percentages of ThF, or UF,. Over the

temperature range investigated, the viscosities of the several mixtures

were the same to within 10%. . Preliminary measurements of the enthalpy of
this blanket salt indicate a heat capacity consistent with the value pre-
dicted by a correlation based on experimental measurements with other mix-
tures containing various amounts of NaF, LiF, BeFp, UF, and ThF,. A re-

determination of the viscosities of two low-UFs-content mixtures with the

modified viscometer resulted in lower values and altered temperature de-
pendence for both salts. Assembly of the system for the study of inter-
facial film formation and heat transfer with BeFs~containing salts is con-

tinuing. Two schemes for heating the test sections are being considered.

1.4 Instruments and Controls

 

The Q-1717-54 level probe tested previously was examined metallurgi-
cally and found to be in excellent condition. A new series of tests was
started with two level elements made of Inconel being tested in fuel 130
at 1200°F. The spans of both probes have decreased throughout the tests,

probably because of an increase in resistivity of the fuel.

Part 2, Materials Studies

2.1 Metallurgy
Examinations of eleven INOR-8 thermal-convection loops, which had

operated with fused fluoride mixtures, were completed; nine of the loops
had operated for one year, and each of the other two had operated for 1000
hr. Only one of the loops experienced more than a very light attack, in
the form of surface pitting or shallow surface roughening in hot-leg sec-
tions. Twelve Inconel loops were examined; nine had operated for one year
and three for 1000 hr, All except one showed attack in the form of inter-
granular voids to a depth ranging from 1 to 18 mils. An INOR-8 pump-loop
test to determine the compatability of INOR-8, graphite, and a fluoride
fuel was terminated after one- year. The loop wall showed light surface

 Toughening and pitting to’ less than i mil; there was no evidence of car-

burization; the fuel salt: ‘shoved. the expected chromium pickup but was un-

dmtad by impurities in. ‘the graphite.

“A 6000-hr test and a: 5000- -hr test of INOR-8 exposed at 1300° F to a

syste containing graphite and fuel 130 have been completed, and no evi-
dence of carburization vas observed in. the TNOR-8 by metallographic,

mechanical, ‘and chemical exeminations. Inconel and INOR-8 specimens ex-
posed.” to graphite- sodium systems for L000 hr at 1LOO°F were carburized to
a depth of 30 to 40 mils and showed a loss in ductility both at room tem-
perature and at 1250°F. |

 
 

 

vi

Fuel 30 (NaF-ZrF4-UF4, 50-46-L mole %) and fuel 130 (LiF-BeFo-UFy,
62-37-1 mole %) penetrated to 58% or more of the accessible void volume
in AGOT graphite specimens when 150 psig pressure was applied in a 100-hr
exposure at 1300°F (704°C).

Initial gettering and flushing tests to remove oxide contaminants
from graphite specimens with fuel 130 in a 20-hr exposure at 1300°F
(704°C) appeared to reduce the amount of uranium oxide precipitation
normally observed in tests with nongettered graphite.

| The program for evaluating the mechanical properties of INOR-8 has
been reviewed, and the significant results obtained from this program are
summarized with respect to the variations observed in testing various heats
of material. It has been found that two heats, SP-16 and SP-19, exhibit
very similar mechanical properties, while two high-carbon heats, 8 M-1 and
1327, are stronger in tensile tests but have creep properties similar to
those of SP-16 and SP-19.

Initial studies to determine the claddability of prefabricated porous
nickel for use as a leak-detecting component in a triplex heat exchanger
tube have indicated that the material can be bonded to Inconel with reten-
tion of core porosity. An attempt has been made to fabricate a 9-ft
triplex tube by utilizing six 18-in. lengths of prefabricated porous
nickel tubing as the core, Although evaluation of this tube is incomplete,
radiographic inspection revealed slight separations between two of the
five core-to-core joints. It has not yet been determined at which step
during fabrication these flaws developed.

An INOR-8 weld-metal composition containing 2% niobium has exhibited
good ductility at 1500°F. A large heat of this composition is being pre-
pared for further inert-arc studies and for metallic-arc studies. The
ductility at 1500°F is quite sensitive to small variations in weld-metal

chemistry, and careful chemical control should be observed.

2.2 Chemistry and Radiation Effects
Solid-solution formation, resulting from the interchangeability of
ThF, and UF,, plays an important role in the freezing behavior of breeder

fuels, as demonstrated in the NaF-ThF,-UF, phase diagram. The existence

vil

of a quasi-binary system between NaF.BeF- and ThF, furnishes important
clues to some of the controlling phase relationships in the NaF-BeFo-ThF,
ternary system. |

Groundwork for a phase study of PuFs fuels is provided by cooling
curves on a series of compositions from the NaF-PuFs binary system. Freez-
ing-point depressions for NaF, as influenced by the size and charge of
solute cation, are being measured as an aid to theoretical interpretation
of molten-fluoride behavior,

Solubility measurements for Xe and COs yield information of both
theoretical and applied interest; the temperature coefficient for CO»
changes sign.

Fission-product behavior, particularly as related to fuel reprocessing
and recovery, has been studied in experiments on the solubility and pre-
cipitation of rare-earth fluorides. Also, some additional investigations
of the reactions of UF, with oxides are of interest in connection with re-
processing and with exposure to oxide contamination during maintenance.
Preliminary indications are that higher ThF, concentrations in breeder
fuels diminish or perhaps eliminate the oxide sensitivity exhibited by
LiF-BeFo-UF4 melts,

Solubility measurements on NiFp, throw new light on the thermodynamic
behavior of this corrosion product, but do not resolve the mystery of why
the apparent activity coefficient of NiFz in fuels is so high.

Practical aspects of corrosion behavior have been followed with
periodic sampling of corrosion-test loops, while systematic approaches
to’ related problems have been advanced with the aid of varied techniques
such as. vepor-pressure studies and radioactive tracers.

In a ‘study of the compatibility of graphite with fuel, no deleterious
or unfavorable effects were encountered with samples of an impervious

graphite which were exposed to circulating fuel for one year in a corrosion-

test loop, Other. experiments with graphite, giving seemingly diverse and

erratic results, can ‘probebly be correlated by taking into account the
effects of oxide and of the’ pressure required for forcing a nonwetting

liquid into the particular pore spectrum of a graphite sample.

Work on the preparation of purified materials proceeded at an accel-
erated pace,

A thermal-~convection loop was assembled and loaded for in-pile opera-
tion. Two test assemblies of the capsule variety, containing fissioning

fuel in INOR-8, have operated in the MIR for three months.

2.3 Fuel Processing

Two modifications of the HF dissolution process for purifying the
LiF-BeFs carrier salt are being investigated. One concerns the dissolu-
tion of uranium along with the LiF and part of the BeFp, which are soluble
in anhydrous HF. Addition of ClF5; to HF oxidizes UF, to UFg, which has
appreciable solubility in anhydrous HF. Dissolution of uranium and LiF
together would permit recovery of all the valuable isotopically enriched
material in a single step, which would result in considerable saving in
equipment and operation, since the volatility step for uranium recovery
from the fuel would be unnecessary. The other modification involves de-
contamination of LiF from fission products that are soluble in HF, such
as cesium, and therefore are not separated in the initial dissolution.
Partial evaporation of a 90% HF solution of fuel salt yields a precipitate
containing nearly all the lithium and a solution containing most of the

cesium,

1.1 NUCLEAR CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STUDIES

Nuclear Performance of a Two-Region Graphite-Modersted
Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor

A typical conceptual arrangement is shown in Fig. 1.1.1. The main
part of the core is fabricated from a single cylinder of graphite about
5 ft in diameter and 5 ft long. The end pieces are also prepared by
machining solid pieces, and the three sections are held together by means
of rods of INOR-8 or other suitable alloy. The fuel salt passes through
the core and is circulated to an external heat exchanger. The blanket
salt surrounding the core is maintained at a slightly higher pressure, and
contains the fluorides of lithium, beryllium, and thorium in the same pro-
portions as in the fuel salt. A proposed processing scheme is shown dia-
grammatically in Fig. 1.1.2. In this scheme, fuel salt is withdrawn from
the fuel circuit and passed through a tower whére it is exposed to fluorine
gas (the fluoride volatility process). Uranium is removed in the gas
stream as the hexafluoride. The barren effluent salt, containing the
nonvolatile fission products and Pa233, is sent to the blanket salt cir-
cuit, where it is diluted wy a factor of approximately 10. The blanket
salt is treated with CeF3 to remove rare-earth fission products. A side
stream from the blanket salt circuit is also treated with fluorine to re-
cover the 23s bred therein. This, together with the uranium recovered
from the fuel salt, is combined with blanket salt that has been treated
with CeFs to reconstitute fuel salt.

By this scheme, rare-earth. fission, products are removed from the

system, and other fission products {alkali metals, alkaline earths) and
Pa? are substantially diluted. Further, any leakage of blanket fluid

into the fuel circuit can Te compensated conveniently by increasing the

rate of processing of the fuel stream with fluorine, since this operation

returns barren sdlt to the blanket system,

In a previous study, the fuel channels through the graphite core vere

2.66 in. in diameter and were arranged in an 8-in. triangular lattice.®

The estimate of the performance was based on the assumption that the
molten salt fuel would penetrate the solid graphite to a negligible ex-
tent. In the present study, the consequences of fuel penetration were
~ considered.

Optimally, the fuel salt occupies about 10% of the core volume, If
1 vol % of the graphite should be penetrated by the fuel, approximately
10% of the fuel in the core would be incorporated into the graphite.

Since the thermal neutron flux in the moderator is greater than in the
fuel channels, somewhat more than 10% of the total fission heat would be
released in the graphite, with the result that thermal stresses in excess
of the maximum allowable (1000 psi) might be set up. Figure 1.1.3 shows
values of the estimated temperature rise in the graphite for a fuel pene-
tration of 1 vol %, a fuel-channel volume of 10%, various fuel-channel
radii, and various assumed heat release rates in the moderator. It was
estimated that a temperature rise of LOO°F in the graphite could be toler-
ated, and it is seen that the fuel-channel radius may not exceed 1/2 in.
for a heat release rate of 15 Mw, which corresponds to a reactor pover of
125 Mw. The corresponding lattice spacing is 3.0 in.

The nuclear performance of the reactor in equivalent spherical
geometry was then studied by means of the multigroup Oracle programs
Cornpone and Sorghum. Because of the smallness of the lattice parameters,
the core was assumed, for the purposes of nuclear calculation, to consist
of a homogeneous mixture of fuel salt and graphite. The basic core salt
was 65 mole % LiF, 31 mole % BeFp, and 4 mole % ThF4. A core equivalent
to a 5-ft sphere was selected for study, and a blanket 30 in, thick was
specified. Although the processing scheme requires that the fuel and
blanket salts have the same thorium concentration, the calculations were
performed throughout using 13 mole % thorium in the blanket. The neutron
leakage from the blanket can be matched at lower thorium concentrations
by using a thicker blanket, but parasitic absorptions in lithium, beryllium,
and fluorine in the blanket are somewhat underestimated at the higher con-
centration. The error, however, is small. No correction for fuel inlet

and outlet manifolds was made. The total reactor heat rate was set at

125 Mw(th), with a plant factor of 0.8. It was estimated that the various
components of the external heat-removal circuit would entail the volumes VY

of fuel listed in Table 1.1.1.

The power density in the external circuit is thus about 4 Mw/£t3, which
is moderately high performance but not so high as specified for certain ¥
other molten-salt systems (e.g., the ART). The volume of fuel in the
core is 8.2 ft3, bringing the total to 42.7 £3.

In the Sorghum program, provision is made for the treatment of the
processing of only a single group of fission products. Accordingly, the
performance of the scheme was assumed to be approximated by the complete
removal of the fission products from the fuel-salt processing stream; the
return of Pa®33 and fission products in the fuel-salt makeup stream was
neglected, as was also the absorption of neutrons by fission products and
Pa®33 in the blanket. Fluoride volatility processing rates for fuel and
blanket systems were set at 10 ft3/day each, which resulted in processing
cycles of 4 and 40 days, respectively.

The effect of varying the thorium concentration in the fuel salt is

ow

illustrated in Fig. 1.1.4 for a core having a fuel volume fraction of 0.10.
It is seen that the doubling time reaches a rather broad minimum, near 13 v
years, between 1 and Lt mole % ThF,. Judging from the curves, the optimum O

thorium fluoride concentration is about 2.5 mole %. The corresponding

initial inventory is about 37 kg of U2®3, and the specific power (average)
is about 2.7 Mw/kg.

However, parasitic losses to lithium, beryllium, and fluorine and
leakage from the blanket become excessive when the thorium is too dilute.
A salt having 4 mole % ThF, was selected as a reasonable compromise.

The effect of varying fuel volume fraction at constant thorium con-
centration is shown in Fig. 1.1.5. The lower curve is based on initial
conditions (i.e., initial breeding ratio obtained in the clean core) and
was computed by using the approximate equation

1.05 n X inventory (kg of U=33)

doubling time (years) = {breeding ratio - 1) x reactor heat (Mw)

The upper curve was based on Sorghum lifetime calculations covering periods
up to 20 years of operation. It is seen that estimates based on initial
conditions are grossly misleading. Not only are the doubling times about
half those computed in the lifetime studies, but the trend is downward
with increasing volume fraction of the fuel in the core; whereas, when
the accumulation of fission fragments and uranium isotopes is taken into
account, the doubling time is a minimum when the volume fraction is about
0.125.

An extract from the predicted performance of the optimum core is
given in Table 1.1.2,where inventories, neutron balances, etc., for the
initial state and after 20 years are given. It is seen that the initial
inventory of U233 is about 42 kg, giving an average specific power of
about 2.5 Mw/kg. Over a period of 20 years, the increase in inventory
required to override fission product poisons and uranium isotopes amounts
to 18 kg. Also, in that period the excess production amounts to 78 kg of
U233, giving, in terms of the initial inventory, an average doubling time
of 11 years.

This doubling time was calculated by using energy-dependent values
of 7 for U3 compiled by J. T. Roberts® of the Molten Salt Group in

the initial inventory, for the first time, is 12, 11, and 33 years, re-
spectively. Later, after the fission product concentration has stabilized,
the excess production rate is higher, Doubling times based on this higher,
"stable" rate are 10, 9, and 25 years, respectively.

It is clear that the estimated performance is sensitive to the
assumed values of n for U233, However, it seems probable that doubling
times of 25 years or less can be achieved in externally cooled molten-

salt reactors.

1.2 COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING

Molten-Salt-~Lubricated Bearings for Fuel Pumps

Hydrodynamic Journal Bearings

 

operating conditions of 200 1b

Investigations on journal bearings made of INOR-8 were continued
throughout the quarter. Five tests were conducted in molten salt 130
(LiF-BeFo-UF,, 62-37-1 mole %), in which two types of bearing-groove con-
figurations were investigated for application to a vertical-shaft centri-
fugal fuel pump. Previous tests had been made with bearings having three
equally spaced axial grooves. These bearings could carry acceptable radial
loads in each of three known directions 120° apart, but their load-carrying
ability was sharply reduced at other radial load angles. It was therefore
decided to test bearings having two axial grooves 180° apart, as shown in
Fig. 1.2.1, since this configuration should be capable of accepting reason-
able loads over a wider range of angles.

Tests 10 and 11 were conducted with a bearing containing two axial
grooves. The same bearing and journal were used in each test except that
the radial clearance measured at room temperature was increased from 0.005
in. for test 10 to 0,007 in. for test 11.

In test 10, the bearing was inadvertently operated for 5 hr without
load (at speeds up to 1800 rpm), and subsequently was operated for 33 hr

with a 200-1b_, load at 1200 rpm, during which time 22 start-stops were

f
made. Termination resulted from seizure of the bearing. Postrun examina-
tion of the test surfaces revealed a wear pattern that would be representa-
tive of either vibration or film whirl, Test 11 covered a period of 6 hr,

of which 2 1/2 hr was devoted to performance at various combinations of

speed and. load, and: the remaining 3 1/2. hr vas devoted to steady-state

£ and 1200 rpm, This test was also term-

inated" as a result of seizure. The results of postrun examination were

similar to those in test 10. The test bearing configuration with two

axial grooves apparently does not have adequate dynamic stability.
Three further tests were conducted with bearings containing three

equally spaced helical grooves as shown in Fig. 1.2.2. All the tests were

conducted at 1200°F and 1200 rpm, and the radial clearance in each test

was 0.005 in., measured at room temperature. The groove cross-sectional
dimensions were the same as those used with previous tests of axial grooves.
In test 12, the load vas applied in a direction such that the minimum film
section should have crossed a groove at or near the mid-point of the bear-

£ to 175
1b, for 26 hr. The test was terminated as a result of impending seizure

ing length. The bearing was subjected to various loads from 10 1b

f
when the load was increased from 150 1b, to 175 1b. Just prior to the
impending seizure, the test had operated for 2 hr at 150 1b_. Postrun

f
examination of the bearing surfaces revealed considerable wear near the

lower end and very slight wear near the upper end.

Test 13 was conducted with the bearing and journal used in test 12

but with the surfaces cleaned up with hand tools, resulting in little or
no change in the original 0.005-in. room-temperature clearance. The load
was applied to the opposite side of the bearing from that in test 12.
With this direction of loading, the minimum film section should have
crossed the ends of two separate grooves located at opposite ends of the
bearing. The test consisted in operation at various loads from 10 1b, to
150 1b... The test was operated for 2 hr at 150 1b, load and was then
stopped to investigate start-and-stop ability. Upon restarting, the bear-
ing began to show evidence of impending seizure and was thus terminated.
The total operating time was 23 hr. Postrun examination revealed that the
fallure was quite similar to that in test 12.

The bearings having helical grooves, that were used in tests 12 and

13 had inferior load-carrying capacity compared with bearings having three

axial grooves. An analysis ‘pointed ‘out the possibility that the end leak-

age through the helical grooves ‘interfered with the flow of liquid required

by the bearing. hydrodynamic film. It was suggested that the eddition of
a flow restriction on the. leakage end. of the grooves would remedy the

dita

In test. 1h, a restriction to flow at’ the discharge end of the grooves,
consisting of a thin’ disk ‘having an ‘inside diameter 0.010 in. larger than
the inside diameter of the bearing, was installed. Operation of this bear-

ing covered a period of 215 hr, and loads up to 500 1b, were applied to

 
 

 

18 | . ed

the bearing. During the period of operation, 260 start-stop operations
were satisfactorily performed, and the test was terminated on schedule.
Visual inspection of the surfaces showed signs of slight wear. Restricting
the flow of molten salt lubricant from the grooves had the effect of trip-
ling the load-carrying capacity of the bearing having three helical grooves
at identical operating condition. This type of bearing should be able to
accept loads in any radial direction.
Further tests will be conducted in the next quarter with carburized
INOR-8 journals operating in noncarburized INOR-8 bearings at temperatures
above 1200°F. These investigations will be made in order to test the im-
provement in start-stop ability of carburized journals compared with non-
carburized journals. Other tests are planned for bearings having three
helical grooves but with smaller groove cross sections than were used in

the bearings reported above,

Hydrodynamic Thrust Bearings

Assembly of the thrust bearing tester was completed, and one test
was performed with fuel 134 [62 LiF, 36.5 BeFz, 1.0 ThF, 0.5 UF, (mole
%)] at 1200°F. The runner was rotated at speeds up to 1400 rpm, and
the load applied to the thrust plate was varied from 0 to 250 1b. There
was no evidence during the test, which operated for 30 min, that a hydro-
dynamic film was developed. Postrun examination of the surfaces revealed
evidence of gross metal~to-metal rubbing. The surfaces of the rotor and
stator thrust plates may have distorted sufficiently at elevated tempera-
ture, or the stator plate may have vibrated enough to prevent the estab-
lishment of a hydrodynamic film, Bench tests with oil as the lubricant
are planned during the next quarter prior to further tests with molten

salt in order to establish a base point of bearing operation.

Test of Pump Equipped with One Molten-Salt-Lubricated Journal Bearing
The detailed design work was completed on the pump, and the fabrica-

tion of parts is essentially complete, Assembly and checking of the pump

are under way. Bench tests are planned for the operation of the upper

ball bearing and the lower journal bearing in oil prior to pump operation <

for the initial molten-salt operation of the pump.
The pump test stand was completed,

Bearing Mountings

A tester for investigating at room temperature the stiffness produced
by various methods of mounting bearing shells to pump containers was de-
signed and fabricated. Preliminary testing has begun, using diaphragms

of various thicknesses.

Self-Welding of INOR-8

Parts have been fabricated to investigate the self-welding of INOR-8
against INOR-8 immersed in molten salt. The experiments will be conducted
during the next quarter in the stress-rupture test facility at the Metal-

Jurgy Division.

Mechanical Seals for Pumps
The modified Fulton-Sylphon bellows-mounted seal, undergoing en-

 

durance test in a PKP type of centrifugal punp, has accumulated an addi-
tional 2350 hr of operation since the previous report period, for a

total of 14,830 hr, The pump continues to operate at constant conditions
of 1200°F Joop temperature, a shaft speed of 2500 rpm, and a NaK flow rate
of 1200 gpm. The seal leakage in both the test seal and the Durametallic
upper seal has been negligible. ‘No pump stoppages occurred since the last

salt 30 at 1200°F. During the quarter the pump was stopped three times.
One stop was momentary and due to a power outage, one stop was of 5 min
duration to replace filters in the motor-generator set, and the other was

of 10 min duration to replace the brushes in the d-c drive motor.

Remote Maintenance Demonstration Facility

This facility has been constructed in Building 9201-3 in the 1-12
area to study remote maintenance problems and to demonstrate the feasi-
bility of devices and techniques for remote maintenance of a molten-salt
reactor system. It incorporates, to approximately 1/3 scale, a mockup of
a typical reactor system in its essential parts, and a complement of re-
mote manipulating and viewing equipment. Molten salt will be circulated
through the system at prototype temperature and pressure. It is proposed
to demonstrate that any component can be removed and replaced and the
original integrity of the system re-established.

Main components of the facility consist of the following:

1. Reactor. — A dummy reactor functions as a support for the pump
and serves to represent the space layout problems associated with the
actual reactor. The dummy is made of steel framing and is covered with
insulation to form the desired reactor contour (Fig. 1.2.3).

2. Reactor Circuit. — The reactor circuit is intended to represent
the space layout and maintenance problems associated with several symmetri-
cally arranged heat exchanger circuits which might be incorporated in a
typical molten-salt reactor. The circuit includes a standard PK pump to
circulate molten salt (1200°F) through the dummy reactor (Fig. 1.2.4),
two dummy heat exchangers (Fig. 1.2.5), and two dummy secondary systems
(Fig. 1.2.6). The heat exchanger and reactor connections have freeze-
flange mechanical joints. The fill and drain system has been designed
to transfer approximately 120 gal of fuel 30 by means of pressurized gas
from the sump tank to the reactor circuit. The reactor circuit will be
filled with hot fuel, and the fuel will be circulated for a short time
before being dumped. The mechanical joints will be broken, a component
removed and replaced, and the joint remade to meet the required leak-~

tightness specifications,

Piping is 6-1in.-IPS Inconel for the main header circuits and 3-1/2-
in,~IPS Inconel for the secondary circuits. The reactor circuit piping

is supported on specially designed adjustable spring hangers (Fig. 1.2.7)

~ that permit all piping to expand or contract during operation without

overstressing the pipe. All piping can be removed from above, Reactor
piping connecting heat exchangers, sump tank, and reactor is connected

by freeze flanges (Fig. 1.2.7) that permit remote disassembly by the manip-
ulator. All reactor piping is preheated by standard clamshell and Calrod
electric heaters, with the exception of one section which is preheated by
a specially designed clamshell unit (Fig. 1.2.8) containing electric
heaters and thermal insulation in one package. The units are removable
and replaceable in short sections by the manipulator. Thermocouple and
electric heater discomnects (Figs. 1.2.9 and 1.2.10) have been specially
designed to permit remote handling by the manipulator.

3, Manipulator. — A General Mills model 300 manipulator has been
specially modified for use in this facility. This mechanical arm has a
vertical travel of 20 ft and operates on a railway 4o ft long with a 20-ft
span. In addition to the manipulator, a remotely operated overhead crane
is available with 5-ton- and 20-ton-capacity hoists. The manipulator will
be used for making and breaking connections, carrying light loads up to
750 1b, and aiding the overhead crane in positioning heavy components.

bo ‘Remote Vieving Equipment. - Closed~-circuit stereotelevision is

 

used for all remote. viewing. Two. sets ‘of General Precision remotely op-

erated stereotelevision systems. ‘are being installed. One set, with a

‘three-lens turret, will. be: on a remotely operated dolly that is located
on the edge of the control’ room. roof. The ‘second stereotelevision set

The design, procurement, and construction of this facility were
essentially complete by the scheduled completion date of July 1, 1959,
with the exception of the installation of the two closed-circuit stereo-

television sets.

Frozen-Lead Pump Seal
The small frozen-lead pump seal being tested on a 3/16-in.-dia

 

shaft, as described previously,Z has operated continuously with no leak-
age since the start of its operation on June 13, 1958. The accumulated
operating time as of July 10, 1959, was 9L0O hr.

The large lead pump seal with a 3-1/b4-in.-dia rotating shaft has
been operating for 5400 hr, since November 12, 1958. Leakage of solid
lead from the seal is sporadic. The lead leakage would probably be elim-
inated by a seal which would provide better coolant control and would in-
corporate a resilient packing to decrease the annulus between the seal,
and shaft. A detailed description of the equipment was presented pre-
viously.2

Information was obtained on a new material called "Zirklor," a com-
pound of zirconium and chlorine, which has potential use for high-tem-
perature bearings and seals because of its self-lubricating and elastic
properties. Tests made on finely powdered samples showed Zirklor to be
subject to severe oxidation in air at 500°C. Apparently it will be neces-
sary to protect the Zirklor with a coating if it is used in air, or to

provide an inert atmosphere, especially for elevated temperatures.

Mechanical Joints for the Reactor System

 

Three sets of disk springs have been ordered, one set for each of
the three sizes of freeze-flange joints in the Remote Maintenance Facility.
These springs should prevent or reduce gas leakage, which may occur vhen

the flange joints are thermal-cycled.

Design, Construction, and Operation of Materijals-Testing Loops

Forced-Circulation Corrosion Loops

 

The operation of long-term forced-circulation corrosion-testing loops
was continued. Table 1,2.1 gives a summary of operations for the period,
with the total hours of operation at test conditions. Fourteen loops are
in operation at the time of this report, consisting of eleven made of
INOR-8 and three of Inconel.

One test loop, designated 9354-5,4 was terminated during this period
after a year of operation at test conditions. The loop, shown in Fig.
2.1.5, contained graphite samples in the hot fluid stream. The loop,
container, and graphite have been dissected. The results of the examina-
tion will be reported, when completed, by the metallurgy and chemistry
sections.

One test loop, designated MSRP-13 in the operations summary, began
operation during this period. This loop is fabricated of INOR-8 and is
operating with salt 136 (LiF-BeFo-UF, 70-10-20 mole %).

Normal operation was experienced by all but two tests during this
period. Test loop 9377-5 was temporarily drained of molten salt April L
1959, after it experienced a complete failure of the pump motor. It was
refilled and resumed operation following replacement of the motor.

Test loop 9377-6 experienced a failure of an electronic power-con-
trol unit and became plugged ‘before auxiliary heat sources could respond,
a result of the high freezing temperature of the salt circulated. During

normal operation of this loop there is only a 30°F difference between the
freezing temperature of 990° F and the lowest wall temperature ~ecorded on

the loop.

Tn-Pile Loops

The second MSRP in-pile loop test operating in the MIR was terminated
when ‘the pump seized after approximately ‘1000 hr of operation. Pump opera-~

be established until the loop is examined, but accumulated products of
radiation-damaged lubricating oil probably interfered with the rotating
members, as in previous in-pile pumps. Loop operation was satisfactory
in other respects,

The average loop heat generation for 766 hr with the reactor at
power was 7.71 kw (57 w/cm®), based on total fuel inventory of the loop.
The average loop maximum temperature during power operation was 1325°F.
Measured loop temperature difference averaged 125°F, giving a total effec-
tive loop temperature difference of 217°F when the calculated heat ex-
changer salt film temperature drop is included.

The loop is scheduled to be cut from the shield plug at the MIR dur-
ing July for return to ORNL for detailed examination.

The chemical and metallographic examinations of the fuel and con-~

tainer materials of the first loop are in progress.

1.3 ENGINEERING RESEARCH

Physical-Property Measurements

Viscosity

The viscosity of a high~thorium-content blanket salt mixture, termed
BeLT-15 and having the composition LiF-BeFo-ThF, (67-18-15 mole %), has
been determined by using the "skirted" capillary efflux viscometer.
the temperature range from 510 to 800°C, the results are described by the

Over

equation
b= 0.031 £5308/T

where nu is the viscosity in centipoises and T is the temperature (°K).
The data are compared in Fig. 1.3.1 with previous measurements® on salt
mixtures 133 (LiF-BeFp-ThF,, 71-16-13 mole %), 134 (LiF-BeFo-ThF4~UF,,
62-3%6.5-1-0.5 mole %), and 136 (LiF~-BeFo-UF,, 70-10-20 mole %). The
viscosity of the BeLT-15 mixture decreases somewhat more sharply with
temperature than do the viscosities of the comparison salts. To estab-
lish the effect of thorium content on the viscosities of BelT compositions,
it is planned to study a number of additional ThF,-containing mixtures.
The modified (skirted) efflux viscometers were used to redetermine
the viscosities of mixtures 123 (NaF-BeFo-UFy, 53-46-1 mole %) and 126
(LiF-BeFo-UF,, 53-46-1 mole %).2 The current data are compared with the
earlier measurements in Fig. 1.3.2; also shown are the results with com-
position 130 (LiF-BeFo-UF,, 62-37-1 mole %). It is to be noted that the
new data indicate lower viscosities for both mixtures. With salt 126
the difference between the two sets of data increases with increasing
temperature, while with composition 123 this difference decreases with

temperature. Between the temperatures of 500 and 900°C the viscosities

Enthalpy and Heat Capacity
It has been the practice to report the results of experimentally de-
termined enthalpy-temperature relations for fused salt mixtures in the

form of a three-constant least-squares-evaluated equation,

= 2
Hp, - Eo =a + bt + ct .

The heat capacity equation derived therefrom,

ai _
rol °s =b + 2ct ,

retains a temperature dependence, Data obtained both in this Laboratory
and elsevhere have indicated that for some salt mixtures the heat capacity
increases with temperature and for others, decreases with increasing tem

perature. Douglas and co-workers* have observed that for liquid metals

and fused salts the ‘heat capacity. decreases slowly with temperature in
the region near the solidification ‘temperature, may pass through a minimum,

and then may increase at the ‘higher temperatures. On this basis, a general
prediction of ‘the heat capacities of mixtures of various compositions is

not Teadily obtainable, However, ‘the’ value of such a correlation in

engineering. analysis is obvious. Since the curvature of ‘the enthalpy-
temperature equation is, in. most cases, small, it appears feasible to
} attempt a ‘straight-line (two-constant) correlation, yielding the heat

capacity as a constant over the temperature range investigated. The heat
capacity of the liquid can then be related*s€ to such easily calculable
properties of the mixture as the average molecular weight and the average

number of atoms per molecule; thus

vhere M, the average molecular weight, is defined as

N=) Mt,

and N, the average number of atoms per molecule in the mixture, is

¥=) me

In these expressions, M, is the molecular weight of component i, N, is
the number of atoms of component i, and is the mole fraction of com-
ponent i, The constants A and B are empirically determined.

In accord with this discussion, the results of measurements with six
BeFo-containing mixtures are given in Table 1.3.1 and are plotted in Fig.
1.3.3 as a function of the ratio M/N (the average atomic weight). From

this, A and B have been evaluated; the resulting correlation is

This equation represents the available data to within +5% and may be used

within these limits to predict the heat capacities of mixtures containing
various amounts of NaF, LiF, BeFp, UF4, and ThF..

Preliminary data on the enthalpy of the BeLT-15 mixture are presented
in Fig. 1.3.4. The ratio M/R for the mixture is calculated to be 27.L4;
then, from Fig. 1.3.3, the heat capacity is predicted to be 0.285 cal.

Thermal Expansion

A furnace and an inert-atmosphere enclosure have been designed for
the thermal expansion apparatus previously described.” An essential
feature of the furnace design is the inclusion of five independent heat-
ing circuits so as to effect fine control of the temperatures in the two

legs of the U-tube.

Heat Transfer Studies
Assembly of the apparatus for determining surface film formation

 

in molten-salt ‘systems by heat transfer coefficient measurements is pro-

ceeding. All electrical and piping facilities have been installed; sub-
assembly welding of the loop. has been completed. Modular instrument and
control units are being installed in the new laboratory area,

As previously described, 8 the loop will contain two test sections
(see Fig.- 1. 3.5). It is planned to ‘electrically parallel these two test
units, with the pump sides of the sections being maintained at ground

potential, The heat-sink sides of the units will then be electrically
isolated from ground. If the resistances of the two test sections are

not identical (as is the case for an Inconel and INOR-8 pairing), a by-
pass current will exist in the heat-sink leg of the loop. While it is
anticipated that this leakage will be small, its magnitude must be known
in order to effect a heat balance for the test units. Since a current
transformer capable of enduring the temperatures in the vicinity of the
loop is not available, the voltage: drop across this leg and its resistance
will ‘be used to calculate the current. The effect of such a heat-sink

leg. current on ‘the flowmeter is unknown; if it should be appreciable, it

may become necessary to. modify the heating circuits. A possible scheme

sould ‘provide independent: controls for the two units. Again, the pump-
side electrodes would be maintained at ground potential; the I®R heating
of the. sections would then be ‘adjusted to provide Zero voltage difference

between the sink-side electrodes.
The magnitude and effect of heat generation in the Inconel electrodes

are being evaluated.

1.4 INSTRUMENTS AND CONTROLS

Molten-Salt-Fuel Level Indicators

Metallurgical examination of the Q-1717-54 level probe tested pre-

viously’ has been completed. Corrosion was negligible; the probe was in

excellent condition, both mechanically and electrically.

A second series of tests 1s in progress in which two Q-1717-54 level
elements made of Inconel are being tested in fuel 130 (LiF-BeFo-UFy,
62-37-1 mole %) at 1200°F. Initially, as in previous tests, both ele-
ments provided an output of approximately 8.5 mv over a level range of
0-6 in. of fuel. For approximately three days this output was a function
of level, with a sensitivity and reproducibility of +3.,5%., On the fourth
day the span of both probes gradually decreased, This decrease has con-
tinued at a reasonably constant rate until, at present, the span of one
of the probes has decreased to 2.0 mv after two months of continuous
operation. |

When the span of the second probe reached 3.6 mv after 37 days of
continuous operation, the fuel was dumped and the vessel was refilled
with fresh fuel in order to obtain evidence that the probe span decrease
was due to an increase in the resistivity of the fuel with time. The

fresh batch of fuel provided a probe span of 9.0 mv approximately one

day after the filling operation was completed.

Further evidence to support the theory that a fuel resistivity

change’ had occurred vas “obtained by agitating the fuel in one vessel and

measuring the probe. output before and after agitation. The span, after

agitation, ! had increased approximately 3. 0h.

Dynamic Corrosion Studies

INOR-8 Thermal-Convection Loops

Eleven INOR-8 thermal-convection loops were examined during the
quarter; the results are summarized in Table 2.1.1. Nine of the loops
had operated for one year; each of the other two had operated for 1000
hr. All the one-year tests except for loop 1208 revealed only a very
light attack, in the form of surface pitting, along hot-leg sections.

In loop 1208, which circulated salt 12 (NaF-KF-LiF, 11,5-42-46.5 mole %)
at a hot-leg temperature of 1250°F, subsurface voids were also apparent

in hot-leg sections to depths of up to 1 mil. A typical hot-leg section
from this loop is shown in Fig. 2.1.1.

Chemical analyses of salt samples removed from hot- and cold-leg
sections of loop 1208 showed a significant incréase in nickel over the
amount reported to be in the salt before test. Increases in the amounts
of iron and chromium were somewhat less, although analyses of salt samples
from the trap area, which is colder than the circulating salt in the loop,

indicated the presence of 2KF+«NaF.CrFo. All salt samples also contained

~ traces of KF.2H,0, which similarly had been noted in salt samples removed

from Inconel loop 1214, reported previously.t A salt mixture from the

same batch as that used in loop 1208 was circulated in loop 1214 for L670
hr at 1250°F and resulted in extensive attack along hot-leg sections of

the Inconel to a depth of 13 mils. The abnormally high attack in loops 1208
and: 1214 was very ‘Likely ‘associated with the presence of KF» +2H50, since

its ‘presence shows that water, a highly oxidizing impurity, entered the

salt’ during its preparation or testing.

The’ most. extensive attack found among the other loops that had op-
erated for a year occurred. in loop 1212, which circulated salt 125
(NeF- ~BeFo-ThF4-UFs, 53m -b6-0. 5-0.5 mole %) at a maximum temperature of
1250° F. Hot-leg sections from this loop contained surface pits to

approximately 3/4 mil in depth, as shown in Fig. 2.1.2. Loops 1200, 1190,
and 1208, which similarly operated at 1250°F, also showed surface pits
but to smaller depths. However, only shallow surface roughening was evi-
dent in loops operated at a maximum temperature of 1350°F (1219, 1196,
1206, 1215, 1209). Figure 2.1.3 illustrates the appearance of loop 1215,
which contained salt 125 at 1350°F, and is typical of the loops that op~
erated in this temperature range. |

It will be noted in both Figs. 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 that a very thin con-
~ tinuous film has formed along the surfaces exposed to fuel mixtures.
Similar films were observed in the examinations of loops 1196 and 1206;
the composition of these films is not yet known.

Cold-leg surfaces of all the above-mentioned INOR-8 loops showed no
evidence of fluoride attack, although a surface film (similar to the films
described above) was evident on some of the samples. Analyses of salt
mixtures circulated in these loops (except loop 1208) showed no significant
increase in corrosion products during test.

In the 1000-hr INOR-8 tests, salt 136 (LiF-BeFo-UF,, 70-10-20 mole %)
was circulated at maximum hot-leg temperatures of 1250°F (loop 1241) and
1350°F (loop 1242). Loop 124l showed no evidence of attack in hot- or
cold-leg regions. Loop 1242 showed evidence of moderate surface roughen-

ing in sections of the hot leg but no attack in sections of the cold leg.

Inconel Thermal-Conyvection Loops

Examinations were completed of nine Inconel thermal-convection loops
that operated with fluoride mixtures for one year and of three that op-
erated for 1000 hr. Test conditions and metallographic results are re-
ported in Table 2.1.2, Except for loop 1202, all tests which operated
for a year at a maximum temperature of 1250°F revealed intergranular void
formation to a depth of 5 to 7 mils in sections of the hot legs. The
surfaces of the cold-leg regions revealed only heavy surface roughening.
No evidence of mass-transfer deposits was found. Loop 1202, which cir-
culated salt 125 (NaF-BeFo-UF4-ThF4, 53-46-0.5-0.5 mole %) at a maximum
hot-leg temperature of 1250°F, was terminated just short of its scheduled

operating time of one year because of a leak which developed at the bottom

quantity of metallic particles in the trap area of the loop. Chemical
analysis of these particles indicated them to be composed primarily of
chromium, These deposits apparently formed as a result of mass transfer
occurring across the very steep temperature drop which exists in the trap

region of the loop.

INOR-8 Forced-Circulation Loops

An INOR-8 pump loop, 9354-5, which was designed to determine the
compatibility of INOR-8 and graphite in a fluoride fuel medium, was
terminated after successfully completing one year of operation. Graphite

samples for this experiment consisted of thirty-two 1/2-in,-dia rods and

- eighteen 3/16-in.-dia rods, each 11 in. long, stacked in a horizontal

array. The graphite was a low-permeability type, National Carbon grade
GT-123, The rods were contained in a rectangular box constructed of
INOR-8 and located at the outlet of the second heater of a standard
INOR-8 forced-circulation loop, as shown in Fig. 2.1.5. Space was main-
tained between each of the rods and between the rods and the sides of the
box by means of 0.035-in.-dia wire spacers wound around the 1/2-in.-dia

graphite rods. Operating conditions for the experiment were:

Metallographic examination of a section removed from the loop wall
at a point of maximum temperature revealed light surface roughening and
pitting to less than 1/k mil. A layer approximately 1/3 mil thick was
also evident in this sample, as shown in Fig. 2.1.6. A section removed
from the exit end of the graphite container also showed light surface
roughening and a similar but much thinner surface layer, as shown in
Fig. 2.1.7. There was no evidence of carburization found in any of the
sections examined. Identification of surface layers on the sections is
being attempted using x-ray and electron diffraction techniques.

Chemical analyses of the salt before and after the test are shown
in Table 2.1.4. Except for an expected increase in chromium concentra-
tion, the analyses showed little difference. Examinations of the after-
test salt were also made under the petrographic microscope and x-ray
diffraction unit to detect the presence of oxides. These analyses showed
the salt to be apparently unaffected by impurities in the graphite,
although by analytical methods the presence of 3400 ppm of oxides was

 

 

 

 

found.

The first of three INOR-8 corrosion inserts® has been removed from
INOR-8 forced-circulation loop 935L4-k, circulating salt 130 (LiF-BeF5-UF,,
62-37-1 mole %) at a maximum fuel-metal interface temperature of 1300°F.

As previously discussed, these inserts are intended to yield a measure
of corrosion in terms of weight changes which take place at the point of
maximum loop wall temperature. The insert removed had been located at
the end of the second heater leg for 5000 hr.

There was a small weight loss along the b-in. length of the specimen.
This loss, which is an average value for the L-in. length, amounted to
approximately 1.7 * 0.034 mg/cm® and corresponds to a loss of 0.08 + 0.0016
mil of the tube wall if uniform removal of the material is assumed. The
errors listed with these values are based on estimated limits of precision
of ‘the instruments used to measure and weigh the insert. They do not in-
clude errors resulting from handling of the insert, which could be signifi-
cant, considering the small weight change, but are difficult to estimate.
For this reason, care should be exercised in extrapolating these weight
losses beyond the conditions under which they were obtained. Additional
weight measurements to be determined for two other inserts still in test
will afford a sounder basis for such extrapolations.

The present status of all forced-circulation loop tests now in pro-

gress is given in Sec 1.2 of this report.

A second carburization test, similar to the one described above but

at 1300°F. Specimens in separate compartments were exposed to (1) fuel
130 plus graphite, (2) fuel 130 only, and (3) argon. No evidence of car-
burization was observed metallographically in the specimens exposed to
fuel 130 with graphite, and results of mechanical tests and carbon analysis
of these specimens were not significantly different from results for
pieces exposed to fuel 130 only or to argon, again indicating no carburi-

zation.

presented earlier.5
Both materials were heavily carburized (30-40 mils in depth), which
severely affected their room-temperature tensile properties. Elongation
values at room temperature dropped from 45% in 2 in. for control specimens
(exposed to argon) to 6% in 2 in. for the test specimens. .The difference
in elongation values at 1250°F showed less spread; elongation was 19 and

22% in 2 in. for the control and test specimens, respectively.

Penetration.of Graphite by Molten Fluorides

Studies concerning the penetration of graphite by molten fluorides
were continued by using procedures described previously,® except that
the 2372°F (1300°C) graphite degassing operation was eliminated because
such a treatment would be impractical in reactor systems.

Graphite, AGOT grade, was penetrated by fuel 30 (NaF-ZrF4-UF,,
50-46-4 mole %) end by fuel 130 (LiF-BeFz-UF,, 62-37-1 mole %) in 100-hr
exposure tests at 1300°F (706°C) with the systems pressurized to 150 psig.
Table 2.1.6 gives the amount of salt entering the graphite in each test.
The AGOT graphite, a relatively permeable grade, has been used in an
effort to establish the characteristics of salt penetration into graphite.
Low-permeability grades of the type expected to be used for reactor appli-
cation are being acquired for testing.

The difference in the quantity of fuel 130 penetration in tests 1
and 2 (Table 2. 1. 6) vas possibly due to pressure variations in test 2,

‘resulting from an argon leak thet. occurred. during the test and lasted

for ‘approximately 30 hr. =
In most of the future penetration ‘studies, graphite of low perme-
ability will be used, in order to determine: - (1) the quantity and con-
figuration of molten fluoride penetrations into these graphites as func-
tions of pressure, time, and temperature; (2) the mechanisms causing

penetration of void spaces of graphites by the molten fluorides; and

Removal of Oxide Contaminants from Graphite

Previous tests have shown that exposing graphite to fuel 130 will

result in a precipitation of U0s. This precipitation reaction, which is

complete in-5 hr at 1300°F, has occurred in tests where the graphite was

not in direct contact with the salt as well as in tests where the salt

was contained in a graphite crucible.” ® These results suggested that

it might be feasible to remove oxide contaminants from the graphite by
gettering or flushing the graphite with a suitable salt, such as 130.

A gettering test has heen completed in which an empty crucible of
AGOT graphite was heated for 20 hr at 1300°F in a capsule which con-
tained fuel 130 in a compartment separated from the graphite. Uncon-
taminated fuel 130 was then placed in the graphite crucible and the
capsule was again heated to 1300°F for 20 hr. Radiographic examination
after each heating operation showed that the U0, precipitated in the
gettered fuel sample was reduced to approximately one-third of that
normally found in ungettered samples.

In a test to evaluate the ability to flush oxide contaminants from
graphite, a crucible of AGOT graphite’© was exposed to fuel 130 for 20
hr at 1300°F (704°C) in a vacuum atmosphere. As expected, radiographic
examinations indicated a uranium precipitation from the fuel. The ex-
posed fuel and precipitate were then removed from the graphite crucible
and replaced with a fresh charge of fuel 130, and the system was again
heated for 20 hr at 1300°F. A uranium precipitate approximately one-
third of that normally expected with this graphite was observed in radio-
graphs of the test.

Mechanical Properties of INOR-8

The investigation of the high~temperature mechanical properties of
INOR-8 includes tests of properties such as short-time tensile strength,
creep, relaxation, and fatigue. Most of these studies have been in the
temperature range from 1000 to 1500°F in air and in molten-salt environ-
ments. The ‘effects of shape, ‘compositional variations, aging, and car-

burization have ‘been surveyed. ‘Much of this work has been completed and

is reported in past querterly reports, +13 A summary report containing

the detailed results of this program is now being compiled.** In this
quarterly report a general review of the entire program is presented.

In attempting to evaluate the mechanical properties of INOR-8 in"
relation to those of other high-temperature alloys, it is interesting
to consider that most of the heats tested were experimental. Thus the
composition and melting practice did not conform to the specifications
now established. However, in spite of these variations the properties
were fairly consistent, especially with regard to creep behavior. Thus
significant variations in properties would not be expected in future
heats of the alloy.

Although the program represents a fairly comprehensive study of the
mechanical properties, there are several importent areas which have not
received sufficient attention. These include strain fatigue in the fused-
salt environment, multiaxial-stress-rupture tests on wrought and weld

metal, and radiation-damage studies.

Materials

Five heats of INOR-8 have been studied: SP-16, SP-19, 8 M-1, 1327,
and 1566. These heats have carbon contents of 0.02, 0.06, 0.1k, 0.1k,
and 0.08%, respectively. Heat SP-16 is unusually high in boron (0.02-0.03%)
and exhibits brittleness when welded. Heats 8 M-1l and 1327 have higher
carbon contents than that set forth in the maximum specification. Heat
1327 is an arc-cast vacuun~remelted heat with a composition nearly identi-

cal with that of 8 M-1.

Tensile Properties

Tensile tests on sheet material indicate that INOR-8 has good strength
between 1000 and 1500°F. The 0.2%-offset yield strength exhibits very

‘little temperature dependence and falls in a band between 25,000 and 40,000

psi in this temperature range. Heats 8 M-1 and 1327 appear to be the
strongest materials, and data for these heats lie near the top of the
band. Heats SP-16 and SP-19 fall near the lower limit.

Tensile tests on rod specimens agree, in general, with sheet data
except for heat SP-19, which shows considerable scatter. Yield strengths
as low as 21,000 psi have been observed between 1000 and 1500°F for SP-19
rods.

The tensile ductility also varies from heat to heat. Maximum and
minimum tensile elongations are constant up to 1000°F, but rapidly de~
crease between 1000 and 1500°F. Sheet specimens of heats 8 M-1 and 1327
exhibit minimum elongation. Minimum values are near 35% up to 1000°F
and drop to 10% at 1500°F. Heat SP-16 is the most ductile, with elonga-
tions as high as 67% for rod specimens and 55% for sheet specimens.

Heat SP-19 falls between 8 M-1 and SP-16, and its ductility at 1500°F
appears to be improved by aging at 1650°F. Aging studieslS on SP-19
and 8 M-1 reveal no pronounced aging effects for temperatures up to

1400°F, however,

Creep Tests

Long-time creep data on INOR-8 sheet specimens have been obtained
at 1100, 1200, and 1300°F in molten salt, Several tests at 1100 and
1200°F are still in progress, after more than 10,000 hr, without reaching
1% strain. Tests which have been run at 1250°F in air indicate that the
creep strength of INOR-8 is comparable with that of type 316 stainless
steel, Comparison of tests in alr and salt shows that there is no pro-
nounced weakening effect due to the static salt environment. All heats,
except 1566, exhibit similar creep properties when tested in salt. Heat
1566 is weaker at 1200 and 1300°F then eny other heat. |

Relaxation Tests - Fo

~~ Relaxation data are available from 1200 to 1600°F. At 1200°F the
relaxation rate is appreciable, For example, the maximum stress supported
after 2000 hr at 1200°F is 4000 psi.
Dimensional Instability = -
| Relaxation and low-stress creep tests have indicated that some

dimensional instability may occur in certain heats of INOR-8; dilatometry

has supported this conclusion. The change in the linear dimension,

however, may be either positive or negative depending on the test. In

any case, the change is so small as to be negligible in most instances.

Fatigue Studies
| - Fatigue studies have been conducted on SP-19 by the Battelle Memorial

Institute under a subcontract. Three temperatures, 1100, 1300, and 1500°F,
were employed. Two frequencies, 100 and 3000 cps, were used. The results
show that when the grain size is fine the alloy has good fatigue strength
at elevated temperatures. No frequency effect was observed at 1100°F,

but at 1500°F a pronounced difference occurs. The high-frequency tests
endure a greater number of cycles before failure.

It was discovered that there was a marked difference in the grain

 

size between two billets of heat SP-19 used in preparing the fatigue speci-
mens. As expected, the fine-grain material exhibited superior fatigue

resistance. .

Carburization

In comparing the effect of the nominal carbon level on the tensile
properties, it has been noted that heats 1327 and 8 M-1, which are high
in carbon, exhibit only slightly higher tensile strengths than the low-

. carbon heats. The yield strength is significantly increased and the
tensile ductility is lowered by the increased carbon level,

Studies of the tensile properties of carburized specimens (sP-19)
possessing a high-carbon case also indicate that the yield strength is
increased while the ductility is reduced by carburization.

Creep tests on carburized and homogenized specimens have been per-
formed at temperatures between 1300 and 1800°F. These tests show that
carburization increases the creep strength. The degree of strengthening
increases with the test temperature. A comparison of the creep properties
of the high-carbon heats, 8 M-1 and 1327, with SP-16 and SP-19, however,

reveals that no significant strengthening or weakening occurs below 1300°F.

Materials Fabrication Studies

Triplex Heat Exchanger Tubing
Work is continuing on the development of techniques for cladding

prefabricated porous nickel tubes on the outer and inner surfaces with

Inconel or INOR-8 to provide triplex heat exchanger tubing with a leak-
detecting component. The initial attempt to clad with Inconel was carried
out with a sample piece of grade F porous nickel (o. 0008-1in. mean pore
opening) received from Micro Metallic Corporation. The method of com-

core-to-core joints were found to be separated to a maximum of 3/8 in,
It is not known whether the core separations occurred during assembly,
the pointing operation (swaging), or drawing. Future experiments will
be designed to determine the cause and remedy of this difficulty. Addi-
tional studies on the 9-ft triplex will include evaluation of bond quality,
permeability of the core, and ability of the tube to be bent into a U-

Welding and Brazing Studies

Welding of INOR-8

A summary report covering the welding characteristics and weld-metal
mechanical properties of Hastelloy B, Hastelloy W, and INOR-8 has been
completed.”

Studies are continuing in an effort to improve the high-temperature

ductility of INOR-8 weld metal. Small additions of aluminum, titanium,
mangenese, silicon, boron, and magnesium to the vacuum-melted basic charge
of INOR-8 resulted in a slight improvement of the weld-metal ductility
at 1500°F.1% A more substantial improvement has been accomplished, however,
with a 2% niobium addition to the basic charge followed by deoxidation and
purification with aluminum, etc., as described above. A reduction in the
carbon content from 0.06 to 0.03% also resulted in a marked improvement
in ductility with only a minor reduction of the tensile strength. The
results of mechanical-property tests on several heats of INOR-8 weld
metal are summarized in Table 2.1.7. Tn view of the highly promising
characteristics of the alloy containing 2% niobium, approximately 90 1b
© of this composition has been vacuum cast for fabrication into inert-arc
weld wire for subsequent experimentation. A portion of this wire will
‘also be submitted to various vendors for the application of electrode

‘coatings suitable for metallic-arc studies.

The influences of small variations in the amount of silicon, titanium,
and magnesium additions upon the ductility at 1500°F were also investigated,
but the resulte to date are inconclusive. The ductility at 1500°F, however,
appears to be very sensitive to small variations in weld-metal chemistry.
The chemical factors should therefore be carefully controlled, and it is
highly desirable that each particular heat be evaluated to determine its
suitability for high-temperature service. It also appears that the welding

procedure should be controlled to minimize dilution of the base metal.

2.2 CHEMISTRY AND RADIATION EFFECTS

Phase Equilibrium Studies

The System NaF-ThF,-UF,

A preliminary phase diagram (Fig. 2.2.1) has been obtained for the
system NaF-ThF,-UF,. The close similarity between Th** (radius 1.05 A)
and U*t (radius 1.10 A) results in extensive solid-solution formation,
which is of some practical advantage since it decreases the extent of
segregation on cooling; also, from the standpoint of crystallography
and phase behavior, there are many surprising complexities, several of
which are not yet resolved. For example, in spite of dissimilar stoichi-
ometry, the compounds 3NaF.UF, and UNaF:ThF, form solid solutions, 3NaF.
(U,Th)F4-UNaF«(U,Th)F,, between both the high- and low-temperature modi-
fications of these compounds. These solid solutions appear to exhibit
a continuous primary-phase field along the 3NaF.UF,-UNaF.ThF, composition:
line. The binary compounds 3NaF.UF, and 4NaF.ThF, have no equilibrium
stability at low temperatures, nor do the ternary solid solutions. Other
examples of unusual behavior are the following.

Phase relationships along the line between 2NaF.ThF, and 2NaF.UF,
involve an immiscibility gap between compounds of the same formula but
of different crystal structure, as shown in Fig. 2.2.2.

‘The compounds 3NaF.2ThF, and S5NaF.3UF, form face-centered-cubic
crystals with unit cell edges differing by. less than 0.5 KR. The two
compounds form solid solutions, but, on the basis of preliminary evidence,
do not appear to have a continuous primary-phase field in the system
NeF-ThF4-UF.. Both compounds are unstable at low temperatures, and the
solid solutions between them are not preserved in slowly cooled melts.

A large primary-phase field of the solid solution TNaF.6(U,Th)F,-
occurs, although the compound Ther. GTR does not appear as an equilibrium
phase in the system NaF-ThF,.

Although the compounds NeF+2ThF, and NaF+2UF, are not isostructural,
some solid solution does occur along the NaF.2ThF,-NaF.2UF, composition

line. The compound NaF.2UF,, subsolidus in the binary system, does not

appear as a primary phase in the ternary system.

The System NaF-BeFo-ThF,

Recent results from thermal analysis and thermal-gradient quenching
experiments have shown that in the system NaF-BeFp-ThF, the compounds
NaF.BeF, and ThF, form a quasi-binary system, as illustrated in Fig. 2.2.3.
The system contains a ternary compound, NaF<BeFp+3ThF4. The occurrence
of the primary-phase field of this compound has been reported previously.
The compound NaFe.BeFo+3ThF, may be said to melt semicongruently in the
ternary system NaF-BeFs-ThF,, although it melts incongruently in the
quasi-binary system NaF.BeFo-ThF,; this emphasizes the point that the
maximum temperature on the boundary line between the primary-phase fields
of ThF, and NaF.BeFp+3ThF, occurs at the peritectic on the quasi-binary,
that is, at NeF-BeFo-ThF, (38-38-24 mole %) and 730°C. The eutectic in
the system NaF+BeFo-ThF, has the composition NaF-BeFp-ThF, (49-49-2
mole %), mp 374°C. This eutectic invariant point is also the maximum
temperature on the boundary line between the primary-phase fields of
NaF+.BeF> and NaF+BeFo+3ThF, in the ternary system NaF-BeFo-ThF,.

The compound NaF«BeFo«3ThF,, which has not been described in the
literature, has now been defined with respect to optical properties and

x-ray diffraction pattern.

The System NaF-PuFg
Investigations on the NaF-PuFs system are part of a study of phase

relationships in the ternary systems NaF-BeFo-PuFs and LiF-BeFo-PuFg,
which have been found to dissolve sufficient PuFs at 550 to 650°C for
use in reactors.® Preliminary thermal analysis data obtained with
NaF-PuFs mixtures containing 5 to 30 mole % PuFs, supplemented by micro-
scoplc examination of the slowly cooled melts, indicate the existence of
8 eutectic between NaF and a binary compound presumed to be NaPuF,. The
eutectic composition melts at 727 * 3°C, the lowest liquidus temperature

in the binary, and contains between 20 and 25 mole % PuFs.

Cryoscopy in NaF

As an aid in correlating the thermodynamic properties of molten
fluorides with the constitution of the fuels, cryoscopic measurements
have been carried out on 120-g samples of NaF solutions contained in a
freezing point apparatus made of nickel and having a diameter of 2 in.
Freezing points were found with an estimated accuracy of *0.6°C from
cooling curves obtained with a Pt—Pt-Rh thermocouple inserted in a well
extending 2 in. below the surface of the liquid. Temperature and cool-
ing rates were regulated manually by means of an autotransformer in con-
junction with a 5-in.-dia pot furnace and a nickel-block thermostat. The
melts were protected from the atmosphere and stirred with argon. The
effect of alkaline earth cations, shown in Table 2.2.1, reflects the
increasing deviation from ideality found for smaller solute ion size.
Most simply interpreted, fluoride ions are more strongly complexed the

smaller the cation.

Gas Solubilities in Molten Fluorides

 

Solubility of Xenon in LiF-BeFo
The solubility of xenon in LiF-BeFs (64-36 mole %) has been deter-

mined over a pressure range of 0 to 2 atm at 500 to 800°C. Plots of these
 

 

 

 

79

data as a function of pressure indicate that Henry's law 1s followed and
that the solubility constants are 1.55 X 107°, 2.33 x 1079, 3,33 x 1079,
5.05 x 1072, and 8.63 x 10”° moles of Xe per cubic centimeter of melt
per atmosphere at 500, 600, 700, and 800°C, respectively. A heat of
solution of 12,000 cal/mole was calculated from these constants.

Solubility of CO» in NaF-BeFo

The relatively low melting point of NaF-BeFo (57-43 mole %) per-
mitted measurements of the solubility of CO at temperatures as low as
415°C; these were of interest in confirming the previously reported
minimum observed in the plot of the logarithm of the Henry's law con-
stant vs the reciprocal of the absolute temperature. Saturating pres-
sures from O to 2 atm of CO at 415°C gave rise to a Henry's law con-
stant of (10.36 + 0.45) x 1078 moles of COz per cubic centimeter of
melt per atmosphere, compared with 7 x 10-8 at 600°C. Thus, from 415
to 600°C, COz exhibits the usual negative temperature coefficient of
solubility, as does HF in fluoride solvents; at temperatures greater
than 600°C, COz has the less familiar positive temperature coefficient

encountered with the noble gases.

Solubility of Rare-Earth Fluorides

The solubility data for CeFg in LiF-BeFo-UFy (73-6-21 mole bY and
LiF-BeFo-ThF,-UF. (72- -15. 5- -11. 5- -1 mole %) in Table 2.2.2, obtained from
radioactive tracer measurements’ on Filtered samples of saturated liquid,
should serve as reasonable estimates of the total solubility in mole
fraction of any combination of rare-earth fluorides in these fuel com-
‘positions. It has been previously demonstrated that the rare-earth

cations are approximately equivalent from the standpoint of solubility.

On a molar basis, solubilities of CeFs in solvents having high con-
centrations of thorium and/or uranium are approximately three to four
times higher than those previously found in the LiF-BeFo (63-37 mole %)
solvent. An effect in this direction was expected because the higher
LiF concentration (basic constituent) is conducive to stronger complexing
and enhanced solubility; however, a partial neutralization of such an
effect, due to the substitution of ThF, and UF, (acidic) for BeFp (acidic),
was not as large as expected, indicating that ThF, and UF, are not much

stronger acids than BeFpo.

Precipitation of Rare-Earth Fluorides by Cooling

Exploratory experiments directed toward fuel reprocessing have been
made on the feasibility of removing rare-earth fluorides from a fuel by
means of a "cold finger." Two devices were tested, one using hydrogen
gas as a coolant, the other using water.

Seven of nine tests gave useful results, but the apparatus was not
amenable to precise control. On the average, 0.16 g of salt containing
25 wt % CeFs was frozen and removed from a comparatively large amount of
LiF-BeFs (63-37 mole % with 4 wt % CeFg) during test periods which did
not exceed 2 hr. Varying the type of coolant for the same area of the
cooling surface seemed to have no effect. However, the transfer of heat

from the flange top to the cold finger had a marked influence on the

x

 
 

 

81

efficiency of the process. Attempts will be. made to insulate the finger
from the flange for subsequent tests.

Another type of experiment, also related to reprocessing schemes to
remove rare-earth fluorides, is under way; this is the measurement of

the kinetics of the exchange
Ce¥Fa(d) + LaFs(ss) = LaFz(d) + CexFs(ss)

where 4d and ss denote dissolved and solid solution.

Reactions of UF, with Oxides in Molten Fluoride Solvents

The reactions of various oxides with components of a fused-salt
reactor fuel are being investigated to determine the feasibility of fuel
reprocessing by oxide precipitation reactions and to develop an under-
standing of the behavior of these oxides with respect to reactor opera-
tion. The reactions of water vapor and beryllium oxide with UF. in
molten fluorides are of current interest. The behavior of various
structural-metal oxides as well as fission-product oxides is also of

interest to reactor fuel technology.

Reaction of UF, with BeO

The precipitation of UOp by reaction of BeO with UF, in fused salt
solvents has been considered as a reprocessing scheme. The process has
been studied by an extraction column method,® and it has been shown that
the reaction is controlled by the surface area of the BeO particles.®
Three experiments were conducted to study the efficiency of this reaction
by contacting BeO particles (>325 mesh) with about 8 wt % of UF, in the
solvents LiF-BeFs (63-37 mole %), LiF-KF (50-50 mole %), and LiF-NaF
(60-40 mole %). With a 50% excess of BeO, the reaction was about 96%
complete within 30 min in each case. These reactions are illustrated in
Fig. 2.2.4. The uranium concentration at the completion of these experi-
ments was 1520 ppm in LiF-BeFz, 355 ppm in LiF-KF, and 190 ppm in LiPF-NaF.

In a separate experiment, the addition of a fivefold excess of Be0
(>325 mesh) to a mixture containing CeFs (2 wt %) in LiF-BeFs (63-37
mole %) failed to precipitate a significant amount of cerium, as deter-
mined by radiochemical analysis of the filtrate.

These experiments are further demonstrations that beryllium oxide
might be effective in separating uranium from the rare-earth fluoride

fission products in a fused-salt reactor fuel.

Reaction of UF, with Strontium Oxide

A systematic investigation of the reactions of various metal oxides
with UF, and CeFs in mixtures of LiF-BeFp (63-37 mole %) and LiF-NaF
(60-40 mole %) is being continued. The reaction of strontium oxide with
UF, and CeFs in LiF-NaF (60-40 mole %) at 750°C is illustrated in Fig.
2.2.5. These results, showing sharply selective metathetical end points,
are consistent with those obtained for the reactions of Ca0 and Ba0 with

UF4 and CeFs in this same solvent.

Reaction of UF, with Structural-Metal Oxides?

The reactions with the oxides of various structural metals used in
equipment containing fused fluoride mixtures are of interest in connection
with maintenance problems and other opportunities for oxide contamination.
In three experiments, NiO, Fez0a, and Cro0s5 were added independently to
a mixture containing approximately 1 mole % UF, in LiF-NaF (60-40 mole %)
at 750°C. The results are illustrated in Fig. 2.2.6. Equilibrium con-
ditions were probably not. attained, end further experiments will be re-
quired to explain the aifferences in reactivity.

saturation of the melt with nickel (approximately 3000 ppm) and a con-
stant though small consumption of oxygen were noted. Examinations of
filtered and unfiltered salt samples by x-ray diffraction and petro-
graphy indicated no apparent alterations of the melt by the imposed con-
ditions. Further experiments are planned to check the preliminary in-
dications that air reacted with the wall rather than the melt, producing
NiO, and that the reaction of NiO with the melt was too incomplete to

give a detectable precipitation of UOz.

Chemistry of Corrosion Processes

Solubility and Thermodynamic Properties of NiFo in LiF-BeF,

The solubility of NiF, in LiF-BeF, (62-38 mole %) is of considerable
interest since it has been established that pure NiFs, rather than a com-
pound or solid solution, is the saturating phase. This means that the

measured equilibrium quotients for the reaction
NiFz(d) + Hp = 2HF + Ni

which provide a value for the free energy of formation of NiFz in solution,
can be extended to the saturated solution to yield the free energy of for-
mation of solid NiFs and thus furnish an experimental check of the litera-

ture value.
The evidence that pure NiFz is the saturating phase was obtained

from petrographic and x-ray examination, as well as from the fact that
no difference in saturation ‘solubility was obtained regardless of the
amount of NiFs added.

The recently measured solubilities , (precision +3%), supplanting pre-

It is interesting to note that if a previously reported® value for

in 2 x 10™3 mole fraction NiFs solution at 600°C is assumed to hold for

the saturated solution, the standard free energy of formation of solid
NiFs is «123 kcal/mole, compared with a published value of -125 kcal/mole.
The calculations leading to this result imply that the activity coefficient
of NiFz, based on pure supercooled liquid as standard state, is about 400.
Such a marked positive deviation from Raoult's law ideality is difficult

to reconcile with previous experience, vhich indicated that no marked posi-
tive deviations are encountered in solutions of this type. The discrepancy,
if the limitation of positive deviation is a real one, might be rectified
by a higher value for Ky» a higher solubility, or a lower standard free
energy of formation of HF. A higher value of Ky is the more likely ex-
planation; otherwise nitt in fuel solvents is highly exceptional in its
behavior. The value of Ky in the saturated solution is difficult to
measure by current techniques because of high HF and low Hp content of

the equilibrium gas.

Tracer Analyses for Determining Efficacy of Reducing Agents

Previous work directed toward improving the religbility of analytical
procedures related to corrosion studies© demonstrated that zr° would com-
pletely remove labeled FeFp dissolved in an NaF-ZrF, (53-147 mole %) mix-

‘ture. This type of study was extended to the reduction of the labeled

FeFo by Ho and cr® at 600°C. With Hp, the Fe content was reduced from
950 to approximately 10 ppm in three days, and to approximately 2 ppm in

six days. With cr, 690 ppm of Fe in solution was reduced below the limit

of detection within 6 hr.

Another experiment was performed to demonstrate the removal of CrFs
by 7r° at 600°C and to check the wet analysis data for low Cr contents;
a solution containing 560 ppm of cr’ was treated with zr°. Wet analyses
confirmed the elimination of CrFp. However, for all the experiments, re-
sults of wet analyses for the Fe content of the reduced solvents unaccount-
ably ranged from 135 to 155 ppm, indicating that an unidentified source

of contamination is still interfering with the analyses.

Analyses of Corrosion-Test Loops

 

Periodic sampling of the melts in three forced-circulation corrosion-
test loops has continued. The chromium concentration in loop MSRP-12
(INOR-8), which reached a steady-state level of 550 ppm after 1200 hr of

operation, is still maintaining that level after 4000 hr of operation.

The salt charge is LiF-BeFo-ThF4-UF, (62.0-36.5-1.0-0.5 mole %).

Loop 9371-5 (Inconel), which has shown an increase in chromium con-

centration well beyond values possible without extraneous oxidation, may

“be approaching saturation. At 3100 hr of operation, the chromium content

of the melt had risen to 3050 ppm. Unfortunately, a pump failure at this
point caused the loop to be shut down, and the salt vas drained into the
sump. Since the sump had not been drained after the initial loading of
the loop, considerable dilution of the loop salt resulted. Samples of
the melt in the loop were taken immediately after the pump was repaired

and the loop started. The chromium concentration had dropped to 1800 ppm,

indicating a dilution of about 30% in the shutdown mixing. After re-
starting, the chromium content in the melt climbed to 2350 ppm in 72 hr.
At 4000 hr of operation, the chromium had again reached the 3000-ppm
level. The salt charge in this loop is the same as for loop MSRP-12.

Loop MSRP-13 (INOR-8) has been started recently, using LiF-BeFo-UF,
(70-10-20 mole %). After 900 hr of operation, the chromium content in
the melt had risen from 160 to 210 ppm, which is lower than expected in
view of the high UF, concentration.

Stability of Zirconium Monochloride in Air
1"

A new commercial product known as "Zirklor," stated to be a graphite-

" like product having the formula ZrCl, has been recommended as a lubricant

and elastic packing material for use at temperatures up to 1000°C. tt
There was reason to suspect that the product would be unstable in air,
though the commercial literature stresses the marked thermal stability
of the material.

An evaluation for MSR application revealed that samples gained weight
in air at room temperature, showed evidence of severe attack on heating to

325°C, and reacted completely with air according to the equation
4ZrCl + 302 — 3Zr0z + ZrCl,

in 15 hr at 800°C. It was concluded that the material was unsuitable

for uses which involve exposure to oxidizing agents.

“change.

The graphite, after calipering and weighing, had been degassed in
the loop under vacuum for 24 hr at 1100°F and repressurized with argon
before charging with salt. A flow rate of 1.1 gpm was maintained, causing
an effective head due to pumping of 10 psi. An additional pressure of
% psig, due to the helium cover pressure, resulted in a total pressure of
1% psig on the graphite. Dimensional changes for the thirteen 1/2-in.-
dia rods for which data were obtained corresponded to an average loss of
less than 0.5 mil in diameter; this is close to the probable error of
the measurements, Otherwise, there was no evidence of erosion. Weight
losses, which varied from negligible to 0.05% and averaged 0.02%, could
possibly be attributed to desorption of residual gases from the graphite;
no statistically significant differences were noted between the thirteen
1/2-in,-dia rods and eight 3/16-in,-dia rods for which weight data vere
available. Chemical analyses of the graphite are not yet finished, bub
the indications are that traces of uranium, of the order of a few parts
per million, will be found. This may represent vapor phase deposition
as a consequence of reaction with residual oxides in the graphite, and
thus could presumably be avoided by pretreating the graphite with Hp at
600°C. ' The chromium content of the salt increased from 135 to 550 ppm

during the year's operation.

Permeability of Graphite by Molten Fluorides

An initial objective was to saturate graphite with a high-melting
inert salt, LiF-MgFs (67.5-32.5 mole %), in order to ascertain whether
further penetration of the graphite by typical reactor fuels containing
uranium was prevented or decreased. t?

Test rods, 1/4, 1/2, and 1 in. in diameter by 3 in. long, were
machined from AGOT graphite. The rods were mounted on a rack in a
nickel can and degassed at 900°C for 24 hr in a 100-p vacuum. While
still under vacuum, the rods were covered with the LiF-MgF. melt at

900°C, and then a helium pressure of 15 psig was applied. The temperature

Nn

and pressure were held at these levels for 48 hr, after which the pres-
sure was released and the salt was pumped away from the graphite rods.

Weight gains of 12.5%, equivalent to filling about half the void
volume, were obtained. To determine the distribution of the salt in
the graphite rods, machine cuttings 1/32 in. deep were taken from the
1/2- and 1-in.-dia rods and analyzed for lithium and magnesium. The 1/k-in.
rods were submitted for analysis without machining. Within analytical
error, the salt had penetrated uniformly to the center of the rod with-
out change in composition or concentration. Micrometer measurements of
the rods before and after treatment showed no dimensional change.

Since the LiF-MgF» mixture melts at T42°C and the normal operating
temperatures of a reactor might be as low as about 675°C, it was of in-
terest to soak samples of AGOT graphite rods, prepermeated with LiF-MgFp,
in a fuel salt such as LiF-BeFs-UF, (62-371 mole %) at 675°C under 1
psig of helium for 1000 hr. The resulting weight changes were small
(+0.2%), and since they were both positive and negative, little signifi-
cance could be attached to them, Micrometer measurements of the rods
again showed no dimensional change. |

Successive cuttings (1/32 in. deep) were machined from the 1/2- and
l-in.-dia rods and submitted for analysis to determine the amount and
depth of uranium and beryllium penetration. The 1/b4-in.-dia rods were
submitted for uranium and beryllium analysis without machining. Table

2.2, 4 shows typical results obtained on the machined samples. It was

obvious. from the results that the uranium and beryllium, were penetrating

well, and that, in general, “the beryllium appeared to diffuse into the
prepermeated graphite. faster ‘then the uranium. There is also an indica-

tion that ‘the ‘uranium coucentration goes through a minimum, both abso-

:  lutely and. relative to the veryLitum, ‘between the outer and central por-

tions’ of the rods.

 

LE Additional experiments confirmed this ‘general behavior for other
types of - ‘graphite, - such 8s TSF. and code 82, and for slightly different
fuel compositions. The minima in ‘the uranium concentrations were most

pronounced for the code 82 graphites, and the uranium concentrations in

the center were so high as to suggest localized deposits of UO=. The
code 82 graphites resisted penetration by the LiF-MgF, mixture and also
contained relatively little fuel.

For comparison with results on samples which were preimpregnated
with LiF-MgFs, short-term experiments were run by using the techniques
described above for impregnation, but substituting reactor fuels for
the LiF-MgF, mixture. Slight modifications, such as in the degassing
temperature, were made in the procedure to simulate probable reactor
operating temperatures. The fuels permeated ordinary graphites to an
extent corresponding to about 10% of the void volume of the graphite in
test periods of 6 to 48 hr, and minima in the uranium concentration as
a function of distance were usually found.

Some of the samples were special graphites obtained from National
Carbon: CS-312-0 was untreated graphite; CS-312-2 was specially treated
to make CS-312-0 impervious; and R-0018 was a special low-permeability
graphite. At the operating pressures involved, the impervious graphites
resisted penetration, showing weight losses rather than gains. Graphite
R-0013 was a special high-density graphite which had received no previous
treatment to make it impervious; it behaved about like AGOT with respect
to permeation. Tests involving 1000-hr exposures are now in progress.
Preliminary indications are that fuels containing 13 to 15 mole % ThF, will
penetrate graphite more readily, in response to pressure, than fuels con-
taining UF, without ThFy. This result seems to be related to a tendency
for UF, to form UOz precipitates which partially plug the graphite; thorium

tetrafluoride seems to make the oxide more soluble.

~-- Preparation of Purified Materials
Purification, Transfer, and Service Operations
‘The purification processing of molten fluorides of various composi-
tions increased sharply during the quarter to approximately 120 kg of
mixtures containing no beryllium fluoride and 510 kg of beryllium-con-
taining mixtures. Transfer and service operations increased in a similar

fashion.

Reactions of Stannous Fluoride

 

Stannous fluoride, a useful oxidant for preparing simple fluorides
from metals, 13,14 has also been found useful for preparing complex fluo-
rides. Chromium metal reacted with a molten mixture of stannous fluoride
and lithium fluoride to yield lithium hexafluochromate(III):

2Cr + 3SnFz + 6LiF — 2LisCrFg + 3Sn

The corresponding treatment of vanadium metal gave a product with an’

x-ray diffraction pattern slightly shifted from that of lithium hexa-
fluochromate(III); so, presumsbly, it was lithium hexafluovenadate(III).
Molten stannous fluoride reduced cupric fluoride, bismuth trifluo-
ride, and antimony trifluoride to the free metals. The other product of
these reactions, presumably stannic fluoride, appeared not to have melted
at any temperature up to 500°C. These reductions are surprising, because
publishedl® thermodynamic estimates give considerably unfavorable energy

differences for their occurrence.

Radiation Effects

INOR-8 Thermal-Convection Loop for Operation in the LITR

 

Assembly of the in-pile thermal-convection loop for testing fused
salt fuel in INOR-8 tubing at the LITR was completed, and the loaded
loop was installed in its outer can. This loop, which contains LiF-BeFp-UF,
(62-37-1 mole %), will be operated at a later date in the LITR. |

In-Pile Static Corrosion Tests

Two fused-salt capsules have been in the MTR for three months. This
is the longest test period for a fused-salt in-pile experiment to date.
The two capsules are made of INOR-8 and contain Li7F-BeFo-UP35F, (62-37-1
mole %). The capsules are operating at 1250°F and had an initial power

density of 1200 w/ce. They have accumulated approximately 1700 hr of
operating time. It is estimated, based on flux and duration of the
exposure, that approximately 50% of the U235 has been consumed by fission
at this time. Irradiation of these capsules will be continued until the
uranium in the fused salt no longer holds the capsule at operating tem-
perature. After irradiation, the capsule will be subjected to metallo-
graphic examination to determine the extent of corrosion.

A total of 47 fused-salt capsules have been placed in the MIR, giving
a combined operating time of 24,97h hr or 2.85 years; the average irradia-
tion time was 531 hr. Most of these capsules were Inconel, contained zir-
conium-base fluoride fuel, and were operated at 1500 or 1600°F. The amount
of corrosion observed by metallography was considered negligible and was
the same as that observed for control experiments operated without radia-
tion. Four capsules contained beryllium fluoride in the fuel and were
held at 1250°F for an average exposure of 1600 hr; two of these are still

being irradiated.

2.3 FUEL PROCESSING

Work has continued on the HF dissolution process for recovery of
the LiF-BeFo carrier salt following uranium recovery by the fluoride
volatility process. It is based on dissolution of LiF and BeFas in
about 90% aqueous HF, in which the major nuclear poisons are insoluble,
followed by evaporation of the HF and water to reconstitute the carrier
salt. An alternative process is dissolution in anhydrous HF, which
gives better decontamination and LiF recovery but results in the loss
of most of the BeFo. A flowsheet based on the 90% HF dissolution pro-
cess has been presented previously.»

The possibility of dissolving uranium along with the carrier salt,
or at least the LiF, is under investigation. Simultaneous dissolution
of the uranium and lithium fluoride would permit elimination of the
volatility step for the fuel salt, resulting in a one-step process with
a considerable saving in plant complexity, equipment, and operation.
Experiments are also being carried out on the partial decontamination
of reprocessed LiF from fission products that are soluble in HF. De-
contamination of LiF from soluble fission products, such as cesium,
will be required on a much slower schedule than rare-earth removal since
the soluble fission products have smaller cross sections. Unless re-
moved, however, they may eventually build up in the fuel salt until

they are significant poisons.

UFg Solubility in HF-ClFa

Preliminary experiments indicate that the addition of ClFs to
anhydrous HF oxidizes UF, to UFg, which should be somewhat soluble in
the HF solution of fused salts. The solubility of UFg in anhydrous HF
at the boiling point? is over 100 g per kilogram of HF and it increases

steadily as ClF3 is added, but the large amount of LiF and BeFs in
the solution of fuel salt would be expected to decrease this consider-
ably. In laboratory experiments, the solubility of uranium from fuel
salt (LiF-BeFo-ThF,-UFy, 62-36.5-1.0-0.5 mole %) in anhydrous HF-C1Fs
solutions has generally been in the range 2 to 3 g/kg, and occasionally
twice as high. However, in these same experiments very little of the
LiF and BeFp was found in the solution. In order to check the effect
of C1F5; on LiF and BeF» solubilities in HF, an experiment was carried
out in which C1Fs; was added to the extent of 25 vol % to anhydrous HF
saturated with LiF and BeFp. No precipitation occurred, and analysis
of the final solution showed 100 g of LiF and 15 g of BeFs per kilo-
gram. The discrepancy between the low results in the earlier experi-
ments and the results in the later one:ils not understood, but it may
be a result of the experimental apparatus.

Although good solubility data have not yet been obtained for the
ClF5-HF solvent system, the results indicate sufficient promise to war-
rant further investigation. A flowsheet based on this system would
differ from that presented previously! in the following respects: the
fuel fluorination operation would be eliminated; the dissolver would
operate with anhydrous HF containing ClF5; all the LiF and uranium would
be dissolved and recovered in the evaporator; but most of the BeF. would
go with the waste, and new BeFp would have to be added to the evaporator
or purification equipment to compensate for this loss. In order to eval-

uate this system properly, better solubility date must be obtained for

‘the fuel salt components, and ‘the effect of C1Fa on fission product

solubilities must be investigated. Tt should also be mentioned that

other solvent systems involving anhydrous HF as one component may dis-
solve uranium from: the fuel salt, “and tests of some of these are planned.

Separation of LiF from CSF

A Laboratory experiment indicated that CsF can be separated from
LiF by dissolution of the fuel salt in 90% HF followed by partial instead

 

SG. P. Rutledge and W. Davis, Jr., J. Phys. Chem. 63, 166 (1959).

 
 

 

 

 

98

of complete evaporation. A 90% HF solution containing 80 g of LiF, 48
g of BeFp, and 2 g of CsF per kilogram, together with tracer Cs137, was
evaporated to gbout one-fourth its volume; a crystalline solid formed
during the evaporation. The solution remaining was 42.5% HF, and it
contained 65% of the cesium activity and only 2% of the LiF.

Evaporation of 90% HF yields a decreased volume of more dilute HF,

because the vapor is greatly enriched in HF, until the HF-H-0 azeotrope
is reached. The LiF solubility decreases rapidly as the HF concentra-
tion is decreased, * and most of the LiF precipitates from the solution
as it is evaporated. The major heavy fission product soluble in 90% HF
is cesium, which would build up in the fuel until eventually it would
become a significant poison. However, CsF is soluble in both water and
HF, so it might be expected to remain in solution as the HF concentra-
tion decreased during the evaporation. The experiment confirms that
nearly all the LiF is precipitated and that most of the CsF remains in

solution, as does the BeFgz.
