CHAPTER 14
NUCLEAR ASPECTS OF MOLTEN-SALT REACTORS*

The ability of certain molten salts to dissolve uranium and thorium salts
in quantities of reactor interest made possible the consideration of fluid-
fueled reactors with thorium in the fuel, without the danger of nuclear ac-
cidents as a result of the settling of a slurry. This additional degree -of
freedom has been exploited in the study of molten-salt reactors.

Mixtures of the fluorides of alkali metals and zirconium or beryllium, as
discussed in Chapter 12, possess the most desirable combination of low
neutron absorption, high solubility of uranium and thorium compounds,
chemical inertness at high temperatures, and thermal and radiation sta-
bility. The following comparison of the capture cross sections of the alkali
metals reveals that Li? containing 0.019, Li% has a cross section at 0.0795 ev
and 1150°F that is a factor of 4 lower than that of sodium, which also has
a relatively low cross section:

Element Cross section, barns
Li? (containing 0.019; Li®) 0.073
Sodium 0.290
Potassium 1.13
Rubidium 0.401
Cesium 29

The capture cross section of beryllium is also satisfactorily low at all
neutron energies, and therefore mixtures of Lil and BeFg, which have
satisfactory melting points, viscosities, and solubilities for UF4 and ThE 4,
were selected for investigation in the reactor physics study.

Mixtures of NaF, ZrF4, and UF4 were studied previously, and such a
fuel was successfully used in the Aircraft Reactor Iixperiment (see Chap-
ters 12 and 16). Inconel was shown to be reasonably resistant to corrosion
by this mixture at- 1500°F, and there is reason to expect that Inconel
equipment would have a life of at least several years at 1200°F. As a fuel
for a central-station power reactor, however, the Nal'-ZrF4 system has
several serious disadvantages. The sodium capture cross section is less
favorable than that of Li’. More important, recent data [1] indicate that
the capture cross section of zirconium is quite high in the epithermal and
intermediate neutron energy ranges. In comparison with the Lil'-BeFq
system, the Nal'-Zrl, system has inferior heat-transfer characteristics.

NUCLEAR ASPECTS OF MOLTEN-SALT REACTORS 627

Finally, the INOR alloys (see Chapter 13) show promise of being as resistant
to the beryllium salts as to the zirconium salts, and therefore there is no
compelling reason for selecting the Nal-ZrF4 system.

Reactor calculations were performed by means of the Univac* program
Ocusol [2], a modification of the Eyewash program [3], and the Oracle?
program Sorghum. Ocusol is a 31-group, multiregion, spherically symmet-
rie, age-diffusion code. The group-averaged cross sections for the various
elements of interest that were used were based on the latest available data
[4]. Where data were lacking, reasonable interpolations based on resonance
theory were made. The estimated cross sections were made to agree with
measured resonance integrals where available. Saturation and Doppler
broadening of the resonances in thorium as a function of concentration
were estimated. Inelastic scattering in thorium and fluorine was taken
into account crudely by adjusting the value of £0; however, the Ocusol
code does not provide for group skipping or anisotropy of scattering,

Sorghum is a 31-group, two-region, zero-dimensional, burnout code.
The group-diffusion equations were integrated over the core to remove
the spatial dependency. The spectrum was computed, in terms of a
space-averaged group flux, from group scattering and leakage parameters
taken from an Ocusol calculation. A critical calculation requires about
1 min on the Oracle; changes in concentration of 14 elements during a
specified time can then be computed in about 1 sec. The major assumption
volved 1s that the group scattering and leakage probabilities do not
change appreciably with changes in core composition as burnup progresses.
This assumption has been verified to a satisfactory degree of approximation.

The molten salts may be used as homogeneous moderators or simply as
fuel carriers in heterogeneous reactors. Although, as discussed below,
graphite-moderated heterogeneous reactors have certain potential advan-
tages, their technical feasibility depends upon the compatibility of fuel,
graphite, and metal, which has not as yet been established. For this rea-
son, the homogeneous reactors, although inferior in nuclear performance,
have been given greatest attention.

A preliminary study indicated that if the integrity of the core vessel
could be guaranteed, the nuclear economy of two-region reactors would
probably be superior to that of bare and reflected one-region reactors. The
two-region reactors were, accordingly, studied in detail. Although entrance
and exit conditions dictate other than a spherical shape, it was necessary,
for the calculations, to use a model comprising the following concentric

spherical regions: (1) the core, (2) an INOR-8 core vessel 1/3 in. thick,
(3) a blanket approximately 2 ft thick, and (4) an INOR-8 reactor vessel
2/3 in, thick. The diameter of the core and the concentration of thorium
in the core were selected as independent variables. The primary dependent
variables were the critical concentration of the fuel (U235 U233 or Pu?39),
and the distribution of the neutron absorptions among the various atomic
species in the reactor. Irom these, the critical mass, critical inventory,
regeneration ratio, burnup rate, ete. can be readily calculated, as described
in the following section.

14-1. HomogENEOUS REACTORS FUELED with U235

While the isotope U?32 would be a superior fuel in molten fluoride-salt
reactors (see Section 14-2), it is unfortunately not available in quantity.
Any realistic appraisal of the immediate capabilities of these reactors must
be based on the use of U235,

The study of homogeneous reactors was divided into two phases: (1) the
mapping of the nuclear characteristics of the initial (i.e., “clean’) states
as a function of core diameter and thorium concentration, and (2) the
analysis of the subsequent performance of selected initial states with
various processing schemes and rates. The detailed results of these studies
are given in the following paragraphs. Briefly, it was found that regenera-
tion ratios of up to 0.65 can be obtained with moderate investment in U23%
(less than 1000 kg) and that, if the fission products are removed (Article
14-1.2) at a rate such that the equilibrium inventory is equal to one year’s
production, the regeneration ratio can be maintained above 0.5 for at
least 20 years.

14-1.1 Initial states. A complete parametric study of molten fluoride-
salt reactors having diameters in the range of 4 to 10 ft and thorium con-
centrations in the fuel ranging from 0 to 1 mole 9, ThF4 was performed.
In these reactors, the basic fuel salt (fuel salt No. 1) was a mixture of
31 mole 9, Bel’ and 69 mole 9 Lil", which has a density of about 2.0 g/cc
at 1150°F. The core vessel was composed of INOR-8. The blanket fluid
(blanket salt No. 1) was a mixture of 25 mole 9, ThI"4 and 75 mole 95 Lik,
which has a density of about 4.3 g/cc at 1150°F. In order to shorten the
calculations in this series, the reactor vessel was neglected, since the re-
sultant error was small. These reactors contained no fission products or
nonfissionable isotopes of uranium other than #38,

A summary of the results is presented in Table 14-1, in which the neutron
balance is presented in terms of neutrons absorbed in a given element per
neutron absorbed in U235 (both by fission and the n—y reaction). The
sum of the absorptions is therefore equal to n, the number of neutrons
produced by fission per neutron absorbed in fuel. Further, the sum of the

absorptions in U%%® and thorium in the fuel, and in thorium in the blanket
salt gives directly the regeneration ratio. The losses to other elements are
penalties imposed on the regeneration ratio by these poisons; i.e., if the core
vessel could be constructed of some material with a negligible cross seec-
tion, the regeneration ratio could be increased by the amount listed for
capture in the core vessel.

The Inventories in these reactors depend in part on the volume of the
fuel in the pipes, pumps, and heat exchangers in the external portion of
the fuel circuit. The inventories listed in Table 14-1 are for systems having
a volume of 339 ft? external to the core, which corresponds approximately
to a power level of 600 Mw of heat. In these calculations it was assumed
that the heat was transferred to an intermediate coolant composed of the
fluorides of Li, Be, and Na before being transferred to sodium metal. In
more recent designs (see Chapter 17), this intermediate salt loop has been
replaced by a sodium loop, and the external volumes are somewhat less
because of the improved equipment design and layout.

Critical concentration, mass, inventory, and regeneration ratio. The data
in Table 14-1 are more easily comprehended in the form of graphs, such as
Fig. 14-1, which presents the critical concentration in these reactors as a
function of core diameter and thorium concentration in the fuel salt. The
data points represent calculated values, and the lines are reasonable
interpolations. The maximum concentration calculated, about 35 x 101°

atoms of U?3% per cubic centimeter of fuel salt, or about 1 mole 9, UF,, is
an order of magnitude smaller than the maximum permissible concentra-
tion (about 10 mole 9).

The corresponding eritical masses are graphed in Fig. 14-2. As may be
seen, the critical mass 1s a rather complex function of the diameter and the
thorium concentration. The calculated points are shown here also, and the
solid lines represent, it is felt, reliable interpolations. The dashed lines
were drawn where insufficient numbers of points were calculated to define
the curves precisely; however, they are thought to be qualitatively correct.
Since reactors having diameters less than 6 ft are not economically attrac-
tive, only one case with a 4-ft-diameter core was computed.

The critical masses obtained in this study ranged from 40 to 400 kg of
=. However, the critical inventory in the entire fuel circuit is of more
interest to the reactor designer than is the critical mass. The critical in-
ventories corresponding to an external fuel volume of 339 ft? are therefore

puted from the relation

range from slightly above 100 kg in an 8-ft-diameter core with no thorium
present to 1500 kg in a 5-ft-diameter core with 1 mole 9, ThF4 present.

The optimum combination of core diameter and thorium concentration
i=, qualitatively, that which minimizes the sum of inventory charges (in-
cluding charges on Li7, Be, and Th) and fuel reprocessing costs. The fuel
costs are directly related to the regeneration ratio, and this varies in a
complex manner with inventory of U23% and thorium coneentration, as
shown in Vig. 14-4. It may be seen that at a given thorium concentration,
the regeneration ratio (with one exception) passes through a maximum as
the core diameter 1s varied between 5 and 10 ft. These maxima increase
with increasing thorium concentration, but the inventory values at which
they occur also increase.

Plotting the maximum regeneration ratio versus critical inventory
generates the curve shown in Fig. 14-5. It may be seen that a small in-
vestment in U235 (200 kg) will give a regeneration ratio of 0.58, that 400 kg
will give a ratio of 0.66, and that further increases in fuel inventory have
little effect.

The effects of changes in the compositions of the fuel and blanket salts
are indicated in the following description of the results of a series of calcu-
lations for which salts with more favorable melting points and viscosities
were assumed. The Belz content was raised to 37 mole % in the fuel salt

(fuel salt No. 2), and the blanket composition (blanket salt No. 2) was
fixed at 13 mole % ThF4, 16 mole % BeF3, and 71 mole % LiF. Blanket
salt No. 2 is a somewhat better reflector than No. 1, and fuel salt No. 2 a
somewhat better moderator. As a result, at a given core diameter and
thorium concentration in the fuel salt, both the critical concentration and
the regeneration ratio are somewhat lower for the No. 2 salts,

Reservations concerning the feasibility of constructing and guaranteeing
the integrity of core vessels in large sizes (10 ft and over), together with
preliminary consideration of inventory charges for large systems, led to
the conclusion that a feasible reactor would probably have a core diameter
lying in the range between 6 and 8 ft. Accordingly, a parametric study in
this range with the No. 2 fuel and blanket salts was performed. In this
study the presence of an outer reactor vessel consisting of 2/3 in. of
INOR-8 was taken into account. The results are presented in Table 14-2
and Figs. 14-6 and 14-7. In general, the nuclear performance is somewhat
better with the No. 2 salt than with the No. 1 salt.

Neutron balances and miscellaneous details. The distributions of the
neutron captures are given in Tables 14-1 and 14-2, where the relative
hardness of the neutron spectrum is indicated by the median fission energies
and the percentages of thermal fissions. It may be seen that losses to Li,
Be, and F in the fuel salt and to the core vessel are substantial, especially
in the more thermal reactors (e.g., Case No. 18). However, in the thermal
reactors, losses by radiative capture in U235 are relatively low. Increasing
the hardness decreases losses to salt and core vessel sharply (Case No. 5),
but increases the loss to the n—y reaction. It is these opposing trends
which account for the complicated relation between regeneration ratio and
critical inventory exhibited in Figs. 144 and 14-7. The numbers given
for capture in the Li and F in the blanket show that these elements are well
shielded by the thorium in the blanket, and the leakage values show that
leakage from the reactor is less than 0.01 neutron per neutron absorbed in
1235 in reactors over 6 ft in diameter. The blanket contributes sub-
stantially to the regeneration of fuel, accounting for not less than one-third
of the total even in the 10-ft-diameter core containing 1 mole 9% ThFs.

Effect of substitution of sodium for Li”. In the event that Li? should prove
not to be available in quantity, it would be possible to operate the reactor
with mixtures of sodium and beryllium fluorides as the basic fuel salt. The
penalty imposed by sodium in terms of critical inventory and regeneration
ratio is shown in Fig. 14-8, where typical Na-Be systems are compared
with the corresponding Li-Be systems. With no thorium in the core, the
use of sodium increases the critical inventory by a factor of 1.5 (to about
300 kg) and lowers the regeneration ratio by a factor of 2. The regeneration
penalty is less severe, percentagewise, with 1 mole 9, ThF,4 in the fuel
salt; in an 8-ft-diameter core, the inventory rises from 800 kg to 1100 kg

Reactivity coefficients. By means of a series of calculations in which the
thermal base, the core radius, and the density of the fuel salt are varied
independently, the components of the temperature coefficient of reactivity

eter and a thorium concentration of 0.75 mole 9 in the fuel salt at 1150°F.
From the expression

for the temperature coefficient of reactivity of the fuel. In this calculation,
the effects of changes with temperature in Doppler broadening and satura-
tion of the resonances in Th and U?3? were not taken into account. Since
the effective widths of the resonances would be increased at higher tem-
peratures, the thorium would contribute a reactivity decrease and the
[235 an increase. These effects are thought to be small, and they tend to
cancel each other.

Heat release in core vessel and blanket. The core vessel of a molten-salt
reactor is heated by gamma radiation emanating from the core and blanket
and from within the core vessel itself. Estimates of the gamma heating can
be obtained by detailed analyses of the type illustrated by Alexander and
Mann [7]. The gamma-ray heating in the core vessel of a reactor with an
8-ft-diameter core and 0.5 mole % ThF4 in the fuel salt has been estimated
to be the following:

Source Heat release rate, w/cm3
Radioactive decay in core 1.4

scattering in core
n—y capture in core vessel 4.
n—y capture in blanket 0.

wr On

Estimates of gamma-ray source strengths can be used to provide a crude
estimate of the gamma-ray current entering the blanket. For the 8-ft-
diameter core, the core contributes 45.3 w of gamma energy per square
centimeter to the blanket, and the core vessel contributes 6.8 w/cm?, which,
multiplied by the surface area of the core vessel, gives a total energy
escape into the blanket of 9.7 Mw. Some of this energy will be reflected
into the core, of course, and some will escape from the reactor vessel, and
644 NUCLEAR ASPECTS OF MOLTEN-SALT REACTORS [cHAP. 14

therefore the value of 9.7 Mw is an upper limit. To this may be added the
heat released by capture of neutrons in the blanket. From the Ocusol-A
calculation for the 8-ft-diameter core and a fuel salt containing 0.5 mole %
ThF4 it was found that 0.176 of the neutrons would be captured in the
blanket. If an energy release of 7 Mev /capture is assumed, the heat release
at a power level of 600 Mw (heat) is estimated to be 8.6 Mw. The total is
thus 18.3 Mw or, say, 204+ 5 Mw, to allow for errors.

No allowance was made for fissions in the blanket. These would add 6
Mw for each 1% of the fissions occurring in the blanket. Thus it appears
that the heat release rate in the blanket might range up to 50 Mw.

14~1.2 Intermediate states. Without reprocessing of fuel salt. The nu-
clear performance of a homogeneous molten-salt reactor changes during
operation at power because of the accumulation of fission products and
nonfissionable isotopes of uranium. It is necessary to add U23% to the fuel
salt to overcome these poisons and, as a result, the neutron spectrum is
hardened and the regeneration ratio decreases because of the accompanying
decrease in 7 for U?3% and the increased competition for neutrons by the
poisons relative to thorium. The accumulation of the superior fuel U233
compensates for these effects only in part. The decline in the regeneration
ratio and the increase in the critical inventory during the first year of
operation of three reactors having 8-ft-diameter cores charged, respectively,
with 0.25, 0.75, and 1 mole 9; ThF'4 are illustrated in Fig. 14-9. The criti-
cal inventory increases by about 300 kg, and the regeneration ratio falls
about 169,. The gross burnup of fuel in the reactor charged with 1 mole 7,
ThF4 and operated at 600 Mw with a load factor of 0.809 amounts to
about 0.73 kg/day. The U235 burnup falls from this value as U233 assumes
part of the load. During the first month of operation, the U2%5 burnup
averages 0.69 kg/day. Overcoming the poisons requires 1.53 kg more and
brings the feed rate to 2.22 kg/day. The initial rate is high because of the
holdup of bred fuel in the form of Pa233. As the concentration of this iso-
tope approaches equilibrium, the U235 feed rate falls rapidly. At the end
of the first year the burnup rate has fallen to 0.62 kg/day and the feed rate
to 1.28 kg/day. At this time U233 contributes about 129, of the fissions.
The reactor contains 893 kg of U235 70 kg of U233, 7 kg of Pu23?, 62 kg
of U236 and 181 kg of fission products. The U23 and the fission products
capture 1.8 and 3.89, of all neutrons and impair the regeneration ratio
by 0.10 units. Details of the inventories and concentrations are given in
Table 14-4.

With reprocessing of fuel salt. If the fission products were allowed to ac-
cumulate indefinitely, the fuel inventory would become prohibitively large
and the neutron economy would become very poor. However, if the fission
products are removed, as described in Chapter 12, at a rate such that the

equilibrium inventory is, for example, equal to the first year’s production,
then the increase in U235 inventory and the decrease in regeneration ratio
are effectively arrested, as shown in Fig. 14-10. The fuel-addition rate
drops immediately from 1.28 to 0.73 kg/day when processing is started.
At the end of two years, the addition rate is down to 0.50 kg/day, and it
continues to decline slowly to 0.39 kg/day after 20 years of operation.
The nonfissionable isotopes of uranium continue to accumulate, of course,
but these are nearly compensated by the ingrowth of U233. As shown in
Fig. 14-10, the inventory of U?23 actually decreases for several years in a
typical case, and then increases only moderately during a lifetime of
20) vears,

The rapid increase in critical inventory of U235 during the first year can
be avoided by partial withdrawl of thorium. In Fig. 14-10 the dashed
lines indicate the course of events when thorium is removed at the rate of
1/900 per day. Burnup reduces the thorium concentration by another

1/4300 per day. The U2% inventory rises to 826 kg and then falls, at the
end of eight months, to 587 kg. At this time, the processing rate is in-
creased to 1/240 per day (eight-month cycle), but the thorium is returned
to the core and the thorium concentration falls thereafter only by burnup.
It may be seen that the U23% inventory creeps up slowly and that the re-
generation ratio falls slowly. The increase in U235 inventory could have
been prevented by withdrawing thorium at a small rate; however, the re-
generation ratio would have fallen somewhat more rapidly, and more U?235
feed would have been required to compensate for burnup.

14-2. HomoGENEOUs REACTORS FUELED wrTH [233

Uranium-233 is a superior fuel for use in molten fluoride-salt reactors in
almost every respect. The fission cross section in the intermediate range of
neutron energies is greater than the fission cross sections of U23% and
Pu23?, Thus initial critical inventories are less, and less additional fuel is
required to override poisons. Also, the parasitic cross section is sub-
stantially less, and fewer neutrons are lost to radiative capture. Further,
the radiative captures result in the immediate formation of a fertile iso-

tope, U23%. The rate of accumulation of U?3% is orders of magnitude smaller
than with U235 as a fuel, and buildup of Np?37 and Pu23? is negligible.

The mean neutron energy is rather nearer to thermal m these reactors
than it is in the corresponding U?35 cases. Consequently, losses to core
vessel and to core salt tend to be higher. Both losses will be reduced sub-
stantially at higher thorium concentrations.

14-2.1 Initial states. Results from a parametric study of the nuclear
characteristics of two-region, homogeneous, molten fluoride-salt reactors
fueled with U23? are given in Table 14-5. The core diameters considered
range from 3 to 10 ft, and the thorium concentrations range from 0.25 to 1
mole 9. Although the regeneration ratios are less than unity, they are very
good compared with those obtained with U235. With 1 mole 9, ThF4 in
an 8-ft-diameter core, the U23? inventory was only 196 kg, and the re-
generation ratio was 0.91.

The regeneration ratios and fuel inventories of reactors of various diam-
eters containing 0.25 mole 9} thorium and fueled with U235 or U233 gre
compared in Fig. 14-11. The superiority of U?33 is obvious.

and Np237 constant is begun at this time, the inventory of U?33 increases
slowly to 247 kg and the regeneration ratio rises slightly to 0.73 during the
next 19 years. This constitutes a substantial improvement over the per-
formance with U?35,

14-3. HomoGgENEOUS REACTORS FUELED WiTH PLUTONIUM

It may be feasible to burn plutonium in molten fluoride-salt reactors.
The solubility of PuF3 in mixtures of LiF and BeFs is considerably less
than that of UF4, but is reported to be over 0.2 mole % [8], which may be
sufficient for criticality even in the presence of fission fragments and non-
fissionable isotopes of plutonium but probably limits severely the amount
of ThF4 that can be added to the fuel salt. This limitation, coupled with
the condition that Pu?3? is an inferior fuel in intermediate reactors, will
result in a poor neutron economy in comparison with that of U233-fueled
reactors. However, the advantages of handling plutonium in a fluid fuel
system may make the plutonium-fueled molten-salt reactor more desirable
than other possible plutonium-burning systems.

14-3.1 Initial states. Critical concentration, mass, inventory, and regen-
eration ratto. The results of calculations of a plutonium-fueled reactor
having a core diameter of 8 ft and no thorium in the fuel salt are described
below. The critical concentration was 0.013 mole % PuF3, which is an
order of magnitude smaller than the solubility limits in the fluoride salts
of interest. The critical mass was 13.7 kg and the critical inventory in a
600-Mw system (339 ft3 of external fuel volume) was only 31.2 kg.

The core was surrounded by the Li-Be-Th fluoride blanket mixture
No. 2 (13% ThF4). Slightly more than 19% of all neutrons were captured
in the thorium to give a regeneration ratio of 0.35. By employing smaller
cores and larger investments in Pu?3® however, it should be possible to
increase the regeneration ratio substantially.

Neutron balance and miscellaneous details. Details of the neutron economy
of a reactor fueled with plutonium are given in Table 14-7. Parasitic cap-
tures in Pu??? are relatively high; n is 1.84, compared with a » of 2.9. The
neutron spectrum is relatively soft; almost 60% of all fissions are caused
by thermal neutrons and, as a result, absorptions in lithium are high.

14-3.2 Intermediate states. On the basis of the average value of a of
Pu239 it is estimated that Pu?40 will accumulate in the system until it cap-
tures, at equilibrium, about half as many neutrons as Pu? While these
captures are not wholly parasitic, inasmuch as the product, Pu?%!, is
fissionable, the added competition for neutrons will necessitate an increase
in the concentration of the Pu?3?. Likewise, the ingrowth of fission products
14-4] HETEROGENEOUS GRAPHITE-MODERATED REACTORS 657

will necessitate the addition of more Pu?3®. Further, the rare earths among
the fission products may exert a common-ion influence on the plutonium
and reduce its solubility. On the credit side, however, is the U233 produced
in the blanket. If this is added to the core it may compensate for the in-
growth of Pu? and reduce the Pu?" requirement to below the solubility
limit, and it may be possible to operate indefinitely, as with the U235-
fueled reactors.

14-4. HETEROGENEOUS GRAPHITE-MODERATED REACTORS

The use of a moderator in a heterogeneous lattice with molten-salt
fuels is potentially advantageous. First, the approach to a thermal neutron
spectrum improves the neutron yield, 5, attainable, especially with U233

and Pu®?”. Second, in a heterogeneous system, the fuel is partially shielded
from neutrons of intermediate energy, and a further improvement in ef-
fective neutron yield, n, results. Further, the optimum systems may prove
to have smaller volumes of fuel in the core than the corresponding fluorine-
moderated, homogeneous reactors and, consequently, higher concentrations
of fuel and thorium in the melt. This may substantially reduce parasitic
losses to components of the carrier salt. On the other hand, these higher
concentrations tend to increase the inventory in the circulating-fucl
system external to the core. The same considerations apply to fission prod-
ucts and to nonfissionable isotopes of uranium.

Possible moderators for molten-salt reactors include beryllium, BeO),
and graphite. The design and performance of the Aircraft Reactor Experi-
ment, a beryllium-oxide moderated, sodium-zirconium fluoride salt, one-
region, U*7-fueled burner reactor has been reported (see Chapter 16).
Since beryllium and BeO and molten salts are not chemically compatible,
it wax necessary to line the fuel circuit with Inconel. Tt is easily estimated
that the presence of Inconel, or any other prospective containment metal
in a heterogeneous thermal reactor would seriously impair the regeneration
ratio of a converter-breeder. Consequently, beryllium and BeO are elimi-
nated from consideration.

Preliminary evidence indicates that uranium-bearing molten salts may
be compatible with some grades of graphite and that the presence of the
graphite will not carburize metallic portions of the fuel circuit seriously [9].
It therefore becomes of interest to explore the capabilities of the graphite-
moderated systems. The principal independent variables of interest are
the core diameter, fuel channel diameter, lattice spacing, and thorium
concentration,

actors have been calculated for the same geometry and graphite-to-fluid
volume ratio as those for the reference-design LMFR [10]. The results for
these two cases, together with those for the quid bismuth case, are sum-
marized in Table 14-8. Only the initial states are considered, and a metallie
shell to separate core and blanket fluids has not been included. With no
thorium in the core fluid, the molten-salt-fucled reactor has a significantly
lower regeneration ratio than that of the liquid-metal-fueled reactor, with
only a slightly lower critical mass, Adding 2.5 mole ¢ ThF, to the core
fluid increases the initial regeneration ratio to about 1.07, with a critical
mass and a corresponding total fuel inventory that are acceptably low.
