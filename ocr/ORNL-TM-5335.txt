TWO MOLTEN-FLUORIDE SALTS: LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, AND
EUTECTIC NaBF,-NaF

M. D. Silverman W. R. Huntley H. E. Robertson

ABSTRACT

Heat transfer coefficients were determined experimentally
for two molten-fluoride salts [LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, (72-16-12-0.3
mole 7%) and NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole 7%)] proposed as the fuel salt
and coolant salt, respectively, for molten-salt breeder reactors.
Information was obtained over a wide range of variables, with
salt flowing through 12.7-mm-OD (0.5-in.) Hastelloy N tubing
in a forced convection loop (FCL-2b).

Satisfactory agreement with the empirical Sieder-Tate
correlation was obtained in the fully developed turbulent re-
gion at Reynolds moduli above 15,000 and with a modified Hausen
equation in the extended transition region (Re “v2100-15,000).
Insufficient data were obtained in the laminar region to allow
any conclusions to be drawn. These results indicate that the
proposed salts behave as normal heat transfer fluids with an
extended transition region.

Key words: Heat transfer, molten-fluoride salts, sodium
fluoroborate, forced convection, transition flow regime, tur-
bulent flow.

INTRODUCTION

The heat transfer properties of various molten-salt mixtures are
needed for designing certain components for molten-salt breeder reactors
(MSBRs). Previous investigations have demonstrated that molten salts
usually behave like normal fluids; !™3 however, nonwetting of metallic
surfaces or the formation of low-conductance surface films can occur,”
indicating that heat transfer measurements for specific reactor salts are
necessary. A forced convection loop (FCL-2b), designed primarily for
corrosion testing, was used initially to obtain heat transfer information
on a proposed NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole 7%) coolant salt. More recently, tests
were made in the same loop with a proposed fuel-salt mixture [LiF-BeF;,-

ThF,-UFy (72-16-12~0.3 mole %)].

Heat transfer coefficients were obtained for a wide range of vari-

ables (see Table 1) for both salts flowing through 12.7-mm-0D (0.5-in.)

EXPERIMENTAL

Forced convection loop MSR-FCL-2b, designed primarily for corrosion

testing,’ was used for these experiments. The loop (Fig. 1) is constructed

of 12.7-mm-0D (0.5-in.), 1.09-mm-wall (0.043-in.) commercial Hastelloy N

tubing and contains three corrosion test specimen assemblies exposed to the

circulating salt at three different temperatures and bulk flow velocities

of 1.3 (4.3) and 2.5 m/sec (8.2 fps). Two independently controlled

resistance-heated sections and two finned-tube coolers provide a tempera-
ture differential of "166°C (300°F) at the normal flow rate of 2.5 Xx 107"
m3/sec (8.8 x 1073 ft%/sec). Resistance heating (I°R heaters) is supplied
by a four-lug system, with voltage potential applied to the two center
lugs while the two exterior lugs are at ground potential (Fig. 2). Thus,
there is an unheated section at the center lugs. Because the electrical
resistance of the molten salt is very high compared with that of the metal
tubing (whose resistance remains almost constant over the temperature
range of these experiments), this method of heating is well adapted to the
system. One resistance-heated section (the heat transfer test section,
designated No. 2) contains an actively heated length of 3.5 m (11.5 ft),
resulting in an L/D ratio of 331 and a heat transfer area of 0.115 m?
(1.08 ft2). Guard heaters (clamshells) are located on the heater lugs and
along the resistance-heated tube to make up heat losses during the heat
transfer runs (Fig. 3). Figure 4 shows the test loop with all heaters,
thermocouples, and thermal insulation installed.

The temperature of the bulk fluid is measured by three thermocouples
located in wells at the inlet and the exit of the test section. Wall
temperatures along the heated section are measured by 12 sheathed,
insulated-junction, 1.02-mm-OD (0.040-in.) Chromel-Alumel precalibrated
thermocouples that are wrapped 180° circumferentially around the tubing
and clamped against the wall at about 0.30-m (1-ft) intervals. Thermo-
couple readings during the experiments are recorded automatically by the
Dextir, a central digital data-acquisition system with an accuracy of
$0.10% of full scale and a resolution of 1 part in 10,000.

The actual dimensions of the tubing in resistance-heated section 2
were determined before installation. The tubing outside diameter, mea-
sured by conventional outside micrometers, averaged 12.68 mm (0.499 in.);
the tube wall thickness, measured with an ultrasonic Vidigage, averaged
1.09 mm (0.043 in.). Therefore, the tube internal diameter at room tem-
perature was calculated to be 10.49 mm (0.413 in.), and this value was
used in all subsequent heat transfer calculations.

A variable-speed drive motor on the pump (Fig. 5) controls the salt

flow rate. In the fuel-salt experiments the pump speed was varied from

1000 to 4700 rpm, yielding flow rates of 40 to 250 ml/sec, which corre-
sponds to a Reynolds modulus (Np, ) of 1542 to 14,200. The lower flow
limit was set to avoid salt freezing, whereas the upper limit was dictated
by the horsepower required for driving the pump. Tests with the coolant
salt were done at pump speeds up to 5300 rpm, since this salt is less
dense and requires less pumping power for a given flow rate.

Initially, a series of heat loss measurements was made with no salt
in the loop in order to determine correct guard heater settings to be used
in the heat transfer experiments. In these tests, the power input to the
guard heaters was varied and subsequently plotted vs the average tempera-
ture obtained from readings of the 12 thermocouples (A—L) on the surface
of the loop piping. These data then were used to demonstrate the error
in surface-mounted thermocouple readings in a subsequent test where the
guard heaters were not energized and salt flow was V2.5 x 10~* m3¥/sec.

For example, in run 1 (Fig 6) (line YY), 1250 W was the power input to the
guard heaters; the average temperatures of the bulk fluid obtained from
the three thermocouples in the inlet and outlet wells were 663°C (1225°F)
and 665°C (1129°F), respectively. The average of all the 12 thermocouple
readings (A—L) from the surface of the loop piping was 664°C, indicating
good agreement with the bulk fluid temperature. In run 2 (line XX), no
power was applied to the guard heaters; the bulk fluid temperatures ob-
tained from the three thermocouples in the wells at the inlet and exit
averaged 748°C and 750°C (1382°F), respectively. However, the 12 surface
thermocouples yielded an average temperature of only 732°C, indicating a
wall temperature error of approximately 17°C (31°F) without the guard
heaters. In all experiments, power input to the guard heaters was ad-
justed to balance any heat loss from the test section.

In each experiment, after power was supplied to the I%R heaters,
steady-state conditions were established (with appropriate guard heater
wattage) before taking readings of the loop operating parameters [i.e.,
inlet and outlet temperatures, wall temperatures, power input to the
guard heaters, pump speed, and resistance heating wattage (the latter
measured by calibrated precision wattmeters having an accuracy of *0.25%)].
Two sets of readings, taken at least 10 min apart, were recorded for each

data point. The data for a typical experiment (Fig. 7) show the wall

temperatures recorded by the surface thermocouples at the appropriate
locations. There is a slight drop in wall temperature between the F and
G locations (Fig. 2) which is probably caused by an increased film coeffi-
cient due to turbulence from weld penetrations at the lugs (F is located
150 mm upstream of the center power lugs and G is 150 mm downstream).
However, the bulk fluid temperature at any location along the piping was
assumed to rise linearly by drawing a line connecting points X and Y,
which were the temperatures obtained by averaging the three thermocouple
readings from the inlet and outlet thermocouple wells, respectively.

Initially, there was concern that the sheathed thermocouples strapped
against the tube wall surface might not measure the surface temperature
accurately because they were not bonded to the wall. Therefore, four
0.25-mm-0D (0.010-in.) bare-wire thermocouples were spot welded to the
heated tube wall for comparison purposes. These four thermocouples were
read with a potentiometer, while the sheathed thermocouples were recorded
by the Dextir. Special test runs were made with the guard heaters both
on and off to observe the performance of the two types of thermocouples
at surface temperatures ranging from 444 to 605°C. With the guard heaters
set at the proper level to make up heat losses, the sheathed thermocouples
read randomly higher than the bare-wire thermocouples by 0.6 to 3.9°C.
Without guard heat, the sheathed thermocouples read randomly lower by 0.3
to 3.9°C. It was concluded from these measurements that the sheathed
thermocouple readings were sufficiently accurate for our tests.

The physical properties of the fuel salt and coolant salt®® used in
these experiments are listed in Tables 2 and 3, chemical analyses are given

in Table 4, and properties of the Hastelloy N alloy’ are shown in Table 5.

DATA AND CALCULATIONS

Nine heat transfer tests were made with the coolant salt and twenty-
one with the fuel salt. The data from these experiments, along with the
necessary physical constants, were used to calculate the dimensionless
parameters such as the Reynolds, Prandtl, and Nusselt numbers by the
following procedure. Initially, the inside wall temperature of the tube

at each thermocouple location was obtained from the measured outside wall

where r, and r, are the outside and inside radius of the tube, respec-
tively; t, and ts are the outside (surface) and inside wall temperatures;
L is the test-section length of tubing; ky is the thermal conductivity of
the Hastelloy N tubing at the corresponding outside wall temperature; and
q is the rate of heat transfer to the fluid.

The temperature drop through the fluid film was then obtained by
subtracting the temperature of the bulk fluid (estimated from the linear-
type plot shown in Fig. 7) from the inside wall temperature.

Local heat transfer coefficients were calculated from the experimental
data by employing the equation for convective heat transfer by forced flow

in tubes,

Selected data, along with the calculated parameters, are summarized
in Tables 6 and 7. The calculations involve several assumptions made in
the treatment of the data. The straight line drawn between the mean inlet

and outlet fluid temperatures (thermocouple well readings, e.g., Fig. 7)

assumes constant physical properties for the salt and uniform heat transfer
over the inner surface of the test section. This treatment is supported by
the essentially constant heat capacity of both liquid salts in the experi-
mental temperature range and the relatively constant resistance of the

Hastelloy N test section (<1% variation).

ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

Although there is not complete agreement in the literature, the follow-
ing standard heat transfer correlations are well accepted and have been
used in comparing our results.

These correlations for both salts along with the experimental values are
plotted in Figs. 8 and 9 using all thermocouple readings along the entire
length of resistance-heated section 2. Because the heat flux was inter-
rupted at the center lugs, a maximum L/D of 167 was used in the treatment
of these data. These results are quite similar, although the physical
properties of the coolant salt (Table 2) differ enough from those of the

fuel salt to provide a higher Nee range.

Conversely, at the exit, the guard heater input is low, causing low thermo-
couple readings and high Nop values. Consequently, the best data should
be those obtained from the thermocouple readings near the center of the

test section. However, it was noted the Ny results just downstream of

the center lugs were abnormally high. The reason for this, which was dis-
covered during inspection of the loop piping after the heat transfer runs
were completed, was excessive penetration of the butt welds where the lugs
joined the tubing. This disrupted the inner surface of the flow channel
and undoubtedly caused turbulence, with better downstream heat transfer.
Thus, it was concluded that the best data should be those obtained from
the E and F thermocouple locations [1.30 m (4.25 ft) and 1.60 m (5.25 ft)
downstream from the inlet]. Therefore these data points for both salts
are replotted with the standard correlations in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11.

There is satisfactory agreement with the Sieder-Tate correlation in
the fully developed turbulent region at Reynolds moduli above 15,000.

Between Reynolds moduli of "2100 and 15,000, the experimental data agree

very well with the modified? Hausen!? equation, which is normally appli-
cable to the transition region. The extended transition region is prob-
ably due to the high viscosity and large negative temperature coefficient
of viscosity of the fuel salt. It is known from hydrodynamic stability
that heat transfer from a solid interface to a fluid whose viscosity de-
creases with temperature can produce this effect. As noted earlier,
freezing of the salt at low velocities limited the data obtainable at
low Reynolds moduli. These data at the upper limit of the laminar flow
region are too meager to allow any conclusions to be drawn.

The results of these experiments are similar for both salts and indi-
cate that the proposed coolant and fuel salts behave as normal heat trans-

fer fluids with a somewhat extended transition region.

CONCLUSIONS

The heat transfer performance of a proposed MSBR coolant salt [NaBFy-
NaF (92-8 mole %)] and a fuel salt [LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, (72-16-12-0.3 mole
%)] was measured in forced convection loop FCL-2b. Satisfactory agreement
with the empirical Sieder-Tate correlation was observed in the fully de-

veloped turbulent region at Reynolds moduli above 15,000. Between Reynolds
24

moduli of "2100 and 15,000, the experimental data follows a modified Hausen

equation which is normally applicable to the transition region. The ex-~

tended transition region is probably due to the high viscosity and large

negative temperature coefficient of viscosity of the salts. Insufficient

data were taken in the laminar region to allow any conclusions to be drawn.

The results of these experiments are similar for both salts and indicate

that the proposed salts behave as normal heat transfer fluids with an ex-

tended transition region.
