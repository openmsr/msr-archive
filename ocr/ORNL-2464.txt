ABSTRACT

 

A study of a high-level-activity hot cell for the major dissection of the ART was made. Such
dissection was necessary to obtain metallurgical and design data on which future high-performance
reactors might be based. The study included severing and removing the reactor from the test cell
after operation, a procedure for a component removal sequence, and a proposed disassembly build-
ing facility.

Evaluations of handling, measuring, and cutting techniques for remote work are presented. Al-
though these are based on limited experimental work, progress is adequate to indicate their poten-
tial value for any high-level reactors which must be handled after irradiation. In many cases details
of the work in the form of the original report have been included in the Appendix.

With the termination of the ART project in September 1957, the draft for what was to have been
a status report was revised to become this termination report. Thus, the plans and experimental

work are recorded for those who may find the information useful on similar problems.

 
 

ART REMOVAL AND DISASSEMBLY

1. INTRODUCTION

The major effort of the ANP program at ORNL was
directed toward the construction and operation of a
reactor known as the Aircraft Reactor Test (ART).
It was expected that much information would be de-
rived during the scheduled 1000-hr test period.
However, there were many items which could not be
learned except by disassembly and careful analysis
of the reactor itself after the completion of the oper-
ating period. With the recent decision not to com-
plete and operate the reactor, actual performance
and test data will not be available, but the detailed
planning carried out for the disassembly of this re-
actor should provide a sound basis for any com
parable reactor.

Because of the unusual performance requirements,
the ART was to operate with power densities many
times higher than had heretofore been obtained.
Weight limitations for aircraft reactors require a
highly refined design in which many of the parts
may undergo plastic deformation during operation.
While predictions of the conditions of the ART re-
actor parts have been made, based upon careful
analysis of a long series of experiments on a
smaller scale, it is not possible to duplicate all of
the operating conditions simultaneously prior to
running the reactor. Thus it was extremely im-
portant that a fairly complete disassembly and post-
mortem examination be conducted on the reactor to
determine how well it withstood the test conditions.
Therefore, the disassembly, inspection, and precise
measurement of the parts, coupled with complete
metallographic examinations, were to be a vital
phase of the over-all experiment.

It was recognized from the inception of the ART
project that disassembly of the reactor would be re-
quired. However, it had been believed that the ART
reactor pit and the hot fuel dump tank pit, plus the
surrounding area in Building 7503, would be ade-
quate and available for the ART reactor as it was
for the ARE disassembly. Accordingly, this phase
of the project work was not pursued immediately, as
an all-out effort was needed to get the ART reactor
components into the production stage and to modify
and prepare the 7503 building so that it would be

 

I.E. Crabtree, Disassembly of the Aircraft Reactor
Experiment, ORNL CF-57-3-56 (Apr. 5, 1957),

suitable for the ART test. Sufficient progress was
made in both of these phases to show clearly that
disassembly of the ART reactor would have been a
very difficult operation and that the existing ARE
pits in Building 7503 were grossly inadequate.

In extrapolating experience gained in the disas-
sembly of the ARE, the differences in proposed
power level and operating time for the ART were
taken into account. The ARE was operated for a
total of 100 Mwhr, whereas the ART was scheduled
to operate for a total of 30,000 Mwhr. This increase
by a factor of 300 in the total irradiation of the re-
actor components meant vastly increased difficulty
in disassembly. Since the bulk of the radioactivity
100 days or more after shutdown would be from long-
lived isotopes, the radioactivity would be directly
proportional to the number of megawatt-hours that
the reactor was operated. Whereas disassembly of
the ARE was possible in the Building 7503 pits by
using improvised methods and ‘‘long-handled tools’
from above with roof plugs removed (see Fig. 1), the
operation was marginal and certainly could not have
been repeated for disassembly of a reactor having a
radiation level 300 times greater. Both the shield-
ing and dusting problems would have made it pro-
hibitive.

The ARE reactor was a relatively simple piece of
equipment, consisting of six sets of parallel-flow
pipe runs, each formed into a serpentine shape with
a series of U-bends arranged with headers at either
end, surrounded by the solid moderator and all con-
tained within a welded tank. Disassembly of this
unit was accomplished by removing the end plates
and pipe header manifolds, cutting the U-bends from
one end, and pulling all remaining pipe from the re-
actor container. However, the ART reactor (Fig. 2)
is a complex piece of machinery which is best de-
scribed as a multilayer pressure vessel because of
its multiplicity of precision-made shells, or casings,
which either direct the flow of the fuel or encase
such components as the reflector-moderator, the
boron carbide shield, and the several sodium pas-
sages required for internal cooling. Atop the reactor
is the north head, consisting of a series of pre-
cision-built labyrinth-type channels. Heat ex-
changers built to close-tolerance specifications
were to be located within the fuel-channel layers of
the vessel and within the north head. Because of
the numerous precision-built parts in this reactor, it

was known that both the assembly process and the
disassembly operation would be difficult and te-
dious.

Since the ARE reactor was essentially a plumbing
system, the principal types of information sought by
disassembly were those obtainable from chemical
and metallurgical studies. Since the unit was rela-
tively simple and operated at very low stress levels,
there was no need for accurate physical measure-
ments to determine dimensional changes resulting
from its operation. However, the ART reactor is de-
signed very closely; in fact many parts were ex-
pected to deform no more than 0.2% during the start-
up and off-design-point operations. Many non-
nuclear tests, such as the ETU, were planned to
prove the design insofar as possible, but without
nuclear heat the actual temperature distribution can-
not be exactly duplicated. Therefore precise
physical measurements were to be taken after oper-
ation to confirm many of the decisions made during
the design, assembly, and operation of the machine.
For these reasons, the requirements for postoper-
ation measurements and samples for chemical and
metallurgical studies were numerous.

Accordingly, approximately a year ago a concerted
effort by the ANP Project was started to examine
the problems of ART reactor removal and disas-
sembly. Although the experience gained from the
ARE disassembly was available, the fact remains
that neither the Oak Ridge National Laboratory nor
any other USAEC installation has performed a
thorough dissection of a radioactive reactor to
obtain information such as that required for the
ART.

Therefore the objective of developing a program
for safe removal and disassembly of the ART con-
stituted something of a pioneering effort in a new
field. Significant progress was made; however,
much of the work is preliminary. Even so, it was
deemed advisable to bring together in one report the
results of work accomplished. This is a termination
report designed to present the plans, methods, and
information as tentatively developed.

Not only has preparation of the report provided the
authors another opportunity to evaluate the numerous
facets of the program, but its study by reviewers
should stimulate development of program improve-
ments and application of this information to other

reactor studies. The authors, therefore, solicit com-
ments and suggestions from readers. »

In general, the investigations have been divided
into the following categories:

1. Removal: disengagement, withdrawal, and
transportation of the radioactive reactor and com-
ponents from the Building 7503 operations cell to
the disassembly hot cell

2. Disassembly: dismantling of the radioactive
reactor and components in a hot cell plus obtaining
the required postoperation specimens and infor-
mation

3. Special studies: shielding studies, particle
size distribution, cutting methods evaluations,
sealing systems, replication and measuring tech-
niques, and scale models

4. Hot cell facility: the physical plant, including
dismantling hot cell, service and maintenance hot
cell, hot storage, and basic equipment as required
for the disassembly operations “

Before the detailed discussions under the above
headings, a discussion of criteria has been included
to make the program objectives more definitive. For
completeness, a brief review of tentative schedules
and budget considerations is presented at the end of
the report. A considerable portion of the material
has been included in the Appendix in order to permit
presentation of the information in detail without dis-
turbing the continuity of the report.

While the development of handling methods, meas-
urement techniques, and cutting processes has been
directed toward a specific reactor, namely, the ART,
it is believed that many of the features are appli-
cable to the dismantling of other large reactors.
Certainly the basic schemes may be adapted to
other disassembly situations, Experience has in-
dicated that each new advance in technology re-
quires a corresponding advance in its associated
facilities. Thus, the highly radioactive reactor
equipment requires specialized methods capable of
safely handling the physical units. The necessity .
for working through remote devices increases the
difficulties by a large factor. lt is realized that
practically all new reactors will be faced with
similar problems, and any solutions which are de-
veloped during this work should find application in
reactors which follow.

 

 
2, OBJECTIVES AND CRITERIA
Information Required

The major types of information required from dis-
assembly of the ART were:

1. information and dimensional data on the effects
that power operation of the reactor has upon the
structural stability, distortion, warping, crack-
ing, and local behavior in the vicinity of welds,
brazed joints, etc., of all major reactor compo-
nents,

2. chemical analyses of samples of the reactor
parts to determine whether significant reactions
occurred during operation;

3. metallurgical study of specimens from each
region and each major part of the reactor to as-
certain the extent of plating-out of fission
products, if any occurred, and to determine what
changes were brought about by the unique oper-
ation of radiation, temperature, fuel circulating
velocities, pressure, and corrosion;

4. material studies to ascertain the compatibility
of beryllium and Inconel, the integrity of a boron
carbide shield layer and its cladding, and the
effects of radiation damage on various metals,
particularly those associated with the boron
carbide layer;

3. in the event of a failure of any part during oper-
ation, study of the exact conditions at the point
of failure.

The first step after the formation of the ART Dis-
assembly Group was to establish in precise termi-
nology exactly what was required from the disas-
sembly that would satisfy the above general require-
ments.2 A compilation of the resulting details can
be seen in Appendix A. A study of the ‘‘before’’
and “‘after’’ measurements required for creep defor-
mation revealed that simpler methods of getting this
data could be devised, as will be explained later.

Problems Considered

Accordingly, steps were taken to identify all
problems and circumstances which would exist or
might arise that would have a definite bearing on
the disassembly operations. Therefore, in an effort
to establish an early set of design criteria, a report
entitled Outline of ART Disassembly Problems was
prepared and discussed with all parties who were to

Disassembly, ORNL CF-57-4-31 (Apr. 12, 1957).

 

be concerned with this project. This report is pre-
sented herein as Appendix B.

At this stage it was recognized that the ART Dis-
assembly Group could progress faster if the group
could review its work and problems frequently with
Project management as well as others concerned.
Accordingly, a ‘‘Disassembly Planning Meeting’’
was organized on a semiformal basis. In the weekly
meetings during late 1956, considerable assistance
was obtained through the establishment of several
important criteria, particularly those dealing with
the conditions for which shielding, ventilation, and
accessibility are vital. Minutes of these meetings
are available in the Project records; however, all
technical data have been included in this report in
the appropriate places.

Another major step in the establishment of criteria
was a series of studies of the postpower operations
and shutdown procedures for the ART. From these,
determinations were made of likely starting con-
ditions for removal and disassembly of each com-
ponent. A. P. Fraas® prepared the first report on a
general basis at the outset of the disassembly pro-
gram; W. B. Cottrell* reviewed the problems in
detail late in 1956.

O#f.Gas Leakage

In connection with shielding requirements, a de-
cision was made to establish an arbitrary, though
realistic, radiation source of a certain intensity that
could be used for calculations. Accordingly, an as-
sumption was made that during the operation of the
ART there would occur from the reactor inside the
pressure vessel an ‘‘off-gas’’ leakage of 1%. This
value is considered to be an abnormal one with ref-
erence to a successful and normal operation by the
ART, but it is believed that the use of this figure is
conservative and also provides a safety factor ex-
cept in the case of a major reactor failure. Activity
levels have been calculated for normal reactor oper-
ations and have been reported.’

Removal Methods

The exact method of removing the ART from the
pressure vessel was not determined; however, five

methods or basic types of equipment were analyzed.
The final selection of one of these methods would
have established most of the design criteria asso-
ciated with the ART removal phase of this program.
The five principal methods considered were:

1. radisphere,

flat top or floating floor,

remote C-crane,

rigid polar,

swinging polar.

nA WN

Studies indicated that either the floating floor or
the remote C-crane was likely to be the most
practical method, with the final selection to be made
on the basis of existing activity level, accessi-
bility, and cost.

Disassembly Facility

With regard to the large hot cell facility, design
criteria were established in rough draft form as pro-
posed for submittal to an architect-engineer. The
architect-engineer, in turn, was to prepare the de-
tailed engineering and construction drawings for the
facility. In addition to the problems associated with
space, equipment, maintenance, and basic design of
the large hot cell, two problems that were of par-
ticular concern were contamination and personne!
shielding. The air-borne radioactivity would require
adequate filtering systems and a negative air pres-
sure within the cell in order to keep the operating
area low in activity. Complete circulating, filtering,
and disposal systems were required for all working
solutions, such as cutting fluids, decontaminants,
and wash solutions. Personnel shielding was to be
provided by 4)-fi-thick barytes concrete walls and
shielded viewing windows.

3. REMOVAL

Upon completion of operation of the ART it was
planned that, while the pressure vessel of the 7503
cell was still closed, all the process fluids would
be transferred to their respective removal containers.
The fuel system was to be rinsed, the NaK was to
be removed, and the sodium was to be drained from
all parts of the reactor except the control rod. All
these operations were to be performed by remote
control. After sufficient time for decay of activity
in the fuel, the cell (Fig. 3) was to be unsealed and
cautiously opened. At this stage the program for
disassembly of the ART was to begin.

Philosophy and General Plan for Removal

While successful removal, transport, and disas-
sembly of the ART were to be dependent upon the
radioactivity level of the fuel and equipment, it
must be recognized that the possible activity level
could have been anywhere from very low to very
high. The former represented the case wherein
operational difficulties occurred shortly after nu-
clear operations began, while the latter represented
the extreme case of a near catastrophe, in which
efforts to recover the equipment could yet have been
justified, The normal case was to be that in which
the reactor was successfully operated for 500 hr at
60 Mw without leaks from the off-gas, fuel, NaK, or
sodium systems, and consequently all activity in
the cell would have been successfully contained.
However, for the design case, criteria were assumed
that would represent a situation somewhere between
the normal and subcatastrophe cases. The two
basic situations recognized as causes for trouble- .
some activity were leaks from the off-gas system
and accidents where fuel would get outside the con-
tainers and shields. Either case would require both =
means for controlling or reducing contamination, and
shielding protection for man entry into the cell.

Arbitrarily, it was established that removal design
criteria would not go beyond the case of off-gas
system leaks. Improvised measures would be em-
ployed for worse situations.

To avoid the possibility of contaminated lines at
the manhole and to ensure an early transfer of fuel
to the recovery tank, it was planned to relocate the
control panel for the fuel transfer from the temporary
location on the main floor to the auxiliary equipment
room panel. Also, to eliminate the need for vacuum
distillation of sodium from the reactor, plans were to
permit the sodium in the control rod to freeze, It
was to be removed subsequently from the reactor in
the disassembly hot cell.

To reduce the quantity of sodium within the com-
ponents, the reactor shell sodium and moderator
sodium were to be drained through separate lines to -
a common line having a bismuth valve and then
through the 7503 cell wall to a drain tank in the
radiator pit. It was recognized that residual sodium
would remain in pockets within the reactor.

Because of the possible contamination on all sur-
faces within the cell, it was proposed to wash these
many surfaces down with a portable deluge shower
head. To remove the waste water and to simplify
drainage of the water from shield systems, it was

Fig. 3. Model of the ART. The reactor is shown in the operating cell prior to removal.
planned to install a sump pump that could transfer
water to a safe drainage system,

To facilitate removal of components with remote
equipment, it was proposed that every line that had
to be cut should have an accessible horizontal sec-
tion of pipe. The only exception to this was the
fuel drain line. For this, it was first proposed to
preinstall a severance device; however, later it was
planned to use a portable one. Wherever gas leak-
age from severed pipes appeared likely, a sealing
device such as the ‘’sealant injector’’ was to be
used,

In order to reduce spread of contamination in the
building, it was planned to provide a containment
can into which the fuel recovery tank could be
drawn for the transfer. The can was to be equipped
with a blower and filters to promote convection
cooling of the tank.

For removal and transportation of the hot reactor,
it was proposed to drain the reactor water shield,
lift and carry it through the 7503 building with the
remotely controlled 30-ton building crane, and mount
it on a heavy-duty low-boy trailer. If deemed neces-
sary, the reactor water shield would be refilled for
the trip to the disassembly hot cell.

A compilation of postoperation dose rates as pre-
dicted for the ART is presented in Table 1.

criteria would be based on the off-gas system leak

case, calculations for gamma dose rates and amounts

of beta activity were performed by D. E. Guss of

the Solid State Division. It was assumed that:

1. during the entire operation period 1% of the off-
gas somehow leaked from the off-gas plumbing
system into the 7503 cell,

2, the gaseous fission products which escaped
plated out on the simple geometrical surface of
a 12-ft-radius sphere,

3. the computed dose rate would be based on the
gamma activity of the daughters of these fission
products at 10 days after shutdown following
500 hr of continuous operation at 60 Mw.

For this case the gamma dose rate through a 1-in.
lead shield would be 6 r/hr. The most serious of-
fender in dose would be La'49 with 1% -Mev gamma-
ray energy. Since it is the decay product of 12.8-
day Ba'49 and has a 40-hr half life itself, the dose
rate should fall fairly fast to the next dose-rate
level as the La'4% decays. This new level is a -
dose rate of 600 mr/hr through a l-in. lead shield
approximately 40 days following the shutdown.

The amount of beta activity in the cell 10 days -
after shutdown was calculated to be as follows:
Half Life Curies
13 days 710
20 days 1387
28 years 13
Total 2110

Most of these betas are of 1'-Mev energy and have
a maximum range of 18 ft in air. This amount of
activity would require appropriate protection for
personnel in the vicinity of the open manhole. Since
approximately % cm of Lucite should be sufficient
to stop betas at the manhole location, it was recog-
nized that the gamma dose through the cell top fol-
lowing such an off-gas leak might well be the more
serious problem, It would exist immediately upon
lowering of the annulus water level.

Access into the 7503 Cell :
Five methods were considered for providing ac-
cess and for performing the removal from the pres- .

sure cell, These methods are described below and
are compared in detail in Table 2,

taken in the design of this tool should include dual
controls for the crane (internal and external), radi-
ation monitoring equipment, communication equip-

ment, and an external source of breathing air.

2. Floating Floor. = This device consists of a
ring-shaped float on which a circular floor is placed.
The circular floor contains a rotating disk which has
a slot across the diameter, A vertical tube, which
carries the shear, operates through the slot in the
floor. The shear can be manipulated to any point in
the cell by a combination of rotary and linear travels.
Shielding is provided on the floor and is limited
only by the buoyancy of the float. The device is
locked at any point by flooding the float tank and
letting the floor rest on the pressure cell edge.

3. Remote C-Crane. — The tool used in this tech-
nique is a large horseshoe made of large-diameter
pipe. One end of the horseshoe is suspended from
the 30-ton crane, and the other end is snaked through
the manhole. The in-cell end of the tool has a shear
attached to it which is moved by a combination of
the crane movements and fulcrum location.

4. Rigid Polar. — This method makes use of the
pressure cell crane bridge, to which is attached a
trolley containing a vertical telescoping member
that carries the shear. The telescoping member
would have to have a long travel, 8 to 10 ft, which
may not be practical,

5. Swinging Polar. = In this system the hydraulic
shear is suspended from the hook of the pressure
cell crane and is placed in position by crane move-
ments, A rotation at the hook would have to be
added to the existing equipment; in addition, it
would be necessary to motorize the trolley and to
provide external crane controls,

Of the systems described, the floating floor and
the remote C-crane appear the most attractive.
Final selection was deferred for completion of de-
sign studies. The floating floor method offered
direct visual observation through shield-type win-
dows placed in the floor, while the remote C-crane
would depend upon properly located television
cameras for directing and observing the work. Since
televiewing for removal was considered promising
by some, in a preliminary test with one camera, it
is believed that a satisfactory job could be done in
the cell with three cameras of types that are com-
mercially available, One would be suspended from
the outside edge of the manhole, pointing in the
general direction of the reactor. It would have re-
mote plane, tilt, focus, and lens change, and would

10

watch the over-all operation, Two fixed-lens cam-
eras would travel with the remotely operated tool
carrier and follow the progress of the operation.
One would be mounted on the carrier so as to look
down on the tool; the other would be mounted on the
tool itself so as to look horizontally at the work.

Severing the Reactor for Removal

Choice of methods for severing the reactor free of
its numerous connections was based on the follow-
ing factors:

1. It must sever the connections effectively.

2, It must cause a minimum of contamination.

3. It must require a minimum of time to do the
work,

4, It must lend itself to remote operation.

5. It must require a minimum of maintenance.

6. It must be priced within economic justification.

An evaluation study was made to determine which
cutting method most nearly approached the ideal, as
well as to determine which facets of the ideal must
be relaxed to achieve the desired end result. For
removal from the cell, shearing of pipes, wires, and
instrument lines appeared most desirable because of
the minimal activity spread and the partial closure
effected when the cut was made. Accordingly, it
was decided that severing of large diameter pipe
(3%-in.-ID sched-40 Inconel) in the pressure cell
should be done with a hydraulic guillotine-type
cutter (Fig. 4). The shear has been designed and
built, and tests have demonstrated that it will cut
4-in. pipe satisfactorily. It is hydraulically oper-
ated and is manipulated by the crane. The hydrau-
lic controls provide rotational motion, so that the
tool can be adjusted to the proper cutting angle for
the pipe. Small pipes (%-in.-ID sched-40 Inconel)
would be cut with a ““hook-shear.’”” This device,
which would be smaller for use in close quarters,
has yet to be designed and tested. A logging-type
saw which could be fitted with a band filer has also
been considered for this service. Test work would
be required for an evaluation of this tool.

A special problem was encountered where the fuel
drain line connects the reactor and the dump tank.
It was planned to use the large hydraulic shear,
mounted in the horizontal position, for this cut, A
cartridge-actuated sealant injector (Fig. 5) was

designed’ for sealing the activity within this pipe
before it was severed. Figure 6 shows a cross
section of two concentric pipes into which injection-
type pins were driven with a stud gun in a prelimi-
nary test for the purpose of determining the proper
propelling force for adequate penetration. As indi-
cated in Fig. 5, the concentric pipes would be
crimped prior to injection of the sealant. After the
inner pipe was sealed, the two pipes would then be
severed by means of the guillotine cutter. The
same general scheme, except for different pipe
sizes, would be used for the snow-trap vent lines.
Although development work on this device is incom-
plete, it is believed that this method of sealing
would have prevented the spread of activity from
the severed ends of pipes.

The tool maintenance problems for the severance
devices were expected to vary with the extractability
of the tool system. Dropping of cut lines was con-
sidered as probably acceptable but somewhat un-
desirable. Schemes for eliminating this exist, so it
was not considered a serious problem.

Withdrawal of the Reactor

 

The possibility of the reactor wedging on the sup-
port columns was considered. It was recognized
that for this possible problem, as well as other un-
scheduled difficulties, a foolproof removal tool
such as an extended cutting torch would have to be
available as a contingency tool. Whatever the re-
moval scheme is, special attention would be re-
quired for releasing the reactor stop device.

When all severing of reactor connections was com-
plete, it was planned to lift the reactor by means of

a bail carried by the building crane. This bail was
designed to engage the lifting pins on the support
structure with only visual observation from above.
If activity levels permitted, the crane operator
would work from the crane cab; otherwise, a remote
control cable would be necessary. The crane was
to lift the reactor and carry it to the front of the
building, where it would be placed on the low-boy
carrier. Since the capacity of the building crane is
limited, it was intended to drain the water jacket
for this phase, and then replace the water in the
jacket for the additional shielding it would provide
during transit. Adequate dust covers to prevent the
spread of activity would be applied, and the unit
would then be towed to the hot cell, Suitable
shielding was to be placed between the reactor and
the operator during transit.

4. DISASSEMBLY

Upon arrival of the reactor at the Reactor Dis-
assembly Hot Cell (RDHC), it was to be positioned
in the unloading area under the extended rails for
the hot cell bridge crane. After the water shield
was drained to reduce weight, the reactor was then
to be transferred into the cell. At this stage dis-
section operations were to begin.

The program was to make visual observations,
take physical measurements, make replications,
take photographs, and remove original specimens
as the reactor was dismantled in a carefully planned
sequence. Pieces removed were to be decontami-
nated and conveyed to hot storage for subsequent
dissection and examination or for disposal. |t was
planned that operations performed in the large hot
cell would be limited to large units, while work
on the smaller items would be done in specially
equipped small cells.®

A component disassembly method (the approxi-
mate reverse of the assembly order) was planned to
provide the best accessibility, as well as to yield
the required specimens with minimum distortion.

Disassembly in the Hot Cell

A detailed set of operation planning sheets forms
the nucleus of the disassembly procedure. These

sheets cover a step-by-step analysis of each oper-
ation required to disassemble the ART and are ar-
ranged in a sequence that specifies the cutting
operations, the samples to be obtained, the measure-
ments or observations to be taken, and the tools re-
quired. They also include views of the reactor at
various stages of disassembly, so that the reader
can visualize the operations more easily. It starts
with the arrival of the ART aboard a low-boy at the
main entrance doors of the large hot cell.

For the convenience of the reader in understanding
the procedures which follow, a series of sketches
has been included. Figure 2 shows the reactor in
cross section. Figures 7-9 show the reactor at
various stages of disassembly, and Fig. 10 is a
typical page from the eighty-odd operation sheets
that were developed for the sequential disassembly
work.

By means of the 30-ton hot cell overhead crane,
the support structure with the reactor attached is
picked up from the low-boy and transported into the
disassembly section of the hot cell, where it is
suspended from wall brackets. The water shield -
sections are removed, and the lower NaK manifolds
and the fuel dump lines are severed with a hydraulic
shear. The purpose of this operation is to permit
removal of the south lead shield and to permit at-
tachment of machining fixtures. The south lead and
equatorial lead shield sections are then removed.

The reactor is then moved into the turntable area of
the hot cell, where final machining and trimming of
the south NaK manifolds, the fuel dump lines,
thermocouple stubs, and any other projections on the
bottom of the reactor are performed. Next to be re-
moved is the snow trap, which is suspended from
the support structure. It is followed by the fuel
pumps and sodium pumps, which are removed from
the reactor as individual units. By raising the
turntable, the reactor load is transferred from the
support structure to the turntable, and the support
structure is then removed from the reactor. At this
point the reactor is securely attached to the turn- -
table on a special mounting fixture which readily
permits positioning and alignment of the reactor.

In order to remove the north lead, the north NaK
manifolds are then severed and trimmed. Next, the
four pump barrels are cut off as close as possible
to Shell VII by using a tool similar to an internal
boring bar. The control rod is severed near Shell
Vii, and all other projecting elements from the
north head are machined away to give maximum

access. The sodium expansion tank dome top is
then cut away by abrasive grinding, sawing, or
drilling a series of interlocking holes, followed by
the removal of the wall in a similar fashion, A
series of interlocking holes at a 45° angle from the
horizontal is made around the circumference of the
control rod thimble in the vicinity of Shell VII, the
fuel tank top, and the stack to the fuel tank. In
order to remove the control rod to complete freeing
the north head from Shell VII, both fuel pump barrels
must be disconnected at the weld to Shell VII. There
are also a number of miscellaneous dip lines, ther-
mocouples, etc., which must be disconnected. A
cut with an abrasive grinder around the circumfer-
ence of Shell VII at approximately 1 in. below the
equator completes partial freeing of Shell VII from
the reactor, and the north hemisphere of this shell
may now be lifted off.

With the reactor in this condition, much of the ma-
chining in connection with obtaining specimens and
measurements of the north head assembly may now
be done. When this work is completed, an abrasive
cut may be made through Shell VI at the equator.
This frees the subassembly consisting of Shell VI,
the north head, heat exchangers, and reflector-
moderator, which may be lifted off at this time and
stored for further work. Shells VII and VI are then
severed completely in the blowout patch area, thus
leaving Shell | exposed for examination, specimen
removal, and measurement, Shell | is then removed,
and this exposes the island beryllium and spacers.
The north half of the island beryllium is removed at
this time, and the remaining portion of the reactor
on the turntable is sent to storage.

The subassembly consisting of Shell VI, the north
head, the heat exchangers, and the reflector-moder-
ator assembly is placed in a saddle fixture on the
turntable and clamped down. Pins connecting Shell
V1 and the fuel-to-Nak heat exchangers are then ma-
chined away at 24 places, and a temporary band is
placed around the heat exchangers just below the
lower edge of Shell VI. In order to separate Shell
VI from the subassembly, a cut is made around the
connection of Shell VI to the lower deck and also at
the connection of Shell VI to the heat exchanger
therinal sleeves. Shell VI may now be lifted off,
exposing the heat exchanger cluster for measure-
ment and examination, At this point the sodium flow
dividing elbow is severed in a vertical plane at the
pump outlet, as is also the outside wall of the
sodium annular return passage. This completes the

severing of the lower deck connections, and the
lower deck and attached parts may now be lifted

off. A sling is attached to the heat exchanger
bundles, the temporary restraining band is removed,
and the heat exchangers are lifted clear of the sub-
assembly. Shell Vis now exposed, and the required
specimens and measurements are taken.

The subassembly is now removed from the turn-
table and replaced in the inverted position, that is,
north end down. Shell IV is now severed around the
circumference at the south end, the equator, and the
north end. This permits the north hemisphere of
Shell IV to drop down, and the south hemisphere may
be lifted off. The tiles surrounding the reflector-
moderator are now available for examination and
sampling.

The necessary tiles and cermet are next removed
so that Shell 1l{ may be severed around the circum-
ference at a point slightly north of the equator and
also at the south end. The Shell Il] segment is re-
moved so that the beryllium south hemisphere is ex-
posed. The spacers and sodium passages may be
examined now. The assembly is once again inverted
and secured to the turntable. The bolts through the
pressure ring into the beryllium are counterbored
away, and Shell ll is severed at the north end, The
support ring and the attached portion of Shell II
may then be lifted off, exposing the north beryllium
hemisphere for an examination of spacers and so-
dium passages. The band which locks the two be-
ryllium hemispheres is cut and removed, This
permits the removal of the north beryllium hemi-
sphere, which is sent to another cell location so
that the sodium passages may be examined. This
completes the primary disassembly of the reactor;
however, many of the removed pieces and subas-
semblies must go to small hot cells for further and
final processing.

Other items that may require further work in the
large hot cell machining area are the pumps, dump
tank, snow trap, control rod, and valves. Support
fixtures will be required for carrying each specific
part, as well as special tools for the required
cutting.

Hot Cell Equipment Criteria

The needs for hot cell equipment were studied
intensively, and much still remained to be done to
select the practical equipment, methods, and tech-
niques that would accomplish the desired result.

19
 

Appendix C covers the design criteria which had
been developed for the hot cell equipment.

Cutting Methods

A development program for the required tools for
both the test cell and the hot cell was worked up,
with the most promising cutting devices specified
for procurement or further testing. In connection
with these studies, a hydraulic shear capable of
pinching through a full-sized 3%-in. IPS NaK line
has been designed and built? This tool is re-
motely operable and will shear pipes, producing
almost complete closure with minimum contamination
spread (see Fig. 4). A portable band saw intended

for remote operation with a manipulator has been
procured and tested in a hot cell'? (see Fig. 11).
Hot cell disassembly operations to this date have
included plans for milling heads to be used for
drilling and milling. A 2)-in.-dia by 0.051-in.-
thick slitting saw cut satisfactorily and held up
reasonably well, but requires a rigid support. It
was planned to use a Bridgeport-type milling head
to drill a series of interlocking holes to part various
members. Tests to determine tool feeds, speeds,
expected life, changing method, production rate,
and control were to be run. Although all the data
were not obtained, sufficient tests were completed

to select the more practical cutting methods.

Preliminary tests showed that the interlocking
drilled hole method was slow and tool life was short.
The drilling of alternate large and small holes was
most effective and cut a Yin. Inconel plate at a
rate of 3 ft/hr. It could be used if access to the
cut area could not be gained in any other way, but,
in general, other processes look more attractive from
the standpoint of cutting rate and tool life.

Sawing operations were planned for the inner
shells, which would be highly active, Band saws,
reciprocating saws, and circular saws were con-
sidered, with preference given to the heavy chip
producers to keep activity down. Methods of con-
trolling the direction of cut, saw speed, and rate of
feed have to be developed. Blade life and speed
of accomplishing a given task are to be determined.

Grinding wheels, due to their high cutting rate,
warrant more detailed study. Controlled tests must

  
 

 

be done to determine optimum operation conditions,
and methods of control and elimination of airborne
contamination must be sought. Two types of ab-
brasive grinding were evaluated on Inconel: (1) a
dry wheel mounted on a radial arm and (2) a wet
wheel mounted on a horizontal track. The results
indicate extremely high cutting rates for both of
them, with acceptable wheel wear. As is shown in

Inconel pipes (to mock up the NaK sleeve) were cut

of this test are described in Appendix D.

Flame or arc cutting is the fastest known method
of separating Inconel. It has some major disadvan-
tages; for example, it leaves rough edges, it spreads
microscopic contamination, and the high temperature

may cause metallurgical changes. This process is
of limited usefulness for hot cell requirements but
should not be confused with the Heliarc cutting
process, which is described later.

The Heliarc cutting torch is relatively new and
was recently observed in action. It is believed
adaptable to cutting Inconel and stainless steels
from a remote mounting, and, since it does not re-
quire an oxidant, it has certain advantages for hot
cell work. However, the amount of activity released
will probably limit its use to those outer shells
which have the greatest bulk and are difficult to
reach, but where the activity level is relatively low.
The ability to cut through several layers of Inconel
in one pass has been demonstrated and will be
useful, especially when conventional cutting proc-
esses are unable to reach the area to be severed.

A more complete description of this torch appears
in Appendix E.

DRY GRIND CUT

Three concentric Inconel pipes, cut through in about 1 min with a dry 16-in.-dia

The ultrasonic (or magnetostriction) system of
cutting was tested on Inconel, but the cutting rate
was so slow that this method was not considered
satisfactory. It can be applied with better results
on materials which are too hard for normal cutting
processes, such as the boron carbide tiles. It is
not expected that these tiles will be cut unless
some special requirement makes it necessary, in
which case this process is available. Descriptions
of both these processes may be obtained from Ap-
pendix F.

The electric disintegration (Elox) process of ma-
chining appears tohave some usefulness for special
applications in the hot cell, principally in the aux-
iliary cells rather than in the main cell. A brief
test of Elox cutting was made on cutting Inconel on
an available machine. Slow cutting action was ob-
served, which was somewhat erratic and unsatis-
factory on Inconel. However, the process has shown

 
 

 

its usefulness in cutting extremely hard materials
which are good electrical conductors. One excep-
tion is the boron carbide tiles. It was found that
boron carbide is not sufficiently conducting to
permit the electric arc to do its work. In case
boron carbide tiles are tobe sampled, the only proc-
esses for cutting them are ultrasonic cutting (previ-
ously described), grinding with boron carbide, and
splitting them by fracturing, as the material is quite
brittle.

Methods of Measurement

The determination of the dimensions of the reactor
after it has been operated, in order to obtain direct
comparisons with the physical size and shape before
operation, is one of the major problems. Since the
second phase of these measurements must be made
in the hot cell, several measuring systems have been
studied and test work has been done on those which
looked promising, within the available time and fa-
cilities. Measurements to determine the following
possible changes were planned:

1. alignment of parts,

. creep deformation,

. buckling,

. thermal distortion,

. discontinuity due to stress or thermal shock,
. wear (pump parts).

In order for measurements to be of value in de-

oh WON

termining the above factors, a certain minimum ac-
curacy is required. For the purposes of this dis-
cussion it is assumed that changes in size due to
creep, to be significant, will be of the order of 0.1
to 1.0% of the original dimension and that measure-
ments should be accurate to within 120% of the
change. On this basis the pressure shell would
change in size in the range from 0.058 to 0.580 in.
on the diameter, and accuracy of £0.012 to £0.120
in. would be required, On Shell | at the smallest
diameter (6.75 in. approximately) the expected
changes will be in the range from 0.0067 to 0.067
in. and the accuracy required will be from +0.0013
to £0.013 in. lt follows that the desired accuracy
on the smaller parts is £0,001 in., which would re-
quire careful work even outside a hot cell.

The measuring systems may be arranged into four
main classifications, as follows:
1. optical systems,
2. photographic systems,
3. replication,
4. direct measurement,

Each of these classifications has several vari-
ations which were investigated. These are briefly
described below, and the important differences are
outlined in Table 3.

A. Optical Systems, = A-1. Rectilinear Tele-
scope, — This device consists of a telescope with
cross hairs, so mounted on ways that it can be
moved to any point in an area, in this case an area
about 5 ft wide by 7 ft high. The line of sight of
the telescope remains normal to the plane in which
the telescope moves at all times. The telescope
and ways would be mounted on the inside wall of
the hot cell with provisions made to view the cross
hairs of the telescope and to measure the exact
position of the telescope from outside the walls of
the cell. In the case of the pressure shell, for in-
stance, measurements would be made by sighting
the telescope on the visible edge of the pressure
shell on one side, noting the position of the tele-
scope, then moving the telescope across a diameter
until it sights on the opposite visible edge. The
difference in measurement between the two sights
would be the diameter of the pressure shell at that
particular point in the vertical direction and at that
particular rotational position of the reactor. As
many measurements as desired around the sphere
could be made by rotating the reactor on its mount-
ing turntable, and measurements from top to bottom
of the reactor could be made by moving the tele-
scope up or down.

A-2. Theodolite Range Finder. — This system of
measuring is essentially a surveying technique. Two
theodolites are mounted gn an accurately measured
base line. If a diameter is to be measured, targets
are placed against the reactor at the ends of the
diameter, The distance from the center of the target
to the edge is accurately known. Then, by angular
measurement with the theodolites, the coordinates
of the target center for each target are calculated.
From the distance between target centers, the di-
ameter is derived by subtracting twice the distance
from the center to the edge of the target.

A-3. Optical Measurement Through Hot Cell
Windows. ~ This system uses conventional optical
tooling instruments mounted outside the cell win-
dow.!! These instruments sweep the entire window
area and permit horizontal and vertical measurements

B. Photographic Systems, = B-1. Photographic
Lofting. — This system is essentially the photo-
graphic mapping of an object to produce a full-sized
image, which is then measured. The equipment re-
quired is a periscopic camera lens system of long
focal length capable of producing an image perhaps
18 in. in diameter. An enlarging system with a
movable image board, such as a vertical plate, is
suspended from tracks in the ceiling in such a
manner as to permit the board to be brought closer
to the lens or farther away to obtain the full-sized
image. Equipment for measuring the image, such
as trams, is also required, Two or more target
points are placed in the object space in a plane
normal to the optical axis and parallel to the axis
of the reactor. The plane is a known distance from
the axis of the reactor. The distance between the
target points is accurately determined. A negative
is made on a glass plate. An enlargement is made,
with the image adjusted in size until the distance
between target points on the image is the same as
the actual distance. Measurements are then made
of diameters, for instance, on the enlargement. From
these measurements the actual diameter is calcu-
lated.

B-2, Photographic Contour Mapping (by projecting
a grid). — This system is basically the same as the
lofting reproduction measuring system described in
the preceding section, with the addition of a grid
projecting system normal to the optical projector
capable of producing a sharply defined spot of light
about Y in. or less in diameter on the reactor. The
projector would swing on a horizontal axis so that
the spot of light would sweep a plane perpendicular
to the optical axis of the camera. With the hot cell
dark, the camera shutter would be opened and the
projector would sweep the spot of light over the re-
actor, thus recording on the film the intersection of
a plane with the surface of the reactor. Next, the
projector would be moved a specified distance, say
1 in., along its horizontal axis and again swept
over the reactor, thus producing on the film the
intersection of a second plane with the surface of
the reactor. This process would be repeated until
the image of a quadrant of the reactor was mapped
on the film. The reactor would then be rotated 90°
on its mounting turntable, and a contour map of a
second quadrant made; and so on for the third and
fourth quadrants. It may be feasible to use a mul-
tiple projector so that a quadrant can be mapped
with one sweep of the projector. From the contour

26

map as produced above, by either mathematical or
graphic techniques, the rectilinear coordinates of
any point on the exposed surface of the reactor
could be determined.

B-3. Photogrammetric Technique. — This may be
described as an aerial mapping technique and differs
from the procedure described earlier under lofting in
that the photograph would be only 4 x 5 in. approxi-
mately.

The equipment would consist of a camera with
periscopic lens system, for shielding the film, so
mounted in the wall of the hot cell that the optical
axis of the camera system would intersect the axis
of the reactor. The lens system would need to be
carefully calibrated, and the exact distance of the
lens system from the axis of the reactor would need
to be established. The photographic negative
would be measured with a coordinate measuring
microscope. For instance, from the diameter of the
reactor as measured on the negative, the actual di-
ameter of the reactor could be calculated.

C. Replication, — The purpose of replication on -
disassembly is to obtain a replica surface which is
accurate enough to be measured, It is intended to
measure on the replica the distance between scribed
lines, between weld beads, and in some cases to
measure the curvature.

The intent of the development work on replicas is
to determine the feasibility of producing replicas of
sufficient accuracy to provide a measurement of the
reactor parts on disassembly. This accuracy should
be within +0.003 in. Also to be determined is the
amount of radioactive contamination that will adhere
to the replicas. It is expected that an activated
surface which has been decontaminated will not
transfer activity to the replicas.

There are two methods of applying the replicating
material —~ by spraying and by pouring into a mold.
Due tothe difficulty of design for and positioning of
molds on odd-shaped contours in the hot cell, the
spraying methods appear most promising. The
spraying technique will require development of a
parting method so that the replica will cover only
an area which can be withdrawn and thus can be re-
moved, There are some cases, such as a replica of
the fuel passage at the bottom, where the pouring
technique will be preferred.

Three types of material can be used to produce
replicas: metals, plastics, and plaster, Each is
discussed separately later,

 
 

There are three questions regarding replication
for which answers are required:

1. How accurately can replicas be prepared, and
which method and material provide greatest accuracy ?
(Tests have indicated satisfactory accuracy with
both metal spraying and gypsum casting methods.)

2. How are molds to be built or parting lines
provided in the hot cell?

3. How much radioactive contamination will
adhere to the replica?

C-1. Metal Replicas. — Although metals are
readily cast in normal operations, the use of such
methods does not appear feasible in a hot cell.
Flame-spraying of metals, however, is practical.
Metals are flame-sprayed by a special metallizing
oxyacetylene torch which automatically melts metal
wire and blows the molten metal on the surface to
be coated in the manner of a paint sprayer. The
temperature effects on the accuracy of the replica
are believed minor in that it is reported that metal
can be sprayed on paper without charring the paper.

Various metals can be used in this operation,
such as aluminum, brass, lead alloys, or steel. In
order to minimize the heating of the part being
coated, the lead alloys appear most desirable. From
the point of view of strength and rigidity of the
replica without unwieldy thickness, aluminum or
brass would be better. The proper metal to use can
be determined only by trial, with the principal con-
sideration being the accuracy of duplication with

icient strength to permit hot cell handling. Use
of reinforcing wire mesh or a stiff backup metal
may be found necessary. Lead alloy wire has been
used with a metallizing gun and trial replicas have
been successfully made, as shown in Fig. 15.

  

Several replicas have been produced of Shell |
sections, and a comparison of the dimensions, sur-
face finishes, and duplication of detail makes this
process look excellent. However, traces of lead
alloys left within the reactor could seriously weaken
Inconel, and for this reason it is not likely that
lead alloy metallizing will be permitted for the
‘‘before’’ dimensions. Interested divisions have
been requested to comment on this problem and
make recommendations.

C-2. Plastic or Resin Replicas. — The thermoset-
ting resins that cure at room temperature after the
addition of an accelerator, such as the epoxies or
polyesters, are suitable for use in preparing replicas.
The usual method of handling is to pour into a mold
and allow to harden. It is reported that there is a
spraying method for handling them, but it is not
known whether this method could be used in a hot

 

Fig. 15. Lead Alloy Replica of a Reactor Component.

cell. It appears that developing a thick layer would
be particularly troublesome with a spraying tech-
nique because of the setting time required.

The epoxies are frequently used in preparing rep-
licas, but they have extreme adhesiveness when ap-
plied to metal. Applying a releasing material with
adequate thoroughness might cause difficulty in a
hot cell and would rule out the use of resins for the
replica of the fuel passage at the bottom of the re-
actor. For other replicas to which a pour technique
is adaptable, such as the replicas of Shells | and Il,
the casting resins may be suitable.

The process of making resin replicas consists in
preparing a mold, with the area to be duplicated as
one side of the bottom, and filling the mold with the
mixed resin and accelerator.

C-3. Plaster Replicas. — There are several types
of gypsum plasters available with varying amounts
of shrinkage or expansion on setting. The U.S.
Gypsum Co. markets several under various trade
names such as Hydrocal, Ultracal, and Hydrostone.
Some are reported to have an expansion on setting
of as little as 0.0002 in./in. These materials will
show extremely fine detail (such as scribe lines on
the test piece) which we will require.

Unfortunately the gypsum plasters are not readily
sprayable. Two test cases were produced by the
spraying technique by the Gunite method, but actu-
ally with the Bondact gun. Detail was fair with
adequate strength, but the poor performance of the
specific gun used indicates the need for better
equipment if this program is to be pursued. The
replicas produced are shown in Fig. 16.

During the setting period the plasters pass through
a so-called plastic stage when they can be handled
as a mason handles mortar, Whether replicas could
be made in the hot cell by this means is not known.
It appears doubtful.

However, there are some replicas required on dis-
assembly to which a technique of pouring into a
mold is applicable. These are the replicas of the
fuel passage at the bottom of the reactor and the
replicas of the surfaces of Shells | and Il, and pos-
sibly the replica of the bottom of Shell lil. The
process consists in preparing a mold for containing
the cement in the liquid state. The area to be du-
plicated is one side or the bottom of the mold. The
mold is filled with a plaster-water mixture. When

 

 

the mixture is hard, the mold and plaster replica
are removed (Figs. 17 and 18).

D. Direct Measurement. — The use of snap gages
for direct measurement of the item in the cell has
been proposed, because it has been used at other
AEC installations. The method has ruggedness and
simplicity to recommend it, but becomes awkward
for handling the large number of required gages by
remote manipulators. Schemes for using direct
reading dial indicators mounted in a suitable frame-
work to ride over the reactor have also been
sketched. Such methods can be used if no better
tools are available, but their use is to be avoided
because of the problems involved in their use and
the excessive time required.

5. SPECIAL STUDIES

Associated with the specific studies for removal,
disassembly, tools, and facilities were studies of
shielding, decontamination, size of air-borne parti-
cles, disposal of radioactive materials, and a mock-
up of the hot cell facility, This work is discussed
separately as much for emphasis on its importance
as for lack of a more suitable place for the material.

Shielding Studies?

The wall thickness required for the ART hot cell
is dependent upon reactor power level, operating
time, time elapse after shutdown, fraction of the
fission products contained by the reactor, and allow-
able dosage rate established for the outside of the
cell wall. The wall thickness was calculated for a
reactor power of 60 Mw and infinite operating time
(in order to approximate operation for 1000 hr). At
least 20% of the curies of activity would have plated
out on the reactor. The reactor would also have
contained activity in fuel which had not been rinsed
out, For the purposes of calculation, the fraction
of fission products contained in the reactor was
taken as 100%. A change from 20% to 100% only
represented an increase of 5 in. in the required wall
thickness.

The assumed maximum permissible dose for a
person outside the cell wall is 100 mr/week, or 2.2
mr /hr for an 8-hr day and 5-day week, To allow cell
operators to accumulate a margin of allowable dose
for necessary work in higher radiation fields, a
dosage rate of 0.5 mr/hr was selected. These wall
thickness calculations were based on a comparable
study'3 for similar conditions. This study was a
multigroup calculation for gross fission products
and Co®? radiation using data from shielding design
manuals.'4:15 The results are shown in Fig. 19.
The required thickness is indicated as 4 ft of ba-
rytes concrete. It was recommended that a con-
servative thickness of 4.5 ft be used to allow for
future application of the cell to higher power re-
actors,

lators and other equipment would have produced

Reasonable precautions would have been required
when intense sources were brought into line with a
hole; however, special shielding would not have
been required unless it proved necessary to keep
personnel in line with a hole at the same time that
major sources inside the cell were also in line.

Decontamination of Pressure Vessel,

Hot Cell, and Tools

Decontamination of the ART pressure vessel, the
hot cell, and other associated tooling has been con-
sidered, but no definite or final steps have been
specified because they are directly contingent upon
the results of the ART operations.

For the pressure vessel, the procedure may be to
wash down the reactor, support structure, and tank
walls with hydraulic jets that are lowered down
through the access hole. A dilute acid wash so-
lution appears to be the most suitable for this pur-
pose. A sump pump installed near the floor of the
pressure vessel would remove this contaminated
liquid through the access hole, or if the volume is
not too great, it could be left in the pressure vessel
for removal after the reactor has been removed.

In the hot cell the problem is somewhat different.
The walls may have tobe decontaminated at frequent

31

 
intervals to permit safe entrance of operating and
maintenance personnel. Each of the reactor pieces,
as it is removed, will have to be decontaminated
before it is sent to storage or to a small cell for
further work. All of the tools which will require
maintenance must also be decontaminated before
being withdrawn into the intermediate hot cell.
Visits to otherhot cells at ORNL, and discussions
with the operating personnel, have revealed differ-
ent philosophies on hot cell operations.

One group feels that the cell area should be capa-
ble of being cleaned up adequately for personnel
entry. Another group advocates the complete rinse-
down of the walls and equipment with a powerful
spray or rinse, washing all water and contaminants
into a hot drain. One installation, where water is
permitted, cuts up all critical assemblies under 10
to 15 ft of water. The underwater technique cannot
be seriously considered because of the presence of
sodium as well as the radioactivity dispersion from
fused salt systems, but when the major elements
have been severed and opened, cleaning the cell
interior may proceed safely.

Work at the 4501 cell has been successfully carried
on in disassembling ‘‘in-pile’’ loops by cutting
through the surface of the loop with a high speed
grinding wheel, The radioactive dust which accumu-
lates on the cell walls and on the equipment has
been washed down by means of high velocity jets,
and all the contamination products have been washed
down a hot drain. This method might be satisfactory
in the large hot cell, but it introduces complica-
tions. For example, there could be a reaction with
sodium or NaK which might be left in lines or crev-
ices around the reactor. The possibility of washing
active materials into areas which cannot be easily
cleaned is highly undesirable, However, an effort
has been made to design the large hot cell with
straight clean walls and scuppers so that the wash
solution will easily drain,

Small tools may be cleaned in a dilute acid so-
lution. Large tools and machinery, however, may
not be dipped in cleaning baths and may have to be
sprayed. In many cases it should be possible to
cover the tools with plastic hoods in order to limit
the amount of contamination they collect.

Size Distribution of Waste Particles
from Severance Techniques

A study '® was made by an MIT Practice School
group on particle size distribution, that is, the size

32

of air-borne particles given off by the sawing, grind-
ing, Heliarc cutting, and hydraulic shear cutting
methods. It is apparent that the shear is the clean-
est of all the methods considered. All the others
gave rather large dust contamination values, It was
found, for example, in grinding Inconel, either wet
or dry, that 10% to 107 particles per cubic centimeter
of air were drawn through a filter of the measuring
equipment. This amount of possible activity could
be tolerated only if the hot cell were equipped with
an adequate filtering system. For this reason the
hydraulic shear appeared to be the most desirable
method for cutting pipes in the pressure vessel and
probably also for rough cutting and removal of mani-
folds in the hot cell. Torch cutting is the least de-
sirable of the methods considered, from the air
contamination standpoint. It resulted in the creation
of about 107 to 10? particles per cubic centimeter.
However, it might have been practical to use either
the torch or grinding for the outer shell girth cut be-
cause of the low level of activity in this shell (VII)
as compared with Shells | and 11.17

Disposal of Radioactive Materials

Radioactive materials were expected to consist of
reactor parts, air-borne particles, and contaminated
solutions.

The Health Physics Division recommends that
contaminated waste solutions be disposed of in
ORNL waste pit No. 3. Solution transport to this
pit may be in the Operations Division's 4300-gal-
capacity tank truck, which has 1 in. of protective
lead shielding in front of the tank. Solutions must
be made slightly alkaline before or when they are
transferred into the truck tank.

The reactor parts were to be placed in storage
containers and placed in a vault or other storage
facility until required in the auxiliary cells.

The philosophy at ORNL on discharge-air quality
required that the released air should be normally
suitable for human breathing; therefore, the dis-
charge system should be designed either for con- -
tainment of the discharge air or for release at an
elevation in the ORNL plant area approximately
equal to that of the isotope area stack No. 3039. -
In the case of the RDHC this would have meant
not only that the air must be discharged through

an absolutely efficient and reliable filter system
but that the discharge air would have to be either
recirculated as clean air supply to a hermetically
sealed facility or discharged up a 250-ft stack. It
was planned to investigate this problem further,
particularly from the point of view of possibly dis-
charging the properly filtered air at the facility roof
elevation. Of course, the used filters after removal
were to be placed in dust-tight containers and dis-
posed of at the burial grounds.

Tools and equipment used in the hot cell were to
be thoroughly decontaminated before they were taken
out of the auxiliary cell, If the count could not be
brought to tolerance levels, it was planned to dis-
pose of the equipment at the burial ground rather
than risk the spread of contamination.

Facility Mockup for Cold Testing

In the event project schedules did not allow time
for preliminary testing, a full-scale cold mockup of
a portion of the hot cell was considered necessary
for checking and shakedown of tools and procedures
as well as for personnel training.

There was the possibility of using the ETU for
this work, although it was realized that the need
for rapidly gaining entry into this unit would not
result in a procedure identical with that planned
for the hot cell. Nevertheless, the direct operation
of tools and fixtures on a full-sized model was con-
sidered a practical approach to the problems under
hot conditions. This would have been especially
useful in the development of replication technique,
optical measurements, testing of cutting methods,
and development and checking of special tools and
fixtures,

Underwater Disassembly Study

Some consideration was given to underwater dis-
assembly for removal of the reactor from the pres-
sure cell. Since plans were to effect the fuel
transfer, sodium transfer, and the fuel flush opera-
tion remotely, the first step upon removing the man-
hole cover was to cut the recovery tank free, In
view of this it was proposed that, following the re-
moval of the recovery tank and the postoperation
sample tank, the cell be decontaminated, the top
hemisphere of the cell be cut off, and then the cell
be flooded with water. It was then planned that
the remaining removal operations would be handled
under water from a suitable platform. Accordingly
a study was initiated to investigate the contami-
nation aspects of such a system.

 

To obtain a rough idea as to what would happen
to the estimated 2000 curies of beta activity under
flood conditions, a simple experiment was per-
formed.'® Water slightly acidified with nitric acid
was agitated in a 10% x 14 x 2Y in. pan as suc-
cessive quantities of radioactive Sr%0 were dis-
solved, Readings of beta activity were taken with
a “‘cutie pie’’ instrument at a point 8% in. above
the liquid level. The activity was primarily of
1-Mev energy. Samples of the solution were ana-
lyzed for activity content with the following results:

Beta Activity 8} ine

Above Surface Activity Content {uc/ml)

(mr/ hr)
18 0.35
85 1.50
110 2.00

Although it appears that the activity count meas-
ured above the surface was roughly proportional to
the activity content of the liquid, the study was not
pursued further because of the potential hazard of
working with sodium submerged in water.

6. FACILITY
Consideration of 7503 Facility

As was stated previously, the early project think-
ing was that the two pits in Building 7503 (ART
facility) used for ARE operation and disassembly
would provide suitable space for ART disassembly.
A single pit 28 ft by 21 ft by 22 ft deep would result
if the partition between them were removed. Inas-
much as the walls of these pits are constructed of
standard reinforced concrete 18 in. thick, an ad-
ditional 3% ft of dense concrete shielding would
have to be added to each wall. The resulting 21 x
14 ft floor space is obviously too small when com-
pared with the 20 x 52 ft area needed for disas-
sembly in a hot cell or the 3000-ft? area required for
the assembly of the reactor.

The space available for an operating area for such
a hot cell is completely inadequate. Experience
with hot cells has shown that a shielded area for
the repair and decontamination of tools and equip-
ment adjacent to the working area is imperative.
Space limitations prohibit constructing such a cell
in Building 7503. While the 30-ton crane installed

33
in the building is adequate for transporting the re-
actor from the operating cell to the disassembly
cell, radiation levels would be too high to permit
removing the shield plugs of the disassembly cell
after the reactor shield has been removed, thus pro-
hibiting further use of the crane. The low head
room in such a cell would not permit the installation
of adequate handling equipment inside the cell.
Underwater disassembly of the ART in this or any
other area is not feasible because of the violent
chemical reactions between water and liquid metals
and because of the requirement for precise measure-
ment.

Consideration of Other Arrangements

The feasibility of constructing the RDHC adjacent
to Building 7503 was considered so as to minimize
the movement of the reactor and to take advantage
of the 30-ton overhead crane. To do this would re-
quire that the RDHC be located directly in front of
the building, replacing the main access ramp to the
building. The RDHC would then have to be built
essentially underground, with the cell roof serving
as the building access driveway. The cost of such
underground construction and the fact that movement
of the shielded radioactive reactor within the Labo-
ratory area is not a critical problem offset any real
advantages for this arrangement. It has the further
disadvantage of requiring that construction proceed
simultaneously with the installation and operation
of the ART reactor.

Since ORNL has no hot cell facilities which are
capable of handling an assembly as large as the
ART, use of the GE-ANP hot shop was reviewed for
its suitability for the ART disassembly. However,
this was considered impractical on the basis of (1)
the potential shipping hazard to the ART, (2) the
necessary revision to the GE-ANP facility, and (3)
the probable scheduling difficulties.

As was pointed out above, a large portion of the
information to be gained from the ART is obtainable
only from examination during and after disassembly.
No estimate of any damage to the reactor resulting
from shipment would be possible. Therefore the
information obtained by disassembly would have to
be discounted an unknown amount. Basically, the
GE-ANP hot shop has adequate shielding, crane
facility, and remote handling equipment for ART
disassembly. However, the elevation and location
of the viewing windows as designed for the G-E re-
quirements might be somewhat awkward to work

34

through on the ART; also, use of the underwater
storage facility would be prohibitive for the ART,
because of the NaK and sodium explosion hazard.
To use the GE-ANP facility, then, would require
sufficient modifications to make certain that all
ART disassembling operations could be performed,
to provide a dry storage facility, and to install the
specialized tooling required for ART disassembly.
Since the GE-ANP facility would have to be avail-
able on a continuous basis for the estimated amount
of time needed to disassemble the ART, scheduling
and operations would be exceedingly difficult and
costly for both the GE-ANP and ART programs.
Disassembly and inspection of the ART will re-
quire approximately 12 to 18 months. Because ex-
perience indicates that the need for handling large
pieces of highly radioactive assemblies is increas-
ing rapidly both in number and scope, it is antici-
pated that the usefulness of the facility for other
applications will be extensive. Therefore it is be- -
lieved that, by the time the facilities would be
completed, reactor programs in progress would pro-
vide problems requiring the massive collection of -
data from numerous loops and irradiation experi-
ments. Hence, it is anticipated that the proposed
facility for the ART would be in constant use from
the time it is completed.

Proposed Facility

The proposal for a large hot cell provides for con-
struction of a large, single hot cell divided into two
rooms (Figs. 20 and 21). One of these rooms, the
disassembly and decontamination area, is approxi-
mately 52 ft long by 20 ft wide by 36 ft high, clear
inside dimensions. The other, for shielded mainte-
nance of cell tools and equipment, is approximately
20 ft long by 20 ft wide by 36 ft high, clear inside
dimensions. The area is served by an overhead
crane and by two overhead manipulators mounted
from a common bridge. Along the sides and one end
of this cell are operating areas equipped with re-
motely controlled handling equipment and high
density viewing windows. Wall plugs over each of
the windows provide access for master-slave manip-
ulators. A tool and equipment setup area is located
along a portion of one side of this cell. A change
room adjacent thereto provides for control of per-
sonnel access to and egress from the contaminated
setup area. A tunnel connects the cell to a shielded
storage area, so that radioactive materials can be

transferred from the cell and safely stored until
needed without requiring entry into the cell. Full-
width double shielding doors at the end of the cell
and between the two cell rooms are provided for in-
sertion of the equipment to be disassembled. Also,
an access door is provided for each room, to permit
man entry or small tool transfer into the cell while
contaminated. The cell is constructed of high-
density concrete, with the walls about 4) ft thick
and the roof 2, ft thick. A reinforced concrete floor
will be provided.

The operating areas will be steel frame, with the
exterior walls of masonry construction. A 30-ton
overhead crane will operate over the entire length
of the cell and will extend over a loading platform
at the end of the cell. A remotely operated mechan-
ical conveyor system will take radioactive parts
from the cell, through the tunnel, to the storage fa-
cility.

Special disassembly tools and equipment will be
required both for the disassembly work in the RDHC
and for the removal of a reactor from its operating
station, such as the ART cell in Building 7503.
The hot cell will contain a disassembly table (lift-
turntable) where a reactor can be held in position,
rotated, and raised or lowered for disassembly oper-
ations. When the lift-turntable with the reactor is
lowered into the shaft and a shielding cover is
placed over the opening, a ‘‘safe’’ is formed. The
working area of the cell may then be cleaned to
permit entrance of maintenance personnel.

Included in the RDHC building are the facility
requirements for space, equipment and furniture for
office, laboratory, and building services.

All qir entering the building will be filtered. The
exhaust air will pass through a double set of filters
into a stack. With the exception of the cells and
building services areas, the building will be air

conditioned. Building services that will be provided
include clean compressed air, vacuum cleaning
system, intercommunication, telephone, power,
lighting, heating, demineralized water, sanitary
water, sanitary waste, and provisions for special
decontamination solutions. All radioactive waste
solutions will be transferred to the existing ORNL
tank farm. A fire detection system will be installed.
Also included will be instrumentation as required
for air flow control and radiation activity monitoring.

The RDHC building will occupy an area of approxi-
mately 11,000 £2, and the combined facilities will
occupy approximately 30,000 £12, including the
storage unit. A list of layout drawings prepared for
study of tool placement and space utilization is
given in Table 4.

Site Investigations

In conjunction with the establishment of design
criteria for the large hot cell facility, possible site
locations at ORNL were investigated. This investi-
gation was conducted with the assistance of other
laboratory personnel and in particular with people
from the Solid State Division. The results are pre-
sented in Appendix P.

Shortly after this report was prepared, a group
called the Central High Level Laboratory Advisory
Committee reviewed the study and indicated a site
in the 3500 area at X-10 as the most favorable lo-
cation for the RDHC (see Fig. 22). It should be
noted that the Central High Level Laboratory
(CHLL) was a large proposed facility which in-
cluded the RDHC as a unit. A design subcommittee
for the CHLL advisory committee was established
to serve in an advisory and review capacity with the
objective of obtaining a facility that not only would
be useful for disassembly of the ART but would
have lasting usefulness as a general hot cell fa-
cility.

7. SCHEDULE AND COST ESTIMATE
Schedule

Construction of the large hot cell and procurement
of disassembly tools and fixtures were scheduled so
that they would have been available for use in the
event that disassembly of the ART was required fol-
lowing commencement of nuclear operation.’ 9,20
Allowing the time necessary to remove and transfer
the ART to the RDHC, it was concluded that, to
avoid delaying the program, the completion date was
to be September 30, 1960. If the RDHC facility had

not been available for use at that time, there would

have been a delay in inspecting and evaluating the
reactor machinery to obtain the valuable data on
what happened to the ART components during re-
actor operation.

It was estimated that disassembly of the ART
would take 12 to 18 months. When that operation
was finished, the cell was to be available for dis-
assembly and maintenance requirements of other
large radioactive equipment. It would also meet
one of the basic facility requirements for the de-
velopment of advanced aircraft reactors.

Cost Estimate

The cost of the basic RDHC structure is estimated
to be $528,000. This does not include the shielded
hot cell. The cost of services, estimated at
$705,000, includes air conditioning for building work
areas and a separate system for special filtration
and cleaning of contaminated air from the hot cell.

The estimated cost of $384,000 for other struc-
tures covers the shielded storage cell for radio-
active reactor components and parts. The cost of
the shielded transfer tunnel connecting the storage
cell with the main disassembly cell is also in-
cluded.

The large item of $2,969,000 for equipment and
installation covers the very expensive heavily
shielded hot cell with its crane and built-in equip-
ment plus the remote-control equipment needed in
reactor disassembly. The transparent shielding
windows to permit viewing of the operations are
included in the total equipment cost, along with the
manipulators, cutting and machining tools, and
special equipment items required to make the hot
cell fully usable for the purposes for which it is
designed. A tabulation of the estimated cost is
presented in Table 5.

APPENDIX C. RDHC HOT CELL EQUIPMENT’

Introduction

The equipment to be installed and used in the dis-
assembly cell may be grouped into five general cate-
gories:

A. Handling Equipment

B. Cutting Tools

C. Observation Tools

D. Measurement Tools

E. Cell Service Equipment
The tools and equipment will be listed along with
the criteria for each, This outlines the plans for
the equipment at this time, Where only the name of
an item is given it indicates arequired tool for which
criteria had not yet been developed. The equipment
is based upon facility dimensions given in “ART
Disassembly Cell Facility Criteria.’*?

A. Handling Equipment (All Remotely Operable)

1. 30-Ton Crane. ~ Remotely operable with con-
trols at viewing windows or by easily attached pend-
ant; hook travel from 3 ft above floor of lowest pit
to highest retracted position available with stand-
ard crane; adequate high and low speeds on bridge,
trolley, and lifting motion to permit accurate posi-
tioning and rapid equipment removal — use 7503
crane speeds as a guide; the crane track and power
supply shall permit the crane to pass through the
large shieldingdoors (a hinged track is envisioned);
a method is required for retrieving the crane should
it fail while the cell is hot.

2, Overbead Manipulator (Bridge Type). — Re-
motely operable from any viewing window; tele-
scoping support such as used on Farrell-Birmingham
or General Electric manipulators (this support would
carry a General Mills or a Borg-Warner type arm);
two of these units would be mounted on a single
bridge; each on a separate trolley; manipulator hand
would have to reach floor and retract to 21 ft above
cell floor or higher; coverage of full cell floor area
desirable.

3. Bracket for Support Structure. — Assume sup-
port structure plus reactor weighs 30 tons; bracket
to extend from wall far enough to support end of
bridge support; bracket to be readily removable
with manipulators.

4. Turntable and Lift. — The lift platform shall
be 8 ft in diameter; the lift capacity shall be 20

 

preliminary report by V. J. Kelleghan dated January
28, 1957.

2 pppendix O of this report.

66

tons plus turntable; the lift shall lower the top of
the reactor 5 ft below the cell floor and raise the
bottom of the platform 3 ft above it; the lift pit
shall be drainable and a wiper shall seal the plat-
form edge to the pit wall; a locking device such as
opposed hydraulic cylinders shall lock the lift plat-
form in position; the turntable mounted on the lift
platform shall have a high and low speed to permit
its use for rough turning or accurate angular posi-
tioning; table diameter to be 5% ft; table to have
self-centering 3-jaw chuck traversing from 60 in. to
30 in. circle.

5. Pump Gripper. — This tool will resemble ice
tongs or a gear puller and will be used for with-
drawing the fuel or sodium pumps after they are
freed by their jack bolts; the tool will be hung from
a crane hook on the manipulator.

6. Model 8 Manipulator. — A number of Argonne
National Lab Model 8 type manipulators will be re- -
quired; American Machine and Foundry is one sup-
plier of this type unit,

7. Radisphere. — A self-propelled and shielded .
vehicle for safe man entry into the hot cell is de-
sired; shielding equivalent to 1 ft of high density
concrete; integral air supply; two manipulator arms;
one-man capacity; communication; adequate viewing
to permit maintenance work; safety cable for re-
trieving car,

8. Holding Vise. — A number of positioning and
holding vises will be required for machining specific
parts.

9. Special Slings and Bails. — |n order to pick up
some equipment with the head room available, special
slings will be required (this applies also to delicate
equipment with poor weight distribution); special
bails which fit the 30-ton crane hook and which can
be engaged remotely will be required.

10. Dollies for Lead Shield, — Dollies are required
to hold the sides of the lead shield while they are
disengaged. It is expected that the dollies used for
attaching the lead shield will be available for its
removal.

11. Jigs and Fixtures. — A number of drilling and
cutting jigs will probably be required for such things
as removal of the control rod.

12. Handling Cans for Storage, — In the general
disassembly plan each piece removed will be decon-
taminated and placed in a large can. For smaller
parts, small cans will be filled and then placed in
the large cans. Two sizes of large cans are planned,

 
both 6 ft tall. One will be 3 ft in diameter and the
other 6 ft, There will be storage for 36 three-foot
cans and 3 six-foot cans. When a large can is filled,
a lid will be attached and the can placed in the stor-
age facility. The cans will be stainless steel and
designed to be readily decontaminated, The bail on
the can should facilitate remote handling.

13. Decontamination Equipment, — Decontamination
of severed reactor parts shall be accomplished in a
stainless steel pan, The pan shall be 8 ft in di-
ameter and have a 3-in. raised lip at the periphery.
It should have a low spot from which a small pump
can recirculate it through a nozzle for raising or
dumping it into a hot drain. The suction to the pump
shall be filtered so that large chips, etc., will re-
main in the pan, It should be possible to remove the
pan from the cell remotely. This may only require
appropriately placed lifting eyes.

B. Cutting Tools (All Remotely Operable)

1. NaK Line Saw. ~ A cut-off tool for the main
and auxiliary NaK lines is required, These are 3%
and 2Y-in, Sch. 40 Inconel lines which must be cut
without distortion since the lead shield and shells
will be slipped over them, A saw, cutting wheel, or
end mill appears to be the most satisfactory tool for
this job.

2. Drill Head. — Drilling has been adiudged the
best means of removing large chips with minimum
tool rigidity while cutting irregularly shaped pieces
from the reactor. For this operation a Bridgeport
drilling head was chosen with means for positioning
it to be provided.

3. Drill Head Mounting and Positioning Unit. —
The unit for mounting the drill head shall carry the
head to the center of the lift platform. The head
should have vertical and horizontal travel of 5 in,
It should be possible to rotate and lock the drill
head at any angle from vertical to horizontal and
drill at that angle. Maximum drill size is 1 in. The
range of travel of the drill head positioning unit
shall permit drilling through a range of from 50 to
60 in. above the cell floor,

4, Coolant and Circulating System, — A cooling
fluid will be used in the drilling and cutting opera-
tions. A catch pan, filter, and return pump shall be
provided at the turntable to recirculate this fluid,
The catch pan shall not be larger in diameter than
the pit in which the lift table operates.

5. Guillotine. — A number of small lines and
instrument connections will have to be sheared off.

A Manco unit to be carried by a crane and operated
remotely will be used, One-inch Sch. 40 Inconel
lines will be cut with this unit. In addition, a large
shear with a 3%-in. IPS capacity will be available.

6. Sealant Injector. —~ A tool similar to a stud
driver has been developed. This unit will shoot a
hollow needle into any of the Inconel pipes from the
reactor. A sealing medium will then be injected into
the line through this hollow needle much like a hypo-
dermic needle injection. The unit should be adjust-
able for 3% -in. to %-in. Sch. 40 Inconel pipe. The
injector will be used to seal a line before it is cut
off and thus contain contamination.

7. Impact Wrench. — The impact applied to the
shaft should be adjustable from that required to
loosen the smallest bolt to a maximum force capable
of shearing the largest bolt used in the reactor as-
sembly. The adjustment of torque to be applied by
the hammer should be suited to regulation with a
manipulator,

8. Cutting Torch and Accessories. — The torch
should be adapted to handling with a manipulator,

It will be used to cut Inconel as well as steel, so
necessary auxiliaries should be provided.

9. Do-All Bandsaw, - A Do-All bandsaw model
26 or equivalent shall be provided. Controls shall
be remote, and the unit will be located in the equip-
ment maintenance cell,

10. Portable Tools. ~ A group of portable tools
equivalent to those available to a maintenance me-
chanic shall be provided. These would include
hand tools, drills, grinders, cut-off wheels, impact
wrenches, etc.

11. Pinch-Off Shears, ~ A pinch-off shear similar
to a bolt cutter shall be adapted to remote operation,
This will be used to cut instrument tubing, ALE by
0.065-in,-wall stainless steel, and lead wires,

12, Special Cutters, — A group of special cutters
may have to be developed for disassembling the
sample and chem tech tanks.

13. Cutting Wheel and Mounting. ~ A pneumati-
cally or electrically driven cutting wheel shall be
designed. The mounting for this wheel shall be in-
stalled near the main turntable but only if operation
shows that a wheel of this type is required.

14, Remotely Operable Center Punch, ~Since one
method for cutting out of planes, etc., is by means
of drilling a series of closely spaced holes, a spring
loaded center punch is required, It should be possi-
ble to space the drilled holes by adding a locating
pin to this unit. In this way a group of equally

67

 
spaced centers can be located, The punch will be
set and used by a manipulator hand. Minimum hole
spacing % in,, maximum 1 in,

C. Observation Tools

1. Shielding Windows. — The shielding afforded
by these windows shall be equivalent to 5 ft of ba-
rytes concrete (230 ib/cu ft). The cold face of the
window shall be approximately 3 x 4 ft, If a combi-
nation of glass and zinc bromide will give adequate
shielding at less cost than all glass, the combina-
tion window is acceptable.

2. Periscope. — The periscope will penetrate a
5-ft-thick shielding wall. The floor on both sides
of the wall will be at the same elevation, The peri-
scope should extend to permit viewing from floor
level to 7 ft above the floor. It is expected that the
periscope will be used to look through a microscope
and to take pictures of small objects. Kollmorgan
Optical Corp. makes a number of acceptable peri-
scopes. The radiation level in the cell will be
6500 r/hr . Periscope lenses shall be non-browning.

3. Binoculars and Mounting, ~ The binoculars
will be mounted on the cold side of the observation
windows. A flexible support similar to BX cable
shall be provided. The two eyepieces of the bin-
oculars should be easily separated so that either
section could be used as a telescope. 8X binocu-
lars are acceptable.

4, TV Equipment. —A TV camera will be mounted
on the 30-ton crane, This camera would be capable
of viewing the hook through its full travel and also
pan around the cell for viewing operations on the
floor. The camera shall be remotely operable and
have one normal and one high-magnification lens,

5. Photographic Equipment. — A still camera for
use outside the windows and through the periscope
is required. The camera shall be of the reflex type
which permits viewing the image seen by the lens.
A movie camera is also required for taking pictures
of the disassembly methods and procedures to aid
others working on similar problems,

6. Borescope. — Borescopes for looking into small
diameter (0.210 in.) and larger diameter % in.) pipe
are desired, These should be approximately 36 in.
long and suitable for viewing through the periscope.
The glass used in these units shall be non-browning
in a radiation level of 6500 r/hr.

7. Portable Lights. — A free standing group of
sodium vapor and fluorescent lights is required,
These units should be readily lamped and balanced

68

for handling with a crane hook. These lights will
be used for picture taking and increased illumination
where required,

D. Measurement Tools

1. Coordinate Scope. ~ In measuring irregular
shapes such as shells it is felt that a telescope
viewed through a periscope could be developed. This
telescope would be carried on accurately calibrated
lead screws moving the scope in a vertical and hori-
zontal direction, If the scope is always perpendicu-
lar to the piece to be measured, it can be sighted on
points and their coordinates determined. A travel of
60 in, is required in both directions. An accuracy
of 10.001 in. is desired in 6 to 12 in, dimensions
and £0.003 in. in the 50 to 60 in. range.’

2. Mechanical Measuring Device. — A mechanical
measuring device consisting of three vertical posts
is envisioned, Long travel dial indicators would be
attached to these posts and parts measured in re-
spect to the post spacing. Vertical measurements
could likewise be taken.

3. Photographic Measuring Unit, — An adaptation
of aerial mapping and lofting as used in the aircraft
industry is envisioned, In this procedure a picture
would be taken normal to the part to be measured,
perhaps with a grid background. The picture would
then be projected on a flat surface and measured.
An accuracy of £0,001 in, is desired. This photo-
graphic technique should also be extended to include
stereoscopic pictures for information purposes.

4. Gages and Measuring Tools, — It may be de-
sirable to have available a group of gages for par-
ticular measurements, These may be ‘‘go or no-go’’
gages, plug gages, depth gages, micrometers, cali-
pers, etc,

5. Portable Gage Storage Racks. — It is felt that
any gage racks for storing gages, etc., within the
cell should be portable, so that definite areas will
not be required and they can be placed in available
space,

6. Crane Scale, — A dynamometer type crane scale
(0-10,000 Ib) is required. It will be used to check
part weights and to make sure that a piece being re-
moved has been cut free.

7. Radiation Instruments. — Detectors which give
the radiation level in the cells are required. A port-
able unit is desired for inside the cell. Other de-
tectors will be located in the operating and other
areas for personnel protection.

 

3 This system and others which have been studied are
reviewed in Sec 4.4,

 

 
 

E. Cell Service Equipment

The items listed in this category were intended to
cover the special features which are necessary to
meet hot cell requirements in addition to the gener-
ally accepted services.

These are listed as follows:

1. Shielding, — Adequate shielding is required
to handle the activity levels anticipated.

2. Decontamination. — Facilities are necessary
to wash down all internal cell areas, giving consider-
ationto a complete spray system capable of remote
operation,

3. Contaminant Holding System. — Provision
will be necessary for all wash water to be held until
it is sufficiently low in count to be disposed of, or
otherwise safely handled,

4. Illumination. — Several types of lamps will be
required, such as sodium vapor for general lighting
and mercury vapor for flood lighting, Lamp cooling
and ventilation are required in addition to accessi-
bility plugs for lamp changes.

5. Handling Equipment. ~ Provision must be
made to remove and replace the wall manipulator
shielding plugs, by means of a portable crane in
the operating area. This crane is also used to
handle master-slave manipulators when changing
them.

6. Crane Rails. —~ Both the main crane and the
overhead manipulator crane rails should be provided

 

4Described completely in Sec 5.

 

with swing-out sections to permit closing the main
doors of the main and intermediate cell, yet allow
direct travel of the cranes to the receiving bay.

7. Access Doors. ~ Personnel access doors to
both the main and intermediate cell will be required
from the ‘warm’’ areas.

8. Access Roof Plugs. ~ Special removable roof
plugs and means for handling them will provide a
cell of greater usefulness and enable it to handle a
wide variety of future work,

9. Shielded Cable Ways. — Adequate provision is
required for shielded cable ways, pipe tunnels, and
conduit paths to maintain the integrity of the shield-
ing, and to provide necessary drainage and decon-
tamination,

10. Lost Tool Transfer Schemes. ~ Provision for
bringing miscellaneous tools and samples to and
from the cell are required to reduce the need for
opening the large doors.

11. Miscellaneous Services. — Convenient outlets
will be required both inside the cell and in the oper-
ating area for 220-v ac, 110-v ac, air, water, intercoms,
etc.

12. Ventilation and Filtration System. — Contami-
nated cell air will be required to be filtered before
recirculating or being sent up the stack. Rough
filters which will hold the bulk of activity, chips,
etc., must be located inside shielded areas and
capable of remote handling and disposal. The air
cleanup filters must be accessible for remote han-
dling in case they become highly active during un-
usual conditions.

APPENDIX D. ABRASIVE GRINDING INVESTIGATIONS’

This memo describes two separate Inconel grinding
tests performed on two machines, one at a vendor's
plant and the second at the ORNL SF Machine Shop,
Bldg. 3044,

Avisit was made to the Ty-Sa-Man Machine Co. on
May 22, by Frank McQuilkin, L, W. Love, and the
writer to observe their cutting and grinding machine.
A sample piece of Inconel plate was provided for
them to cut off, The object was to learn more about
their cutting methods and its possible adaptation to
our hot cell requirements.

The person contacted was James L. Hensley, their
chief engineer, He gave us a short tour of the plant
in order to familiarize us with the type of machine
they build. Most of them are custom-built units with
rather large travels intended for specialized heavy
cuts on plate. In general, the wheels and motor are
mounted on a carriage which moves back and forth
across the work. Cross travel is provided with trav-
erse tracks, like an overhead crane. The machine
which was used for our test was a 40-hp machine
using a Manhattan type 714 wheel of 24“dia. The
wheel operated at 1560 rpm with a rim speed of 9800
fpm., Water cooling was used, The selection of this
wheel was made on the basis of grinding studies
Ty-Sa-Man Co. had recently completed for Interna-
tional Nickel Company. The maximum motor capac-
ity of 40 hp was not utilized, but by means of an
ammeter it was observed that about 15 hp was the
maximum power used during the cut which they
made. The plate was Inconel of 7“ thickness and
12” wide. The entire width of the cut was made in
2Y, minutes, including a preliminary scoring cut
about Ye" deep. These results indicate that grind-
ing could be adapted to hot cell use with good speed
and precision, but the type of mounting would re-
quire redesign. The motor is mounted overhead and
drives the wheel spindle through multiple V-belts.
The belts follow a general “LL” shape so that the
weight of the wheel and the spindle determines the
load on the cutting surface. This load can be varied
by means of counter weights. By oscillating the
wheel it was observed that no burning had occurred
at the edges of the cut. The finish is excellent,
and from the cutting rate it can be seen that this
method must be seriously considered in any tool
evaluation program,

 

Memo from A. A. Abbatiello to F. R. McQuilkin dated
May 29, 1957.

70

Further work should be done to determine whether
a spray of water would be permissible in the shell
area and whether the metallic particles would spread
contamination throughout the cell to an intolerable
amount, This study should determine whether this
contamination is serious enough to warrant the extra
cost of an air circulating and filtering system, and
if so this could be weighed against the reduction in
cell time which such a grinding method would permit.

It is the writer's opinion that abrasive grinding as
a basic cutting tool would be practical but would re-
quire a change in philosophy in regard to contami-
nation within the cell. Although opinions differ on
this point, it has been proven, especially in the high
level cells at 4501, that activity as spread by such
a grinding operation may be washed out by a direct
rinsing method, and more serious thought should be
given to this as compared to the extreme difficulty
of manipulating a drill or end-milling operation to
produce all the devious cuts which must be made.

It is true that such a grinding wheel would make
necessary longer cuts (because of arc length) in
order to remove specific sections of the reactor, but
by using a wheel of about 24” dia. the depth of cut
which this type would permit would make practically
every area of the shell accessible. This should be
particularly useful in the areas around the Na ex-
pansion joint, the pump barrels, and the girth cut.

In case such a design is to be built, Ty-Sa-Man
Co. have prefabricated spindles available which
could be used as a basic element. The mounting of
this spindle in our case is primarily vertical, with
an adjustment to permit the rotation of the wheel
through an arc all the way from vertical to hori-
zontal, The wheel mounting must also be arranged
in such a manner that the wheel can travel in the
plane of the blade, This means that the entire drive
would be mounted so that it would be on a radial
arm to permit travel of the wheel in the direction of
the cut. This is particularly important in cutting off
the NaK headers, since the wheel must be mounted
at a 45° angle. These machines are controlled from
a central push-button control panel which would lend
itself to remote operation,

During the discussion which followed, Mr. Hensley
suggested a method for mounting wheels in a cell
for easy remote removal and changing, This con-
sists of mounting a Stewart-Warner type magnetic
clutch on the spindle flange and using a steel
bonded wheel which would then be held against the
face by a magnetic force, Two pins mounted on this
surface would drive the wheel, yet would permit easy
removal of the wheel in the event of breakage or
other reasons for changing. It was his opinion that
in our case, where perhaps 5 hp might be used, we
might get by with dry wheels. For Inconel he sug-
gested a resin-bonded wheel,

A second grinding test was made May 28 on an
Inconel NaK header mockup using a type M-75 Stone
saw made by the Stone Machinery Co. of Manlius,

N. Y. This machine is located at the SF Machine
Shop at Bldg. 3044.

This is a manual feed radial arm saw. The piece
cut was an assembly of three concentric pipes (3%:
3”, and 2%" Sch. 40 Inconel) mounted and welded
at a 45° angle to simulate the NaK header. The part
was clamped in the table vise, and the wheel pulled
down through the work. It is estimated about 10
pounds pull was used at the end of the lever arm.
Several times the cutting was stopped in order to
remove the cut portions of the pipes, yet in spite of
these slight delays, the first cut was made in about

2 minutes and the second cut was made in about 1
minute,

These cuts were made dry with a Carborundum Co.
Aloxite wheel No, A-243B-T36 operating at 2520
rom. The wheel was 16" in dia. and %” thick.
Wheel wear was about Yo" on the radius for the first
cut and almost he" on the second cut.

The radial type mounting of this motor and spindle
would lend itself easily to the type of mounting out-
lined previously. An eccentrically mounted built-in
gear head gives a clean exterior with adequate depth
of cut using the 16” wheel. Maximum depth of cut
with a new wheel is about 5” with this arrangement.

With this dry grinding, the spread of particles over
large areas is apparent, and emphasizes the need
for decontamination studies previously discussed.

A comparison of the two grinders investigated to
date points to the advantages of the Stone machine
saw with regard to type of drive, power available,
type of mounting, and maneuverability. When design
work for the grinding fixture proceeds, the use of
the Stone machine saw should be considered.

APPENDIX E. HELIARC TORCH CUTTING '

Introduction

The evaluation of cutting methods for hot cell
use has covered drilling, end milling, wet and dry
grinding, ultrasonic, and electric disintegration, A
Heliarc torch cutting method which was recently
made available was tested on Inconel.

There are two specific applications for this tool,
First, a torch capable of remote manipulation is
desired for use in the hot cell to reach difficult
areas of a reactor, and second, in cutting apart the
ETU, a manually operated torch would expedite
access to reactor internal regions, which it is de-
sired to study before ART assembly proceeds.

Description of Heliarc Torch

The Heliarc cutting process is a high tempera-
ture constricted arc between the tungsten electrode
and the work. The molten metal is blown out with
a mixture of hydrogen and argon to form a kerf. An
auxiliary circuit is used for arc starting. It has
been used successfully in stainless steels, Inconel,
and aluminum. The inert atmosphere prevents the
walls adjacent to the kerf from hardening. The
torch is capable of sufficient control to permit weld
preparation of thick plates with the minimum of
machining, which, combined with its high speed,
make it highly desirable in fabricating nonferrous
alloys.

The equipment which was used for this test was
a model FSH-6 installed at the Lucey Boiler and
Manufacturing Corp., Chattanooga, Tenn, In their
installation the arc voltage was obtained with two
400-amp welders connected in series to hold a
minimum of 115 volts on open circuit. Gas flows
of 40-60 cth of argon and hydrogen are required.
The hydrogen is 20 to 35% of the total flow. A
minimum of 2 quarts of water per minute is required
for adequate torch cooling,

Test Runs

A type 302 stainless steel plate %" thick by
3 ft wide was cut through its full length in about
3 minutes, using the mechanized head.

Next, our piece, an Inconel plate bh" thick by
12" wide, was cut, leaving a small connecting
strip to indicate the width of the kerf, as shown in
Fig. E-1. This plate was cut in about 1 minute,

During this test the stainless steel plate used in
the test above was placed about 5" below the
Inconel plate. Sufficient energy remained in the .
cutting stream to pierce and produce a slot in the
stainless steel plate. Although all observers were
surprised, it was a welcome development because
a cut of multiple layers is desired for some appli-
cations.

The third test was on a section of three con-
centric pipes, 3%", 3”, and 2%", all Sch. 40
Inconel pipe. The cut was arranged for the axial
direction to permit a setup under the mechanized
head, which can only cut a straight line. The
torch successfully penetrated all three pipe walls
simultaneously. The rate of travel was about the
same as for the preceding cuts, about 1 ft per
minute. Slag and *‘icicles’’ were formed in large
quantities, but they were knocked off without too
much difficulty. See Fig. E-2. The molten ma-
terial which was blown out of the kerf solidified
on the opposite wall of the inner pipe, but did not
adhere. It was possible to raise one end of it
with a thin chisel, as may be seen in Fig, E-2,

Results

The results of this test indicate the following:

1. This type of cutting torch has high cutting
rates,

2. The control would be adaptable to remote hot
cell operation.

3. Large volumes of molten metal would be re-
leased into the reactor and hot cell areas, but the
harm which this might do is not obvious, without
better cold mockups and hot testing, Although this
slag is not too adherent, it will present a problem
merely to clear it away.

From these observations, it appears such a torch
would be a useful tool for both the ETU disassem-
bly and the ART. It may be considered versatile
and maneuverable in close quarters, but is probably
not a cure-all. Problems of arc starting and manip-
ulation under remote conditions will have to be -
worked out, The large quantity of molten metal
removed from the kerf will be detrimental regarding
activity spread.

In general, this torch appears to be sufficiently
useful to warrant its purchase. The first applica-
tion could be the girth cut on the ETU, which would
be a formidable job under conventional machining

techniques; for instance, using a boring mill and
standard lathe point tool. Grinding would also be
a suitable method for this cut.

It is recommended that this equipment be pur-
chased and development started on special tooling
and training personnel in its use. At the very
least, it may be looked upon as the ‘‘fireman’s ax’
type of emergency measure when all other types of
cutting devices still leave cuts necessary,

Acknowledgments

The idea of using this type torch was first pro-
posed by Mr. M. Bender. Arrangements for the use
of the installation at Lucey Boiler and Mfg. Corp.
for this test were made by Mr. Earl Woods of the
Linde Company in Knoxville, Tennessee, The co-
operation of Mr. R. C. Trane, Jr., Manager, and
R. S. Lane, Plant Superintendent, of Lucey Boiler
Corp. was most helpful.

 

 
 

APPENDIX F. ULTRASONIC CUTTING (ALSO CALLED MAGNETOSTRICTION)!

 

Evaluation of cutting methods for cu
which might be applied to hot cell conditions has
continued. Interlocked drilled holes, grinding, and
Elox cutting have been previously reported. Ultra-
sonic cutting was also considered because of its
potential value in cutting hard materials, but since
large amounts of Inconel would also have to be cut,
severing rates on Inconel were important. This
test was an evaluation on cutting Inconel only.

The equipment used was the Cavitron, made by
the Sheffield Corporation, of Dayton, Ohio. The
machine is located in Bldg. 2525, in the Central
Machine Shop Facilities.

The process may be described as a cutting action
produced by flowing an abrasive fluid over the sur-

ing Inconel

face to be cut and accelerating the abrasive par-
ticles by means of a high frequency (about 20 kc)
imparted by a ram which travels about 0,0005” and
is attached to the driving member. The fluid con-
taining the abrasive also serves to wash away the
particles removed in the cut,

The cutting tool was a narrow stainless steel
blade, %," x 1%" in section. The machine was
operated at frequencies of 19.5 to 20.5 ke with a
vertical load of 3 Ib 6 oz. The cutting fluid is a
suspension of water and 280 grain size boron
carbide, called Norbide, made by the Norton
Company. The Inconel sample was the same
piece as had been used for the Elox test, a partly
curved section about ¥," thick by 1%" wide.

Conclusions

1. After operating the machine for one hour, a
notch about 0.025 “ deep had been started near the
upper corners of the Inconel bar, which had con-
tacted the blade. See Fig. F-1.

2. The results are unsatisfactory on Inconel,
which is considered relatively soft.

 

"Memo from A. A. Abbatiello to F. R. McQuilkin dated
June 25, 1957.

3. This process is better adapted to the hard,
brittle materials, like quartz and B,C, which are
difficult to cut with ordinary cutting methods.
Under these conditions the low cutting rate is
acceptable for these hard materials.

Recommendations

Based on the above test, no action is recom-
mended on ultrasonic disintegration for hot cell
use, unless it is necessary to cut material which
is too difficult for ordinary means. Interior sur-
faces of the B,C tiles appear to be one of the
spots where the process could be applied, but it
is proposed that these tiles might be chipped to
expose these surfaces.

APPENDIX G. ELOX CUTTING’

The problems of severing active pieces during
disassembly require the development of a number
of cutting methods. Grinding, drilling, and Heliarc
torch cutting have been considered. One process
which has been suggested but has not yet been
evaluated is the Elox cutting process (also called
electrical disintegration).

An Elox machine was made available to us
which had been used for experimentally cutting
apart fuel elements. A test was arranged fo cut
Inconel plate in this machine.

The machine used is located in Bldg. 4505 in the
Unit Operations Section of the Chemical Technology
Division, and is a model M-500, serial 149. To de-
scribe this process simply, one might say that it
operates like a welding machine, except that the
material is vaporized by means of an electric arc
and washed away instead of fused. A current is
passed through the electrode, which can be of any
shape to make a particular cut desired, and then to
the work to complete the circuit. Usually, the en-
tire area to be cut is submerged; or it may be sprayed
with either a conducting oil or in our case a de-
mineralized water was used. The electrode wears
away at about the same rate as the material which
is removed in the cut. The process has the ad-
vantage of making any odd-shaped cut which can be
made using a plunge-type movement, and producing
a cut close to the dimensions of the electrode. The
material removed by the arc is vaporized into tiny
globules and is floated away by means of the circu-
lating fluid.

Tests Run

Four test runs were made, three of them using
Inconel, and the last one, as a check, was made
with stainless steel. The Inconel plate was about
1." x 1%" in section and was slightly curved. See
Fig. G-1. It was clamped into the vise and placed
below the solution level. The electrode was a
brass plate about 0.030" thick and was mounted
from a vertical head. The rate at which the blade
or electrode is advanced depends on a device built
into the head which automatically maintains the arc
gop. In the first test a cut of about J“ deep was

 

"Memo from A. A. Abbatiello to F. R. McQuilkin dated
June 20, 1957.

76

made in about 3 min. After this period, some errati
operation was encountered and the operation was
stopped without completing the cut.

The other end of the Inconel plate was then set
up and the test repeated using a new section of the
electrode. This time it was permitted to run about
9 min, but the depth of cut was approximately the
same as before with erratic operation during about
the last half of the period.

The first test was made with the test piece sub-
merged but no forced circulation. The second test
was approximately the same except that the circu-
lating pump was started and the liquid forced
across the cut section to remove the particles in
an attempt to obtain steady operation. This was
not successful.

The third test consisted of a hollow brass elec-
trode about %“ in hexagonal end section with a
%" hole through it. The object was to force liquid
through the electrode and thereby wash the particle
out from the arc area. In this test it operated for
about a total of 9 min, but again the last half was
erratic in operation and the depth of cut was only
about %,".

32

In order to determine whether the Inconel was

causing this difficulty, a fourth test was run using

 

 

Fig. G-1. Inconel Plate Cut by Elox Process.

 
the same hexagonal vertical electrode but the ma-
terial was changed to stainless steel. After about
7 min operation the depth of cut was about the
same (%,") as had occurred in the Inconel plate.

In none of the four tests was complete severance
obtained.

The conclusions which might be drawn from this
test are as follows:

1. The cut proceeds at a relatively slow rate but
makes quite a clean-cut edge, therefore would be
desirable for thin, light sections.

2. The electrode is consumed at approximately
the same rate as the cut is made.

3. The particles which are removed from the cut
are confined to the liquid solution, which might be
desirable for limiting contamination.

4, The erratic operation which was noted was
not fully explained. It may be possible to improve
the operations which were noted here, using the
following suggestions:

a) A wider electrode, perhaps he" thick, might
give higher current density and better alignment.

b) A higher velocity and better flow of water
through the gap might prevent some of the erratic
operation.

c) It is suggested that the manufacturer be asked
to tell us what was being done incorrectly in this
test, or whether there was something basically
wrong with this particular machine,

d) An electrode of trapezoidal section, wider at
the base, might be used to automatically increase
the clearance as the cut is deepened. The same
effect might be produced by applying an electri-
cally insulating paint to the side walls of the elec-
trode.

In trying to determine where this process could
be applied, it is apparent that submerging a com-
plete reactor in order to put the electrodes in a
submerged position is impractical, However, it
may be possible to use the Elox process in one of
the auxiliary hot cells. It could be used for the
removal of specific smaller specimens after the
major elements have been taken off the reactor,
especially in cases where the part is fragile and
sawing or grinding might damage the specimen
(such as the heat exchanger bundle). As a side
comment this method has been used at the G-E hot
cell at the MTR for severing their thin-wall fuel
elements. |t has been used successfully, but in a
discussion with Mr. Dave Durrill (in charge of the
G-E hot cell) he mentioned that they were no longer
using this process, but were shearing their fuel
elements instead,

Two other previous tests might also be noted
here, A piece of B,C could not be cut on an elec-
trical disintegration type machine, apparently be-
cause of insufficient electrical conductivity. How-
ever, a piece of Cuv-B,C was successfully pene-
trated using this method.

Sawing may also be used on Cu-B ,C but it is
impossible to saw B,C. The precision cuts made
with the electrical disintegration method make this
process attractive for Cu~B C in spite of its slow-
ness.

APPENDIX H. A COMPARATIVE

In hot cell operation, it is desired to compare
critical reactor parts before and after they have
been operated, To do this, photographic records
have been considered. One of the early systems
which was proposed was a grid projecting system
whereby a cross-section grid would be projected
on a spherical surface from an angle. The photo-
graph of this grid shadow on this spherical surface
would cause a contour to be produced. Any varia-
tion from the normal would cause the curved lines
to deviate from a circular arc. One problem with
this system is that it is too difficult to project a
series of lines on a surface with sufficient defi-
nition to make them readable to the accuracy re-
quired.

A system has recently come to our attention
which overcomes this objection. It has been de-

Photogrammetric Engineering. The system con-
sists of a wire grid placed close to the object to
be measured. A vertical light source at a 45°
angle from the side produces a shadow of this wire
grid on the surface being studied (see Fig. H-1).

A camera directly in front of the object to be meas-
ured photographs both the grid and its shadow, thus
the difference between the two lines as measured
in the photograph will give an indication of the
space between the grid and the contour surface.
Since the grid consists of a series of vertical
wires accurately spaced and stretched taut, it
represents a true grid, and by making the light

source angle 45° it is possible to directly measure
on the film surface the deviation between the verti-
cal line and its shadow.

This scheme might be adapted to cur require-
ments as follows:

A dolly would be built upon which would be
mounted the grid, camera, and the light source
arranged at three corners of a 45-90° triangle.
The front end of the triangle (at the grid) would
carry a bumper stop which would be adjusted to fit
the machining lugs of the shells, By aligning the
dolly in front of the reactor it would be possible
to make a photograph of the projected grid lines
and the grid in the manner used by Jackson. By
taking this series of photographs at each of the
lug locations, the general contour of the reactor
can be produced. |t would probably be impractical
to take in the area beyond the NaK connections,
but this might be adequate. These would be pre-
served, and a similar set of photographs could be
made after the reactor had been set up in the hot
cell, using the same rig. It would be possible to
move the rig by means of the crane and shield the
camera with a lead box up until the time the ex-
posure was to be made. The complete rig could
then be raised and brought into the auxiliary cell,
where the film could be removed and a new one
set, or change plates in the camera remotely,

Such a system would have the advantage of
being a totally self-contained unit capable of being
carried to the reactor as it was assembled and the
original record photographs made. The same unit
would then be available for use in the hot cell. It
does not require an extremely accurate camera, as
would be true with the photo-lofting process, since
the grid wire and its shadow becomes the item of
measurement,

As shown in Fig, H-1, the dolly becomes the
carrier and the mounting unit for the camera, the
light source, and the grid. The position of each of
these units is critical and therefore should be
fixed on the mounting device and retained. A level
in both directions should be added, so that all the
photographs taken would be level regardless of
slight variations in the floor. The base line pro-
duced by the lower edge of the reactor mounting
lug would be the point from which the unit would
be indexed. This device would be used to make
photographs of the reactor as it is assembled.

In the hot cell a similar arrangement using the
same points of reference on the reactor surface
would be used to get the second set of pictures.
The photographs could then be compared and dif-
ferences noted and measured. A correction may
be required for the possible shift in lug reference
point.

Briefly, this contour measuring system appears
to be a simplified version of photo-lofting which
could be directly applied to our requirements. |t
is particularly attractive because the entire de-
vice can be mounted as one unit, carried about
both during the reactor assembly and in the hot
cell. Its cost should not be excessive because
the camera need not be an accurate item and the
light source is merely a vertically aligned tube,
The grid consists of a set of thin wires arranged
on a framework, with the entire unit placed on a
structural steel dolly capable of being transported
and retaining the three-element relationship.

This scheme is submitted for consideration and
possible construction of a test setup designed to
evaluate it,

APPENDIX I. FLAME SPRAYED REPLICAS’

Preliminary trials to determine a suitable method
of making replicas were made using a rejected
Shell | as the surface to be reproduced. Scribe
lines were placed every 30° around the shell and
2" apart vertically. The scribe lines were located
with an accuracy of 0,001".

The first spraying trial was made at X-10 Metal-
lurgy with a metalizing gun assigned to Mr, H.
Inouye.

The first trial was made with aluminum wire.
Aluminum would not build up on the Inconel sur-
face. It was dislodged by the air blast of the gun
as fast as formed.

The second trial was with Spramold wire, a lead
alloy. The lead adhered readily and showed good
detail but could not be removed in a reasonable
thickness without bending. Some blistering of the
lead occurred during spraying, but thorough clean-
ing with acetone of the Inconel surface stopped the
formation of blisters,

The third and fourth trials were made with an
estimated 0.020” thickness of lead backed with
0.005" to 0,010" of aluminum. There was con-
siderable variation in thickness from point to point
on the surface due to the impossibility of judging
accurately, during spraying, the thickness already
applied.

The aluminum backing caused the replica to curl
away from the surface. While this facilitated re-
moval of the replica, it made impossible the accu-
rate measurement of distances between points on
the replica,

A sixth trial was made at the main Y-12 machine
shop with the cooperation of Mr, W. C. Collins.

In this trial the surface of Shell | was carefully
waxed and polished with Simoniz wax. Spramold
wire %” in diameter was used. An area covering
approximately 120° x 8" at the small end of the
shell was delineated with pressure sensitive tape
folded to produce a parting ridge about % high.
The area thus marked out was sprayed with the
Spramold wire to a maximum depth of 0.170“.
There was considerable variation in thickness,
with a minimum of perhaps 0,125”. The spraying
operation required about 25 minutes. The shell
heated up during spraying to an estimated 200°F.

Memo from L. W. Love to F. R. McQuilkin dated
April 23, 1957.

80

The replica and shell were allowed to cool to
room temperature before attempting removal of the
replica. The pressure sensitive tape (cloth backed)
was pulled away, which permitted the replica to
fall off. No prying or rough handling was required.
The reproduction obtained was excellent, There
were some blisters, which were thought to have
been caused by excessive wax. Fortunately none
of the blisters occurred on a scribed line.

The replica was then measured with a radius
sweep gage, with the following four results:

Radius of Radius of Difference
Location Shell Replica ]
(in.) (in.) (in-)
Station 7 (top) 3.407 3.4035 -~0.0035
Station 6 3.432 3.4445 +0.0125
Station 5 3.598 3.4108 +0.0128
Station 4 3.898 3.9109 +0.0129

Measurements of the 2” vertical distances be-
tween the circumferential scribed lines were meas-
ured on the contour projecting gage with the fol-
lowing results:

Inches
Distance from station 7 to 6 2.0000
Distance from station 6 to 5 2.0000
Distance from station 5 to 4 2.0006
Distance from station 4 to 3 2.0003

The sixth replica, prepared at the Y-12 machine
shop, is quite rigid and with reasonably careful
handling will not bend out of shape. The radius
measurements indicate that the replica was warped
somewhat either during spraying or while cooling.
It is believed that the lack of warping at the top
was caused by the flow of molten lead over the top
edge of the shell, which tended to hold the replica
to the shell at that point.

The operation of the metal spraying equipment
required considerable adjustment and trial before
satisfactory spraying could be accomplished, How-
ever, at neither X-10 or Y-12 had the operator a
previous experience in spraying lead.

 
A. A, Abbatiello and L. W. Love visited the
Osborne Equipment Company in Knoxville to try
the spraying of gypsum cement with Bondact
cement spraying equipment.

The equipment consists of a mixing gun in which
water and cement are combined and sprayed on a
surface with an air blast, a hopper for feeding the
cement into the air stream, a pressurized water
tank, an air compressor, and suitable hoses.

About 25 |b of Ultracal 30, a trade name of the
U.S. Gypsum Co. for a low-expansion gypsum
cement, was taken to Knoxville for the trial spray-
ing.

The Ultracal 30 was sprayed on a part of a re-
ject Shell I. One half of the shell was oiled with
30W lubricating oil applied with a rag in a light
to moderate coat. The other half of the shell was
not coated. Separating strips of plywood %" x Y "
were taped to the shell 180° apart to provide a

means of separating the two halves of the cast.

The equipment with which the trial spraying was
carried out was old, with an unsatisfacotry design
for controlling the flow of cement into the air
stream. At least it was unsatisfactory when used
with Ultracal 30. The equipment operated errati-
cally due to variations in the rate of flow of the
gypsum cement. The operator was unable to ad-
just the flow of water to correspond to the flow of
cement, with the result that the mix was either too
wet and flowing or too dry, which caused it to blow
away as dust. |t is estimated that about one-fourth

APPENDIX J. SPRAYING OF GYPSUM CEMENT!

   
 

of the 25 Ib taken to Knoxville was actually ap-
plied to the shell. The remainder was splattered
or dusted over the environs,

After a few minutes’ operation the Ultracal 30
hardened in the gun, which then had to be dis-
mantled and cleaned before work could continue.

The coating applied varied from he" to %

It is believed that a more uniform coating could
have been applied if the operator had been able to
give his attention to the spraying operation rather
than to continual adjustment of the equipment,

The replica from the oiled side of the shell was
removed without difficulty. There was clean sepa-
ration except for one spot about 1 sq in. in area,
This replica showed some detail but did not com-
pare in clarity with the flame-sprayed lead. The
surface was somewhat dusty.

The replica from the side of the shell which had
not been oiled was removed with somewhat greater
difficulty but was nonetheless removed without
breaking. This cast adhered over the principal
part of the surface, leaving an irregular thin coat-
ing of gypsum cement. This replica does not show
fine detail but does conform closely to the con-
tours of the shell. Both replicas are sufficiently
rigid and strong to withstand handling.

It was concluded as a result of this test that the
spraying of gypsum cements was not practical for
a hot cell operation, This conclusion was based on
(1) production of excessive splatter and dust,

(2) erratic operation of the equipment, (3) plugging
of the gun with gypsum cement,

It is recognized that (2) and (3) above could
probably be overcome with further trials or rede-
sign of parts of the equipment, but the final result
to be expected would not justify the time and

money required,
82

APPENDIX K. CAST GYPSUM CEMENT REPLICAS’

In order to evaluate gypsum cement as a replicating material, four types were ordered from the

U.S. Gypsum Co. These cements have the following properties as reported by the manufacturer:

Type Name Setting Time Setting Expansion Dry Compression Strength
of Cement (min) (in./in.) (Ib/sq in.)
Ultracal 30 25-35 0.0003 7,300
Ultracal 60 75-90 0.0002 7,300
Hydrocal B-11 20-25 0.0005 3,800
Hydrostone 20-25 0.002 11,000

The first cast was made with Ultracal 30. Into a box of suitable size a mix of 18%, Ib of
water and 50 Ib of Ultracal 30 was poured. A rejected Shell | with Lucite end plates was
pushed down into the box until it rested on wooden stops previously located. A second mix was
prepared of 129, Ib of water and 35 Ib of Ultracal 30 and poured on top of the first to bring the
final level up to the point where half the shell was immersed. Silicone Valve Seal ‘A’ was used
as the mold release agent. In addition, half the immersed area of the shell was coated with
sprayed lacquer. The cast was removed by striking the free side of the shell a few blows with a
hammer, using a block of wood to prevent damage to the sheil.

The replication was only fair in this first case. There were a considerable number of air
bubbles trapped in the cement on the underside of the shell, too much mold release agent was used
causing poor detail, and the shell apparently shifted slightly during the second pour.

It was decided that a different pouring arrangement was necessary. A mold box was prepared
so that the cement could be poured over the top side of the shell rather than immersing the shell
in the cement. Four replicas were prepared of Shell | using the four types of gypsum cement listed

above and the improved mold box. Results of these trials were as follows:

Memo from L. W. Love to F. R. McQuilkin dated May 27, 1957.

 

 
The estimate of dimensional reproduction was made visually with a scale marked in Ya" gradu-
ations. Appearance of the replicas indicates that in all four cases too much mold release agent
remained on the shell. The Dow Corning Valve Seal ‘A’ is too viscous and thus hard to wipe
off. It is believed that Dow Corning Mold Release Emulsion 35B, which has recently been re-
ceived, would improve the replication detail.

It is reported that D-C Valve Seal ““A’’ can be dissolved with methylchloroform but not many
other solvents. D-C 200 fluid, which is believed to be the base for Emulsion 35B, can be removed
by amyl acetate, gasoline, perchloroethylene, and trichloroethylene, among other solvents. There
thus appears to be considerable advantage to using Emulsion 35B. It should work also with the

flame-sprayed lead.

APPENDIX L, OPTICAL MEASUREMENTS THROUGH HOT CELL WINDOWS
(ZINC BROMIDE)’

One of the principal objectives in hot cell operations is the accurate measurement of parts by
remote means. Optical methods have been considered but have not been evaluated on their basic
accuracy. In order to clarify this point a test was set up at the Solid State Division Hot Cell in
Bldg. 3025, using available equipment.

The basic instrument used was a Gaertner Scientific Co. cathetometer No. 2832 borrowed from
the Solid State Division. A piece of accurately finished dowel pin 0.437" dia by 4” long was
used as the test specimen. To show the effect of surface reflection, one end was left shiny and
the other was painted with Dykem. An oxidized surface might have been a better nonreflecting
surface, however,

In order to get a comparison of the dimensions obtained with no window and then through the
window, a set of readings was first obtained with the cathetometer and the sample set up outside
the cell about five feet apart. The specimen was then brought inside the cell and the cathetometer
set up directly in front of and normal to the window. When these readings were completed, the
cathetometer was moved to test the effect of looking through the window at an angle. Two sets of
angular data were taken, the first being at an angle of 15° looking up at the specimen and the sec-
ond at an angle of 30° from the side. Several individuals were used to take different readings in
order to determine the possible variations which might be expected. The data are presented at the
end of this memo.

The conclusions which may be drawn from this test are preliminary, but are sufficient to
change some original concepts and to warrant further work.

1. An examination of the data indicates there is no marked difference in accuracy between the
readings taken with the specimen outside and those taken with the specimen inside the cell.

2. The reflected highlights from both the clear and darkened end of the sample tend to give
low readings. As the operator becomes more experienced in knowing what to look for, this error
becomes less. Oxidized surfaces would also tend to reduce this error.

3. Angular readings through the zinc bromide window do not reduce the accuracy, but the
angle increases the chromatic aberration. However, this effect appears tolerable if the telescope
used is limited to 3 or 4 power.

4. This system has an inherent disadvantage in that it is slow and requires pre-established
reference points. The points must be easily identifiable.

5. The results obtained with zinc bromide windows indicate such a measuring system would
be feasible if it were decided to use it.

6. Further checking to determine the limitations of such a system working through multilayered

lead glass windows appears as a next step, to check for effect of density and surface variations.

 

IMemo from A. A. Abbatiello to F. R. McQuilkin dated April 15, 1957,

 

 
7. It appears feasible for a good operator, with a little practice, to obtain readings of the order

of +0.000” to ~0.007" using this method.

Data Taken

The first set of data was taken outside the cell, with both sample and cathetometer set up

about five feet apart. Normal diameter of specimen is 0.437" as measured with direct reading

micrometer calipers. (Note: 0.437" dia = 11.07 mm as the cathetometer was calibrated in milli-

meters. All readings were taken in millimeters and converted to inches.)

APPENDIX M. OPTICAL MEASUREMENTS THROUGH HOT CELL WINDOWS
(EARLY DESIGN LEAD GLASS)’ .

The purpose of this memo is to report the results
obtained by measuring a piece of Inconel in a hot
cell through a lead glass window, The object was
to repeat the test made on the zinc bromide win-
dows and reported on April 15.2 The evaluation of
measuring through lead glass will determine the
feasibility of optical tooling instruments mounted
outside cell windows.

The same cathetometer as used for the previous
test was set up in Bldg. 4501 B cell, lower win-
dow. The window in this cell is about 20” square
and 3 ft thick. Unfortunately this window is one of
the first lead glass windows installed, and there-
fore its quality is not representative of present day
windows. However, for the purpose of this test it
was desired to make the conditions as severe as
might be met in practice to determine what the
upper limits might be.

The sample was a piece of %" Sch. 40 Inconel
pipe which had a dull oxidized surface finish simi-
lar to what is expected in our hot cell. The pipe
was mounted in a ring stand and placed in the cell.
The cathetometer was placed on the outside of the
cell window on a table. The pipe diameter was
0.831" -0,832" and was quite uniform, although
the pipe was slightly curved — about 24” radius.

Since the cathetometer is calibrated in milli-
meters, the conversion of the 0.832" diameter of
the pipe becomes 21.13 mm, and this is taken as
the normal reading for the pipe diameter. It will
be observed that in the data sheet the diameters of
the pipe as recorded will vary in location depend-
ing on which section of the glass area was used
when the measurement was made,

Measurements (Table M-1) were made in approxi-
mately five places. Position A was on the lower
right-hand corer (4" from each edge) of the glass,
perpendicular to the surface. Position B was on
the lower left-hand corner, also perpendicular to
the surface. Position C was approximately the
same as Position A, i.e., on the right-hand side,
but looking through the window at an angle of 15°
to the normal, Position D was taken from the left

side of the window (near B), looking at an angle
of about 22° from the normal, Position E is the
same as Position D except that it was lowered
4", and therefore this line of sight is parallel to
D but 4” below it, still 22° from the normal,

As in the previously reported experiment, several
observers were used to take readings in order to
determine the variations between individuals, The
conclusions which may be drawn from this experi-
ment are as follows:

1. The groups of readings which are taken
through the particular zone of the window will show
reasonable agreement (about 10,003").

2. Rather wide differences were found at the
different points measured, +0.007", + 0.020",
+0.013", 40.020”, +0.012". Since this window is
one of the first built, it is expected that it would .
have rather wide variations. A newer window
about 4 ft thick is on order but will not be de-

livered until about another month, If desired, the =
test could be repeated, but this is not felt neces-
sary.

3. These tests could be repeated from the newer
window, but it may be stated generally that meas-
urements through the lead glass will be limited in
usefulness to the long dimensions.

4. It will be noted that the angluar measure-
ments did not introduce the higher inaccuracies
which might have been expected, or the high chro-
matic aberration which was noted through the zinc
bromide windows. This may be partially explained
by the lights used in the two different cells. Less
chromatic aberration was noted in this window. The
type of light used is fluoride mercury vapor. For-
tunately, this effect will make it possible to use
higher power telescopes, if desired. (The test in-
strument was only 3 to 4 power.)

5. Another conclusion which may be drawn is
that in practically all cases the measurements
read oversize, whereas the previous measurements
through the zinc bromide windows were all under-
size. lt is believed that the basic cause for this
difference is the color of the finish on the speci-
men. The rather shiny surfaces on the specimen
tested in the zinc bromide windows tended to pro-
duce highlights which caused the observer to read
the lighter edge, which would result in a low read-
ing.

 
6. Because of these oxidized surfaces and also
because of the light colored background in the
cell, it was possible to establish the edge of the
specimen with good precision. [t may not be pos-
sible in all cases to duplicate this condition when
the work starts in the hot cell, but this method
may be an aid, that is, to provide a light back-
ground surface so that any darker object which
would be placed before it would produce a shadow-
graph type of image.

The general results of this test seemed to indi-
cate there is a possibility of using the Brunson
optical tooling bar or similar equipment for limited

applications from outside the cell wall, This is
not recommended for the small high accuracy di-
mensions. |t may, however, be suitable for the
large dimensions which are required across the
major reactor proportions. If the error which lead
glass introduces is a constant, a variation of
0.010" to 0,020” may be tolerated in the longer
dimensions.

Acknowledgment is made to Oscar Sisman and
George Parker for assistance in arranging for the
use of the 4501 cell, and to W. E. Brundage of the
Solid State Division for the use of the cathetom-
eter.

APPENDIX N. OPTICAL MEASUREMENTS THROUGH HOT CELL WINDOWS
(CURRENT DESIGN LEAD GLASS)!

The first in this series of tests measured the
optical qualities of a zinc bromide window in the
Solid State Division, Bldg. 3025, for the purpose
of taking measurements from outside, and was
dated April 15.2 The second test was done on
measurements taken through an early lead glass
window at the High Level Laboratory in Bldg. 4501
and was dated May 17.3 This memo, the third in
the series, presents the test data taken on one of
the new lead glass windows which have been pur-
chased for the High Level Chemical Development
Facility, Bldg. 4507, but have not yet been in-
stalled. The work was done while they were still
in storage at Bldg. 7005.

When the new lead glass windows which are to
be installed in the HLCD were made available to
us, a set of data was taken to compare this win-
dow with the earlier lead window previously re-
ported.

The window is 4 ft. thick, 20 in, high, and 36 in.
wide at the outside of the cell, It is composed of
the following pieces of glass, starting from the
outside surface: 1 piece of plate glass, density
2.5 g/cc, 1 in. thick; 5 pieces of lead glass,
density 3.3 g/cc, each 8 in, thick; 1 piece of lead
glass of the same density, 6 in. thick; for a total
of 46 in. of lead glass. The inside of the cell
window is covered with a piece of 1 in. thick non-
browning plate glass of 2.7 g/cc density. The
spaces are filled with a mineral oil to cut down re-
flections. These windows were built by the
Corning Glass Works at their Harrodsburg, Ky.,
Plant, and are shown on their drawing 12931-1480
and on ORNL drawing D-25357. Four of these
windows are available and one of them was select-
ed for this test at random,

The equipment which was used was the same as
that used previously, i.e., a Gaertner Scientific
Co. cathetometer borrowed from the Solid State
Division and placed on the front side of the win-
dow. A piece of Y in, Sch. 40 Inconel pipe with

a dull finish was placed on the cell side of the
window and mounted in a horizontal position,
Readings (Table N-1) were taken at five points
through the window. Three of them were normal to
the surface, at points A, 12 in. from the right edge
of the window, B, about at the center, and C, at

4 in, from the left edge of the window. All three
of these readings were taken at the approximate
horizontal centerline. Two readings, D and E,
were obtained at an angle to the surface, Position
D was at an angle of 25° from the normal entering
at a point 4 in, from the left edge, looking toward
the right. Position E was taken at a point about
12 in. from the right edge of the window facing the
glass at an angle of about 23° from the normal, but
looking toward the left,

Because these windows were located in a storage
area, the only available illumination was daylight,
A door open to the exterior of the building was
raised and the object to be measured was illumi-
nated by natural daylight.

Conclusions

1. As can be seen by examination of the data,
the dimensions obtained through this window are
better than any of those obtained heretofore, either
with the zinc bromide or through the earlier lead
glass window in Bldg. 4501. The results indicate
that there is closest agreement between all the
readings of any data taken to date. There were no
marked differences between any of the specific
points on this window as measured.

2. The deviations noted from the true diameter
were both on the plus and minus side, indicating
that these readings gave better dispersion about
the mean.

3. Because the cathetometer could not be fo-
cused on the longer distances (Positions D and E),
some parallax was encountered which could not be
removed (parallax is the apparent shifting of the
cross hairs on the image as the eye is moved
across the field of view and means the cross hairs
are not located at the exact focal point of the
eyepiece). A telescope designed for the range of
distance at hand would have avoided this handi-
cap.

trying to adapt the available equipment to this

test, the results are most encouraging. The test
setup was made and about 20 readings were taken
in a 2-hour period, which indicates that an ac-
ceptable rate for obtaining data is possible.

5. The available range of accuracy and repro-
ducibility using this system appears adequate to
justify its use, as determined by the 0.1 to 1%
change in dimensions expected as suggested by
the Power Plant Design Department. *

6. Since these readings compare favorably with
the first set of readings taken in air only (see my

 

4Erom personal notes of a meeting at 9201.3, Jan. 31,

1957

April 15 memo), it is apparent that the lead win-
dow has little effect and that we have reached the
accuracy obtainable with this type of experimental
setup. It should be noted that this test was impro-
vised from available equipment and that a larger
power scope with a longer focusing range would
have provided better results. However, in spite
of these minor difficulties it is felt that lead win-
dows as presently produced and indicated by this
example, which will be used at the HLCD, will be
adequate to give the type of measurements needed.
All the plus values averaged out to +0,0052 in.,
and all the minus values averaged ~0,0054 in,
The object which was measured was placed
about 2 ft inside the cell, i.e., from the window.

89
When the reactor is placed in the cell it is ex-
pected that it will be about 10 ft from the window.
Our equipment did not permit this long range test.
Had the equipment been available, which would
have focused properly at these longer ranges, it
would have been preferable to make this test to
determine whether the angular deviation varies as
the distance. However, since such small devia-
tions were found with the present readings, it is
expected that as the distance becomes greater the
variation will not increase appreciably.

APPENDIX O. ART DISASSEMBLY CELL (ADC) FACILITY CRITERIA"?

1. Introduction

Continued study and experimentation in the field of nuclear energy by the Oak Ridge National

Laboratory (ORNL) has progressed to the stage where facilities are necessary for handling

large, highly radioactive assemblies and disassembling these units to obtain engineering data.

1.1. Document Definition
These criteria outline the requirements for construction of an ART Disassembly Cell
(ADC) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In preparing the
drawings and construction specifications the prime consideration has been to acquaint
the Architect-Engineer (A-E) with general facility requirements without restricting his
normal freedom of choice as to engineering and construction details. The benefit of the
Architect-Engineer’s experience on similar structures, to amplify and improve the design
criteria, is solicited.

1.2. Location
The ADC shall be located on the site shown in Fig. 0-1. This site is within the X-10
plant security area.

1.3. Completion Considerations
Special consideration shall be given to the design and construction schedules to insure
transfer of the ADC to ORNL by June 1, 1958. Maximum use shall be made of standard
equipment and prefabrication to minimize procurement and construction time.

1.4. Special Considerations
Construction within the Laboratory is subject to certain special conditions covering
operations such as blasting. These conditions shall be included in the specifications.
information of this nature will be furnished by ORNL.
1.4.1. Provision for Additions

It is definitely planned that an addition will be made to the building, This addi-
tion may be equal to or larger than the ADC, Figure O-2 shows the proposed

 

location of this addition. The addition is not included in this design, except that
a study shall be made to determine the additional utilities required. ORNL will
collaborate in determining these requirements,

1.4,2. AEC Construction Requirements
The A-E will be expected to provide estimates and services as required to fulfill
AEC requirements as to bid evaluation, construction reports, and procedures.
Standard AEC construction requirements which are required to be a part of the
ADC specification will be furnished to the A-E.

 

pre liminary report by V. J. Kelleghan and F. R. McQuilkin dated December 20, 1956.

2.2.6.

Unloading Area

An area is required in front of the cell sliding doors where large equipment
trucked to the ADC can be unloaded and transported into the building. This area
is in effect a truck unloading dock.

Set-Up Area

This area is a hot (possibly radioactively contaminated) area. It is the staging
area where small tools and equipment to be placed in or removed from the cell
are prepared. Personnel going into and out of the cells will operate from this
area.

Personnel Decontamination Area

This is a locker room where contaminated clothing is removed. Personnel are
required to wash any contaminated dust, etc., from their persons before leaving
this area and entering the cold locker room,

Locker Room

A locker room where operating personnel can leave their clean clothing before
entering the hot locker room and donning their coveralls is required. It will also
provide toilet facilities for other personnel in the building.

Operating Area

This area is located adjacent to the cell, It is the working area from which the
disassembly tools and manipulators will be operated during disassembly. All
viewing of operations and measurements will be made from this area.

Office and Laboratory Area

The business of keeping track of the disassembly operation will be conducted

here. Any work of a minor nature involving need for laboratory equipment will

be handled in this area.

central steam plant, The A-E shall design the temperatures for the various areas

in accordance with good engineering practice. There shall be no temperature or

humidity control in the cell. The remainder of the building shall be air con-

ditioned,

2.4.1.1, Combination with Air Conditioner

With the entire building air conditioned it appears desirable to provide

the

air conditioning unit with a steam coil and in this way heat the

building.

2.4.2, Lighting

2.4.2.1, Lighting Requirements by Areas

1.

Entrance Doors

Incandescent industrial type fixtures, reflector type units, heavy
duty, weatherproof, located above doors and switched locally.

Incandescent and sodium vapor, industrial type diffusing fix-
tures, vapor proof, panel switched, 300 foot-candles total. In
addition, a mercury arc spotlight shall be provided at each
window. Special emphasis shall be placed upon making the
lamps in this area readily replaceable.
2.4.2.2, Emergency Lighting
An emergency lighting system is to be provided to supply low level
lighting in cells, stairs, exits, and other critical areas.
2.4.3. Ventilation and Air Conditioning
2.4.3.1. Basic Philosophy
It is intended that the flow of air leakage resulting from the pres-
sure levels within the building should be into the building and, within
the building, from uncontaminated areas to areas of higher contamina-
tion. In this way, the spread of air-borne contamination to cold areas

should be minimized. Temperature levels should be maintained such

2.4.3.2,

2.4.3.3.

that operators performing difficult disassembly operations with manipu-
lators will be in a comfortable environment,

Design Conditions

Areas other than the cells shall have approximately seven air changes
per hour, with the air migrating to the cell area. The hot cells shall
have approximately twenty air changes per hour and be at a greater
negative pressure than any other areas in the ADC, All of this air
shall be cleaned and exhausted to the atmosphere through a stack.
The A-E shall determine whether a new stack will be required or
whether an existing stack can be utilized, The cells shall be main-
tained under a negative pressure at all times to prevent radioactive
particles from migrating to colder areas. When the cell doors are
opened, an indraft shall result through the openings which prevents
radioactive particles from migrating to colder areas. The A-E shall

locate the filters in the cells for easy replacement with manipulators.

Cell ventilation shall be separately controlled so that it can be shut
off, if desired, without affecting the ventilation of the remainder of
the building. Downdraft ventilation is desirable in the cells. No
temperature or humidity control is required for the cells. The re-
maining areas shall be maintained at 78°F, 50% relative humidity
with control in accordance with good engineering practice.

Special Filter Considerations

No filters shall be used which are not of a replaceable type. All
filter installations should feature ease of replacement in the event
air-borne contamination deposits material with an appreciable activity

in the filters. Building occupancy and operations will be discussed
with the A-E.

2.4.4, Electrical Facilities

2.4.4.1.

2.4.4.2.

Building Service Entrance

The building power transformer or tie-in to existing lines shall supply
480-volt 3-phase 60-cycle power to the ADC. The A-E will size this
equipment to accommodate a 25% future load increase in the ADC.

APPENDIX P, SITE INVESTIGATIONS — REACTOR ENGINEERING HOT CELL FACILITIES +?

A survey has been made of the Bethel Valley and Melton Valley areas for a suitable site loca-
tion for the Reactor Engineering Hot Cell Facility (REHCF). Findings of this study and recom-
mendations by the survey team are reported below and on the attached tabulation and drawing.
This study was made by Mr. S. E. Dismuke of the Solid State Division and the writer of ARED
with the helpful aid of Mr. C. M. Carter of the Engineering and Mechanical Division's Civil Engi-
neering Section and Mr, W, E. Thompson of the Buget Office. The information and recommenda-
tions presented herein were reviewed in the Reactor Disassembly Planning Meeting on October 3,
1956, and this letter is being submitted with the endorsement of and at the instruction of that
meeting.

Assuming that the final plans will require an area approximately as indicated by the sketches
included in the recent proposal? to the AEC, the search was for a site that would ultimately
accommodate a facility approximately 190 ft by 320 ft or 60,800 sq ft, plus allowances for con-
tractor working and storage space. On a three phase construction basis, the gross area require-
ment would be about (1) 60,000 sq ft by July 1, 1957, (2) 70,600 sq ft by July 1, 1958, and 85,800
sq ft at such time that construction of the 20 “future’’ cells should be started. In addition to
space, the locations were studied with respect to utilities, services, center of reactor installa-
tions, center of hot cell operations, public roads, stack installations, soil conditions, accessi-
bility from 750Q area, contractor accessibility, current use of space, and planned future use of
the space.

Table P-1 lists findings for the eleven most promising sites studied. The approximate loca-
tion of each site is shown on Fig. P-1. A summary of advantages and disadvantages for each
site, along with recommendations, is given below, You will note that Sites 4, 8, and 11 are

recommended as suitable locations for the Reactor Engineering Hot Cell Facility.

Site 1 —~ 7500 area
Advantage: Adjacent to Bldg. 7503

Disadvantage: Remote from center of Laboratory operations, hot cell personnel, and
services; remote from hot waste drain system; on semipublic road; outside
ORNL security fence; if required, a discharge stack would have to be con-

structed

Recommendation: Not recommended for REHCF

Site 2 — 1500 area

Advantage: Readily available construction space

Recommendation:

Located near center of Laboratory operations, hot cell personnel, utilities, and
services, including hot drain; five existing cells could be incorporated in the

small building design

Site is much too small for a facility of the dimensions proposed; the sloping
terrain and subsoil rock conditions would affect the building usage and con-
struction cost; to replace Bldg. 3026, limited operations by two divisions would
be disrupted; if required, a discharge stack should be constructed, or possibly

To vacate site the Central Machine Shop Annex in Bldg. 2018 (scheduled to
move to Bldg, 2525 in spring 1957), Liquid Metals Laboratory operations in
Bldgs. 2011 and 2017, and Health Physics Laboratory Monitoring operations in
Bldg. 2012 all must be relocated and the buildings razed (this can be done in
three phases to correspond with new construction phases); the sloping terrain

on the north side would somewhat affect building layout and construction cost

Located near center of Laboratory operations, hot cell personnel, utilities, and

services, including hot waste drain; is readily available construction site

If required, a discharge stack should be constructed, or possibly limited use of
No. 3039 stack could be arranged; adjacent to former radioactive waste burial

ground No, 606B
Recommended for REHCF

Supplementary to the above summary we wish to amplify the findings as to requirements for

making the sites ready for construction:

Sites 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 11 are readily available and require relatively minor site preparation

work,

 
Site 4 in the 3500 area requires vacating and razing Bldg. 3550. Relocation of the lab and
office groups imposes certain problems that would have to be resolved, Where it might be reason-
able to vacate and raze the center (office) wing first and later remove the outer (lab) wings, the
present plans for such relocation call for transferring only a portion of the Bldg, 3550 activities in
calendar year 1959,

Site 5 in the 3000 area cannot be released for a building site until present commitments for the

Ral a project in Bldg, 3026 expire March 31, 1957, and after arrangements are made to relocate hot
cell activities in the west end of the building.

Site 8 in the 2000 area is the present site of temporary buildings 2011, 2012, 2017, and 2018,
As pointed out above, the Central Machine Shop Annex in Bldg. 2018 is scheduled to move to

Bldg. 2525 in the spring of 1957, The writer understands that the activities of the Health Physics

Laboratory Monitoring Group in Bldg. 2012 are now such that relocation problems would be minor

and probably could be worked out on short notice. Also, it is understood that the Liquid Metals
Lab, which recently occupied the former steam plant Bldgs. 2011 and 2017, will require the
building until the Metals and Ceramics Building is available in early calendar year 1960.

Present plans for Site 9 call for relocation from Bldg. 2506 of the paymaster's office in the
summer of 1958 and removal of the tool stores activity to an undetermined place at about the same
time. The building is subsequently scheduled to be razed for construction of a permanent plant
protection headquarters building as a fiscal year 1959 capital project.

Site 10 is scheduled for release as a permanent building area after the E & M Division offices
and drafting rooms are relocated in a second floor addition to be constructed on Bldg. 2525 as a

fiscal year 1959 project.
