Abstract

The Molten-Salt Reactor Information System (MSRIS) is a
computer-based file of abstracts of documents dealing with the
technology of molten~salt reactors. The file is stored in the
IBM-360 system at ORNL, and may be searched through the use of
established interactive computer programs from remote terminals
connected to the computer via telephone lines. The system cur-
rently contains 373 entries and is subject to updating and ex-
pansion as additional information is developed.

This document describes the nature and general content of
the data file, a general approach for obtaining information
from it, and the manner in which material is added to the file.
Appendixes provide the list of keywords currently in use, the
subject categories under which information is filed, and sim-
plified procedures for searching the file from remote terminals.

1. INTRODUCTION

Nuclear reactors in which the fissile and fertile materials are in-
corporated in molten-salt mixtures offer a route to long-term, economical
power that is both promising and distinctly different from other reactors
now being built and developed. Molten-salt reactor technology 1s not new,
having its beginnings in the aircraft reactor program in 1947. Thus,
there exists a considerable store of information which has been built up
over the years.! During most of this time, a formal system for information
retrieval was unnecessary, because the preponderance of the work on MSR
technology was done at one site (the Oak Ridge National Laboratory), within
a closely knit project organization. As other organizations began to par-
ticipate in this activity a need was created that the MSRIS was designed

to meet.
The MSRIS is intended to contain an up-to-date and readily accessi-
ble file of abstracts of selected documents dealing with all aspects of
molten-salt reactor technology. The purpose is to help searchers find the
information they seek by quickly identifying the documents that contain the
desired information and by displaying brief abstracts so the searchers can
decide which documents they need to read. The abstracts are stored in the
IBM-360 computer system at ORNL and various remote terminals can be used
for search instructions and output.*

The original data file was established over a period of time in 1971
and 1972 from information that was then available; an indexed compilation®
of the first 321 entries was published in 1971. Subsequent additions
raised the total number of entries to 373. This work was stopped when the
entire MSR program was discontinued early in 1973. With the reactivation
of the program (in 1974), the MSRIS was restored to its prior condition.
It is anticipated that the data file will be gradually updated and then
kept current as this program continues.

The sections which follow describe the kinds of documents and infor-
mation that are included in the MSRIS, general procedures for retrieving
information, and how the abstracts are prepared and indexed. Appendixes
provide the list of keywords, the subject categories, and detailed com-

puter procedures.

2. DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION STORED IN MSRIS

The kinds of documents included in the MSRIS are all those that are
generally available to the public. This includes ORNL reports (ORNL-xxxx)
and technical memoranda (ORNL-TM-xxxx) and similar reports from other
sites. Letters and internal correspondence (even though assigned an MSR
memo number) are not included. No ORNL-CF memo is included unless it
contains information of wide interest which is not otherwise available.
(There are some older ORNL-CF memos like this; if a forthcoming ORNL-CF
memo seems to fit this description, consideration should be given to

putting out the information in a more accessible form.) Books, journal

*
The MSRIS file is one of several "data bases" on different subjects
stored in the computer, all with consistent format and searchable by the
same programs and terminals.
articles, papers given at meetings for which reprints were made avail-
able; all are subject to inclusion in MSRIS.

Although its spectrum of documents is quite broad, the MSRIS is by
no means intended to include every single document published on molten
salts or even on molten-salt reactors.” Selection of documents from
among those published prior to 1971 was by a panel of experts from all
parts of the molten-salt reactor program at ORNL. The criterion was that
the chosen documents give an adequate description of all significant de-
velopments at least as far back as the initiation of the MSRE design in
1960. All externally available documents originating in the molten-salt
reactor program at ORNL since 1970 are to be routinely abstracted by the
authors and then filed in the MSRIS. The staff of the MSRIS (all part-
time) may also abstract significant public documents originating elsewhere
and add them to the MSRIS file.

The information that is stored in MSRIS for each document is 1llus-
trated by Fig. 1 which is a reproduction of a complete entry for one report
as 1t was retrieved from the file. Numbers have been added to identify the
seven information fields that are actually used in MSRIS and to provide a
key to the description of these fields below. It may be noted that three
additional labels — <AUTHSHIP>, <REFERENC>, and <KEYTERMS> — appear on the
illustration; these identify groups, or subsets, of information fields.
Use of one of these expressions (or its abbreviation) causes the computer
to deal with all of the information fields in that subset.

1. <HEADER >: This field provides an explicit identification for
every document or entry in the file, as well as some very general infor-
mation about the document itself. The first three characters (alphabetic)
define the primary category” into which the material contained in the
document falls. This is the category which best describes the main thrust

of the document, the greatest proportion of its content, or the purpose

x

Information on all kinds of molten salts (most of which are not suit-
able for use in molten-salt reactors) is embraced in the Molten Salt Data
Center of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

“The MSRIS category system is described later, in connection with
retrieval of information, and a complete listing of all categories is
provided in Appendix B.

CABSTRACT>In the fuel pump bowl 50 gpm of salt was sprayed through the cover gas

and into the salt pool. Effects included not only the intended xenon stripping
but several others which became the subject of investigations reported here.

The spray produced a mist of salt droplets, some of which drifted into the

off-gas line at a rate of a few grams per month. The resultant salt deposits
required cleanout at intervals of six months to a year. The stripper jets also

drove bubbles several inches into the salt pool, reducing the average density

and raising the actual level above that indicated by the bubbler level elements.
Some salt transferred into the overflow line, apparently as froth although
there was no evidence of persistent foam. Most of the bubbles driven into the
salt returned to the surface, but a small fraction was drawn into the

circulating loop. The situation was such that small changes in pump speed or
physical properties of the salt changed the depth of the bubble zone enough to
change the volume fraction of gas in the loop over the range from 0.02% to 0.7%.

for which it was written. Since the content of a document frequently
does not fit completely into any one category, other categories may be
listed elsewhere in the entry (see below). The remainder of the header
consists of a 6-digit number that identifies the entry. The first two
digits identify the year of publication and the last four are assigned
serially to entries of that year as they are added to the MSRIS file.
Topical reports normally are treated in only one entry; however, reports
covering a variety of subjects, such as MSRP semiannual progress reports,
may have an entry for each of the several subjects covered. In such
cases the header for each entry has both a different primary category and
a different identifying number. In addition to the header identification,
each individual entry is assigned a simple sequential number (beginning
with 1) to identify its position in the data file. Thus, the document
used in the example for Fig. 1 is number 321 in the data set.

2. <AUTHOR >: The "author" field is one of several fields in a
subset that carries the generic title of "authorship" or, in computer
terminology, <AUTHSHIP>. Since author is the only member of this subset
used in MSRIS, either designation could be used. This field contains the
names of all authors, where they are explicitly ldentified. Where in-
dividual authors are not identified, as in the case of MSRP semiannual
progress reports, the expression "(Staff Report)" is entered in the author
field.

5. <TITLE >: This is a unique field label, and the field contains
the full title of the document as it appears on the published version.
Section titles are used along with the document title for progress reports.

li, <PUB DESC>: The "publication description” is a member of the
subset of fields containing reference information, <REFERENC>. Again, only
one member of the subset is used in MSRTS. This field contains the name
of the organization that originated the document, the document number, its
publication date, and some indication of its size and breadth of scope
(numbers of pages, figures, and references).

5. <SUBJ CAT>: The "subject category" is one of two fields used in
MSRIS out of the subset generically identified as <KEYTERMS>. This field
contains, first, the primary category (from the "header"), and then any

other categories to which the document may have been assigned.
6. <KEYWORDS>: This field is the other member of the "keyterms"
that appear in the file. The most important, or most relevant, keywords
appear at the beginning of the field, and each is preceded by an asterisk
(*). All of the keywords that appear in the file were selected from the
list given in Appendix A; however, some of the keywords in that list may
not yet have been used. The list is subject to revision as the infor-
mation file expands.

7. <ABSTRACT>: This field contains the text of the document abstract.
Often it is the same abstract that appears at the beginning of the document

itself, but this is not a requirement.
5. SEARCHING THE DATA FILE

The MSRIS file is stored in the memory of the IBM-360 computer system
at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Also stored there are the programs
that are needed for searching the file. Wide access is provided through
various kinds of remote terminals, including Teletype, IBM-2741, and NOVAR
terminals, which can be connected through the telephone system to ORNL's
IBM-360/75. The file may be used freely by ORNL staff members and outside
organizations who have access to the ORNL computing facilities.

The MSRIS file is only one of many (32 at the present time) in the
ORNL computer that can be searched by the ORLOOK program.®> This program
was designed to be quite versatile, providing many options for searching
these files, and, in fact, is so versatile that learning to exercise all of
its potential would require considerable time. We believe, however, that
the needs of most users of the MSRIS will be satisfied by a few options
that are relatively simple to learn to use. A discussion of the equipment
and programs and step-by-step procedures for using them with MSRIS are
given in Appnedix C. Additional details may be found in Ref. 3. That
which follows is a discussion of the basic logic and general procedures
that are involved.

If one wishes to sift the file to find all records on a chosen sub-

ject, the best way 1s by subject category, by keywords, or by some
combination of the two. Of course, if one is looking for a specific
reference and has some clue, such as the name of one of the author or

the report number, these can be used to narrow and speed his search.

Searching by Keywords

 

The current list of keywords for MSRIS is given in Appendix A. A
few have not yet been used and so do not appear as keywords in the com-
puter file. Others may appear in many separate records. (The ORLOOK
program refers to the filed material for each document as a "record".)

At the moment there are 373 records in the MSRIS file.

A searcher could select one keyword that most nearly identifies the
subject in which he is interested, and look at all records having that
keyword. But usually a single keyword fetches more records than a person
may have time to examine. So one narrows the search by specifying more
than one keyword. There is more than one way to go about this. One could
start by selecting a set of several keywords that he feels should define
precisely what he jis interested in, and retrieve only those records that
include among their keywords all those in the specified set. The other
way would be to narrow the file in stages; first to those records having
the one or two most important keywords, then, from among these, the rec-
ords having the next most significant keyword; and so on. Finally, the
file would either be narrowed to the specific subject of interest or con-
tain so few records that the searcher could afford to have them all dis-
played for his examination. (The conversational program tells the searcher
how many records he is dealing with at each stage in his search.) The
first way is quicker, but runs the risk of omitting some records that may
be of interest, but might not have been given every one of the keywords
in the searcher's set. (When searching one should remember the human ele-
ment; that is, that the person who assigned keywords to the document in-
evitably viewed it from a standpoint different from that of the searcher.)

Sometimes it may prove useful to use the option of discriminating
against documents having some keyword or other feature. For example, it
may be desirable to examine all pertinent records other than progress

reports. This procedure is also explained in Appendix C.
Subject Categories

The subject category system is like a set of 14 large file boxes,
each containing several smaller boxes in which the records are stored.*
The 14 large boxes correspond to the 14 broad areas or first-order cate-
gories listed in Table 1. As shown in Appendix B, all but two (D and N)

are further subdivided.

The way the subject category system works is illustrated in Fig.

with any aspect of the MSRE. A document that is essentially a review of
all aspects of the MSRE would be tagged with the designation MXX and be

put into a box with all other comprehensive documents having this tag.**

It may be noted that, in effect, duplicate copies of records may be
stored in more than one box, since many records are assigned both a pri-
mary category and other categories.

Documents dealing with MSRE design go into box MA. Those covering design
of many or all parts of the MSRE are tagged MAX and go into the box so
designated. Documents dealing only with the design of specific parts of
the MSRE are tagged MAA, MAB, etc., as appropriate,and go into separate
boxes. Documents on MSRE construction, operation, etc., are similarly

sorted.
4, PREPARATION OF INFORMATION FOR MSRIS

For each document that is to be included in MSRIS, the required in-
formation is assembled in the form shown in Fig. 3. The material is, in
many respects, the same as that discussed earlier in the description of a
representative entry, but it has been rearranged to facilitate its prep-
aration. Whenever possible, this information is supplied to the MSRIS
staff by one of the authors when the document 1s published. Preparation
of the computer entry and insertion into the data file then follow rou-
tinely. The following discussion of the information items is keyed to
the numbers beside the example in Fig. 3.

1. Authors: List all authors, last names first, initials, no
punctuation except +.

2. Title: Give the complete title as on the published document.

3. Originating organization: Use a brief form of the name, but do

 

not abbreviate to the point of being cryptic; for ORNL, use the form
shown.

Lk, Reference information: Generally this includes document identi-

 

fication, date of publication, and number of pages, figures and references.
Formats for various kinds of documents are illustrated below.

5. Abstract: Guidelines for abstracting are given below.

6. Keywords: These are to be selected from the MSRIS Keyword List
in Appendix A.

7. Proposed keywords: If an author or abstracter feels that a key-
word 1s needed which is not in the MSRIS Keyword List, he should list it

on a separate line for consideration when the list is next revised.

Format for Reference Information

 

The "reference" line (item 4 in Fig. 3) not only gives the information
needed to locate or to order the document, but also gives clues as to how
"meaty" it is (how many pages, figures, and references are included).

Examples of reference lines for various kinds of documents follow:

Abstracts

An abstract may be "indicative" or "informative" or a combination.
A purely indicative abstract simply lists or describes the contents of a
document, the aim being to do so sufficiently well for a reader of the
abstract to decide whether or not to take the time to look at the docu-
ment itself. An informative abstract, in principle, conveys the major
factual results of the document in sufficient detail that most readers

would not find it necessary to examine the document itself. Insofar as
15

is practical, abstracts for the MSRIS are informative. Numbers that re-
quire lengthy explanation and qualifications to be meaningful (fuel-cycle
costs, for example) are avoided, however. Some documents, such as prog-
ress reports and review articles, which cover a wide range of topics, lend
themselves only to indicative abstracts. In most other cases, an actual
abstract will probably tend to be a combination of indicative and infor-
mative.

Whether indicative or informative, the abstract should be written
clearly and concisely so as to be quick and easy to read. There is no
fixed limit on MSRIS abstracts, but few should exceed about 200 words in
length. Having all abstracts as succinct as possible is a great advantage
to the user of the file; great enough to warrant special efforts on the
part of the writer. In writing an abstract, one should first of all jot
down the items of information that he wants to include. Then he should
draft the abstract, using direct, concise sentences. Next the writer
should edit his draft to eliminate superfluous words and, if necessary,
selectively cut the content to get the length down to about 200 words.
Finally, he should critically reread his abstract to make sure that each
sentence 1s still complete and clear and that the most important infor-

mation is still included.

Choice of Keywords

The MSRIS is intended to help anyone seeking information on a chosen
subject to find abstracts of all documents containing information pertinent
to that subject. Without any knowledge of report titles, authors' names
or the like, he should be able to pull the right abstracts from among a
multitude of others and be confident that he has not missed any essential
information. The keyword index is a mechanism designed to facilitate this.

Each entry in the MSRIS includes a set of keywords chosen from the
MSR Keyword List which appears in Appendix A.* In assigning keywords to a

 

"It may be desirable for the published document itself to carry some
keywords not included in the MSRIS list. For example, "molten-salt reac-
tors" is a very important tag for MSR documents in any broader information
system, but it would be superfluous in the MSRIS since it would appear on

almost every entry.
1k

document, the reviewer or author should ask himself, "If a user wanted
this particular abstract, under what set of keywords would he ask the com-
puter to search?" As many keywords may be used as is necessary to fully
define the contents of the document. (This varies widely, averaging
roughly a dozen.)

The person preparing an MSRIS entry may list keywords in any order,
but should place an asterisk immediately before each of the most important
keywords. When the computer input is prepared, these will be placed at the

head of the list so they can be seen at first glance.

Assignment of Categories and Accession Number

In addition to the information shown in Fig. 3, each entry in the
MSRIS file contains an accession number and category identification. The
accession number follows routinely from the publication date of the docu-
ment and its order of processing. The categories are assigned by the MSRIS
staff on the basis of suggestions made by the abstractor of the document.
Suggestions should be provided both for the primary and any other catego-

ries that may be appropriate.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF MSRIS FROM AN
INTERACTIVE COMPUTER TERMINAL

Searches of the MSRIS file may be conducted by simultaneous users
from teleprinter terminals connected to the ORNL central computer through
the public dial telephone system. These searches are carried out by the
computer program, ORLOOK, which has access to a number of other analogous
files. ORLOOK, in turn, is only one of many computer procedures that can
be used from remote terminals through the computer Time Sharing Option
(TSO). Thus, the prospective user of MSRIS must:

1. Establish a telephone connection to the computer.

2. Gain access to TSO by appropriate user identification.

3. Invoke the ORLOOK procedure.

4. Select the MSRIS file.

Upon completion of the search, the user must:

1. Terminate the ORLOOK session.

2. Sign off from TSO.

%. Release the telephone connection.

In preparation for an initial session, the user will need first to
gain some understanding of distinctive characteristics of the terminal

available to him as they relate to operations desired.

Obtaining Terminal Connection to Computer

For purposes of these instructions, terminals may be considered to

fall into two general classes:

Class I: IBM compatible-15 Char. /Sec., Upper and Lower Case
(IBM Model 2741, NOVAR Model 5-50, ete.)

Class II: Teletype compatible

a. 10 Char. /Sec., Upper Case Only
(Teletype Models 33 or 35, etc.)

b. 30 Char./Sec., Upper and Lower Case
(Teletype Model 37, G.E. Terminet
Model 300, I/O Devices Model 100,
Tex. Instr. Model 700, Beehive CRT
Model IA, etc.)
34

For Class I Terminals (IBM compatible), the following steps are

 

required to obtain a telephone connection to the computer:

1.

In preparation for typing messages to the computer, the user must
recognize the difference between the numeric character "1" (key
number zero on a standard typewriter keyboard) and the alphabetic
character "1" (key number 34) which is often used as a 1 in
typing. Care must also be taken not to confuse the zero numeric
key (number 35) with the alphabetic "0" key (number 33). Of the
various print balls available, IBM selectric typewriter, No. 527
(Waterloo correspondence) should be used on most terminals to
obtain a character set appropriate for the computer system em-
ployed for MSRIS.

See that the telephone coupler is turned on and its selector
switch is positioned to "HALF DUPLEX" (labeled "H.D.," or "COPY"
on some models).

Dial 3-1021 or 3-1041.* Following ring, listen for a steady high-
pitched tone, then place the telephone handset firmly in the
cradle or coupler, positioning cord-to-cord. (It is assumed here
that an acoustic coupler 1s used; otherwise the user should check
with the terminal custodian for variations in procedures.)

Turn on the terminal. If the coupler or.teleprinter is equipped
with a "CARRIER" or "XMIT" indicator light, it will illuminate to
show that connection has been made to the computer. The user may
now proceed to give his identification to initiate searches for

documents in the MSRIS as will be explained.

For Class II Terminals (Teletype compatible), the steps to obtain

 

telephone connection to the computer are similar to those given for Class

I, with a few exceptions, as follows:

1.

Characters printed by most terminals in this class are fixed to
the standard set for Model 33 teletypes. Some function keys, such
as those labeled "CONTROL" and "ESC" are not used with MSRIS, so
they will not be explained here.

*

All telephone numbers given here are in-plant extensions. For au-
thorized user connection by FTS lines, dial (615) 483 followed by the
last four digits of the extension.
35

2. Same as 2 above.
Dial 3-1011 for 10 Char./Sec. teletype-compatible terminals.
Dial 3-1051 for 30 Char. /Sec. teletype-compatible terminals.
Upon hearing the steady high-pitched tone place the handset
in the coupler as in 3 above.

4. Turn on the terminal by positioning the LOCAL/CFF/LINE switch
to "LINE."

Logging On and Off for MSRIS
(See Example 1)

 

After obtaining a telephone connection to the computer, as described
sbove, the user should proceed, without unreasonable delay to "log on"
and then invoke the ORLOOK procedure from which the MSRIS file can be se-
lected. In applying the instructions, given below, care must be exercised
to type the statements exactly as shown, including spaces. The one ex-
ception to this rule is in the use of upper case and lower case alphabetic
characters. In this Appendix, we have chosen to show messages typed by
the user and responses from the computer in upper case characters to dis-
tinguish them from the remainder of the text. However, if the user's
terminal has both upper and lower case alphabetic characters, user input
may be typed in all upper case, all lower case, or any combination thereof,
with due consideration for non-alphabetic characters that may not have
equivalent upper and lower case forms. In addition, computer output
through such terminals will appear with the usual mix of upper and lower
case alphabetic characters,
1. Type LOGON, and press RETURN. (In all cases, after typing the
required characters, the user must press the RETURN key to trans-
mit the data to the computer. In all subsequent instructions,

proper use of the RETURN key will be assumed.)

NOTE: With IBM-compatible terminals, if a wrong key is struck,
use BACKSPACE and strike over to correct the error; with teletype
compatibles, use BACKARROW, which is obtained by holding down the
SHIFT while striking the alphabetic O key.
36

The computer responds to LOGON with a set of characters identi-
fying the job and the request ENTER USERID-. The user may then
transmit the 3-character user identification (e.g. XXX) as as-
signed by computer center personnel.

When the USERID is accepted, the computer prompts the user to
ENTER PASSWORD FOR X3XX-. The user may then enter a 3-character
password, also assigned by computer center personnel.

If the password is also acceptable, the computer responds with:
XXX LOGON IN PROGRESS AT (time) ON (date), followed by any current
bulletins to TSO users and a listing of any special procedures
specifically cataloged under XXX. A final message, READY, indi-
cates that the user now has gained access to TSO and the computer
is ready for action.

The ORLOOK procedure is then invoked by simply transmitting the
word ORLOOK. The computer response is then the date, time, any

user messages, and the question:
DATABASE PUBLIC/PRIVATE/OTHER/ STOP?

The proper user response to lead to use of MSRIS 1s to transmit
the word PUBLIC.

The computer responds by typing a list of the number of each data
FILE and the title of the associated DATABASE. (Example 1
presents only part of the total listing. This listing, and any
other message being transmitted by the computer, may be interrupted
by pressing the ATTN key on IBM-compatible terminals or the BREAK
key on teletype terminals. The computer will then proceed to the
next step in the procedure that is in effect. The exclamation
point in DATABASE #6 indicates that the message was interrupted.)
Upon completion, or interruption, of the ORLOCK list, the computer

requests:
SELECT FILE #:

and the user, noting (or knowing) that the Molten Salt Reactor
Information File is item #4, types simply

4
37

The computer then responds:
4 MOLTEN SALT REACTOR INFORMATION FILE

ORLOOK READY

The user may now conduct selective searches for molten salt
reactor publications through various avenues of approach as will
be described. The period (.) on the last line of the computer
response is the ORLOOK system's indication that it is the user's

turn to transmit a command.

Upon completion of a session the user must release the ORLOOK pro-

cedure and "sign off" from TSO. The procedure, also illustrated in Ex-

ample 1, is as follows:

1.

At any time that ORLOOK is ready to accept a command (as indi-

cated by the period), simply transmit the command:
STOP
The computer responds with the message:
END ORLOOK SESSION

plus an indication of the computer time used and the present time.
Since the user is still in the TSO mode of operation, the com-

puter then transmits the TSO message:

READY

to indicate that another procedure may be invoked. The user then
transmits the command:
LOGOFF
to which the computer responds with
XXX LOGGED OFF TSO AT (time) ON (date) +

Finally the user must hang up the telephone handset or otherwise
sever the telephone connection. It is important that this be
done in order not to hold open one of the computer communication

lines.
38

Elementary Search of the MSRIS File
(See Example 2)

 

Having selected the MSRIS file, searches may be conducted for docu-
ments containing specified subject matter by typing LOOK* commands which

take the general form of:
LOOK '"vveerevnsnonss!

where words describing the subject matter are placed between the single
quotes. Always follow primary commands, such as LOOK, by a space. (The
elementary commend, as here written, can be given a number of optional
modifications for more refined searches which will be explained later.)

To each such command the computer responds with a period. The user may
then supply additional commands or request execution of the commands that
have been given. To initiate action on a LOOK command or a series of such
commands, the user must type END, and the search will be initiated.” In

the initial search, the computer responds:

SEARCHING SUBSET NO. O

After a pause, that varies in length depending on the size of the file
and how busy the computer is at the moment, the following response will be

received:
. +. .DOCUMENTS IN FILE
ANSWERS IN SUBSET NO. 1
. . DOCUMENTS IN RESULT

where the first blank is the size of the whole MSRIS file, and the second
blank gives the number of file entries found to contain the subject matter
specified. (The search is conducted without any distinction between upper
case and lower case characters in subject matter.) Usually, the second
number is large, so subsequent LOOK commands are entered to refine the

search further, before asking the computer to LIST the findings. Answers

*
A glossary of frequently used ORLOOK commands is presented later in
this appendix.

XK
Action on most other commands is automatically initiated when the
command is entered.
29

will be collected in SUBSETS 1, 2, 3, etc. It is important to emphasize
here that each successive search is automatically applied to the most re-
cently isolated subset file unless the user enters the command SUBSET fol-
lowed by a number. For a new search against all of MSRIS, enter SUBSET O.
At any time that the computer provides a period, the command LIST can be
given to cause the last acknowledged subset to be typed out on the terminal.
(The local printout can be interrupted before completion by pressing the
ATTN key on IBM compatible terminals, or the BREAK key on teletype compat-
ible terminals.) For large listings, it will be preferable to give the
command PRINT rather than LIST, to produce printouts on a high-speed line
printer at the computer center for subsequent delivery by courier. As will
be shown later, the LIST and PRINT commands can be given optional modifiers
to select portions of subsets to be produced in any order that may be de-

sired.

Selective Search for Documents by Field
Iebels and Selective Print
(See Example 3)

 

 

From the last example, it will be noted that each MSRIS file entry has
labels that define fields for each reference. Searches may be conducted,
(and listings can be made) according to fields or combinations of fields.

The labels actually used and their abbreviations are as follows:

Label Abbreviation
HEADER H
AUTHOR AU
TITLE TT

PUB DESC PU

SUBJ CAT SU
KEYWORDS KE
ABSTRACT A

In entering a search command, labels must be enclosed within pre-
scribed delimiter characters. For the IBM-compatible terminals (with

Waterloo correspondence print ball) the command will have the form:
.LOOK <AU> = 'TALLACKSON'

where the delimiter symbol "<" comes from pressing the SHIFT and striking
Lo

the first key on the top row and the ">" symbol comes from SHIFT and

striking the last key on the second row. (If the Waterloo correspondence
print ball is not used, the characters will usually print as "1" and "1/4"
respectively.) With teletype-compatible terminals, the delimiter "<" is
obtained by holding down the SHIFT key and striking the comma key and ">"
is obtained with SHIFT and the period key. Where searches are delimited
by labels, only the designated fields will be searched, whereas without
labels every word of the text is searched, which takes more time to ac-
complish.

The LIST or PRINT command may be given modifiers to either limit which
fields of a reference are provided, or to change the sequence of the fields.

Such a command takes the form:
. LIST AU,TI,A

where a space must follow the primary command and modifiers are separated
by commas. A command in this form will be applied to the preceding subset

that has been isolated, unless a reference number is given in the form:
.LIST 8,AU,TI,A

This will give the AUTHOR, TITLE, and ABSTRACT for reference number 8 (the
eighth sequential reference of the entire MSRIS file and printed as ### 8
HHA) -

Searching by delimited fields and listing or printing by delimited
fields are independent of each other, so they can be mixed as may be

desired.

Searching by Logical Combinations
(See Example 4)

 

To achieve more efficient searches for MSRIS documents, the elementary
LOOK command may be given sharper focus by expanding to one or more of the

following forms:
(a) .LOOK 'X' and 'Y'

.END
hl

This combination will find references containing both 'X' and 'Y'. (If
"and" is omitted in this command, viz., LOOK 'X' 'Y', it will get the same
result.) From one to four search items may be specified. Note that for

the combination used in Example 4, only one document was found in the data

file.
(b) .LOOK 'X'
.LOOK 'Y'

. END

This combination will find all references in which either 'X' or 'Y' occurs.
Up to ten LOOK commands may be entered, and they may contain single or mul-
tiple search items. In the example, 35 documents were found when the same

two keywords were specified in the OR format.
(e) .LOCK 'X'
.LOOK NOT 'Y!
.END

This format will collect references containing the search item 'X' but not
containing 'Y'. As many as ten LOOK commands may be specified with NOT
preceding the search items in addition to the ten allowed without NOT spec-
ified.

In these combination commands, individual search items may be given
label delimiters confining the fields to be scanned, as in this example,

or they may be left unlabeled. For instance,

.LOOK 'HEAT TRANSFER'
.LOCK NOT <AU> = 'MCCOY'
.END

will find references that contain, in any field, the words 'heat transfer’

Correcting Errors in Search Commands

As the user learns to formulate increasingly complex commands to
achieve efficient searches, the likelihood of making errors will become
greater. Most such errors can readily be corrected, employing conventions
available within ORLOOK. At any point during a session between LOGON and
LOGOFF, miskeying can be remedied by the BACKSPACE (or BACKARROW on tele-
types). While in the course of typing a LOOK command before RETURN has
been pressed, that line can be entirely deleted by striking the @ key. If
it is desired to eliminate an immediately preceding LOOK command, type
CANCEL and press RETURN. If it is desired to eliminate an entire series
of LOOK COMMANDS, type CANCEL ALL, and re-enter the desired commands. The
ATTN key (BREAK on teletype) may be employed to interrupt any computer

operation and return control to the user.

Efficlent Search Strategies

Before initiating a terminal search for MSRIS documents, a user should
select a strategy most likely to achieve his objective accurately and rap-
idly. Taking full advantage of interactive capabilities, the usual ap-
proach will involve entering an initial LOOK command describing the gen-
eral area of interest to obtain SUBSET #1 against which file of reduced
size subsequent searches may be directed. Without returning to the com-
plete MSRIS library (SUBSET #0), he may proceed to: (1) browse through
that collection of references to obtain an overall idea of information
available on selected topics; (2) locate a set of documents to generate a
bibliography; or (3) make a definitive search for a specific publication

or publications.

Browsing (See Example 5)

To illustrate strategy for browsing, let us assume the user wishes to
discover what documents are available on properties of Hastelloy N and
modified Hastelloy N. Entering the command LOOK 'Hastelloy N', although
permissible, would cause the computer to painstakingly examine every line
of the MSRIS file looking for this string of characters and would, of
k3

course, collect in a subset a large number of references, many of them
irrelevant. So, a preferable beginning would be made (observing from the
MSRIS subject categories list that category FB denotes "Hastelloy N" and
FC denotes "Modified Hastelloy N") by typing:

.LOOK <H> = 'FB'
.LOOK <H> = 'FC'
.END

As SUBSET #1, the computer would combine the references from the FB
and FC categories and indicate the total number found. This group of
references could then be explored with further LOOK commands to determine
what documents include information on specified properties.

When the topic to be browsed does not fall into an MSRIS subject cate-
gory, an initial search command employing some other delimiter or combina-
tion of delimiters may be employed to obtain a representative SUBSET #1.
For instance, to explore outside literature collected on "heat transfer,”

a search might begin with:
.LOOK <KE> = 'HEAT TRANSFER'
.LOOK NOT <PUB> = 'OAK RIDGE'

. END

Bibliographies (See Example 6)

Where it is desired to obtain a collection of documents covering an
extensive topic for time-consuming study, a broad search should be ini-
tiated, followed by entry of a PRINT command to produce complete copy on
the computer center high-speed line printer for courier delivery. For
instance, a user wishing to make a bibliographic study of "corrosion prod-

ucts" may enter on the terminal:
.LOOK <KE> = 'CORROSION'
. END

If the number of documents reported appears too large to handle, other

search commands may be entered.
Lh

From subsets of related references it will sometimes be desirable to

obtain combinations using the COMBINE command as follows:
.COMBINE 1 AND 2

will assemble a new subset of references common to both SUBSET #1 and
SUBSET #2

.COMBINE 1 OR 2

will assemble a new subset containing all references that appear in either

SUBSET #1 or SUBSET #2
.COMBINE 1 NOT 2

will assemble a new subset containing SUBSET #1 references but excluding
those that also appear in SUBSET #2.

Occasionally a user may wish to have a hard copy of results, but does
not want to wait for it to be typed at the terminal. Such copy may be ob-

tained by entering the command:
. PRINT

When the computer returns the word PRINTED and a period, terminal-control
has been restored to the user. The LIST (or PRINT) command with modifiers
can be used to obtain a structured bibliographic summary. Another type of
bibliographic search often useful is a search by authors, either modified

or unmodified by some topical parameter.

Definitive searches

Definitive searches to pinpoint some discrete piece of information
may take many forms. As users become experienced with the system opera-
tion and familiar with the file structure, they may be able to formulate
single search combinations that will hit their objectives, but that is
somewhat risky with respect to the possibility of missing relevant docu-
ments. Thus, it will usually prove desirable to first define the general
area of interest so as to set up an initial SUBSET of reasonable size on
which successive LOOK commands may operate. If first attempts do not hit

desired targets, returns can be made to that SUBSET for further operations
45

using different combinations of field delimiters, The various subsets

generated in Example 6 could, for example, be used in additional searches.

Auxiliary Operations
Summary tabulations (See Example 7)

It is useful either at the end of an ORLOOK session, or sometime
during the course of a rather extensive one, to have the computer formulate
on the terminal a tabulation of the successive search transactions. Such

an output can be obtained whenever desired by entering the command:
. REQUEST

The first column of the tabulation provides a ready reference of the
SUBSET # developed for the search items shown in the last column, as a
guide to further probing among designated collections of references. Ef-
ficiencies of successive sessions can be improved by study of request

summaries.

Search-field LABEL identification (See Example 8)

During the course of an ORLOOK session, if a user needs a reminder of
field identifier LABELS and their abbreviations, he may enter the command
LABELS. All LABELS recognized by the general ORLOCK program will be
listed; however, only a few of these are applicable to MSRIS &s shown in
Example 8.

The LOOK command when used without a field delimiter (as in Example 2)

causes the computer to search all fields of each entry for the object of
the command. (This is the "default" option built into the program.) This
rather time-consuming process can be avoided by designating a field as in
Example 3. However, field designation can also become time consuming (and
monotonous) if a user wishes to execute a large number of LOOK commands
within a given field type. To avoid this latter problem, the user may
change the default option to cause searching of any one field when an un-
modified LOOK is entered. To accomplish this the user enters the command:

«RESET
46

to which the computer response is:
KEY FIELD LABEL?

After the user enters the abbreviation of the LABEL selected, e.g., KE,

and the computer acknowledges
KEYWORDS SELECTED

that LABEL will be applied in all subsequent LOOK commands that are not

otherwise delimited. In this example, the command:
LOOK '.euuss!

will search only the KEYWORDS fields for the desired expression. A return
to the original mode, where all fields are searched when LABELS are un-
designated, may be accomplished by entering RESET again and responding to

the computer's question with ALL.

Terminal controls

The standard length of a line in ORLOOK transactions is limited to
80 characters for IBM compatible terminals and 70 characters for teletypes.

To alter the length, the following command may be entered:
. LINE TERMINAL, ===

substituting a two-or-three-digit figure for the dashes to designate the
number of characters desired. Similarly, prior to using the PRINT command,
maximum length of lines produced by the central computer line printer can

be altered by entering the command:
. LINE PRINTER, =---

Return to original line length limitations can be obtained by reentering
the commands and specifying 80 characters for IBM-compatible terminals and
70 characters for teletypes.

NOTE: Operations such as RESET and LINE TERMINAL appear to, and in

 

fact do, alter the basic ORLOOK program. However, these alterations do not
affect others who may be using the program at the same time; nor do they
remain in effect after the user concludes his session. Each user who

invokes the ORLOOK procedure is provided with a "fresh" copy of the
bT

original (and unalterable) program in a volatile region of the computer
memory. That copy, and any changes made in it by the user, remain aveil-
able only for the duration of that session (unless special storage is pre-
arranged and used). Thus, special features must be entered each time they

are used, but they need not be removed.
