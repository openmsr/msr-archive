CORROSION OF SEVERAL METALS IN SUPERCRITICAL STEAM AT 538°C

H. E. McCoy and B. McNabb

ABSTRACT

The corrosion of several iron- and nickel-base
alloys in supercritical steam at 24.1 MPa (3500 psi)
and 538°C has been measured to 7.92 x 107 sec (22,000 hr).
The experiments were carried out in TVA's Bull Run Steam
‘Plant. Corrosion was measured almost entirely by weight
change and visual appearance; a few samples were evaluated
by more descriptive analytical techniques. The corrosion
rates of low-alloy ferritic steels containing from 1.1 to
8.7% Cr and 0.5 to 1.0% Mo differed by less than a factor
of 2 in steam. Several modified compositions of
Hastelloy N were evaluated and found to corrode at about
equivalent rates. Of the alloys studied, the lowest
weight gain in 3.6 x 107 sec (10,000 hr) was 0.01 mg/cm?
for Inconel 718 and the highest 10 mg/cm? for the low-
alloy ferritic steels.

 

INTRODUCTION

This study was motivated by the need of the Molten-Salt Reactor
Program for a material for use in steam generators. Hastelloy N has
excellent compatibility with molten fluoride salts, but it failed
prematurely in a simulated superheated steam environment.’ Thus,
our program emphasized Hastelloy N, but included a total of over
80 alloys, mostly iron and nickel base. Because of our program to
modify the chemical composition of Hastelloy N to obtain better
resistance to embrittlement by irradiation and the fission product
tellurium, several alloys with compositions slightly different from
that of standard Hastelloy N were included in the study.

The tests were conducted in TVA's Bull Run Steam Plant in
supercritical steam at 24.1 MPa (3500 psi) and 538°C. One test period
included test times up to 5.4 X 107 sec (15,000 hr) and the data were
reported previously. ? A second test period covered an additional
2.52 x 107 sec (7000 hr) on many of the same test coupons and extended
the total exposure time to 7.92 X 107 sec (22,000 hr).. Since the
Molten Salt Reactor Program has again been discontinued, the results
of the total steam corrosion will be presented in this report.
Although the discussion will deal only with alloys selected to
illustrate several important characteristics of steam corrosion,
compositions and weight changes of all materials under investigation
will be listed.

 
 

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
Test Facility J

The facility used in this study is located in TVA's Bull Run
Steam Plant.?® This is a coal-fired plant with a supercritical steam
cycle and a power generation capability of 980 MW. The facility is
located about 5.49 m (18 ft) upstream from the turbine. The steam
is extremely clean at this location containing less than 1 ppb O02,
less than 5 ppb Cu, less than 3 ppb Na, less than 15 ppb SiOz, and
less than 6 ppb Fe. Hydrazine is added to the feed water to scavenge
oxygen, and the pH was controlled at 9.40 to 9.45 with ammonia. The
electrical conductivity of the steam condensate is usually less than
3x 1077 Qeem t.

Although the stream was generally very pure, during at least one
1.44 x 107 sec (4000 hr) period the level of impurities was significantly
higher. During this period all specimens gained very close to
0.5 mg/cm?. Bull Run engineers pointed out that several condenser
tube leaks had occurred in the previous year of operation, whereas
in earlier years, few if any condenser leaks occurred. Since the
cooling water in the condensers is at higher pressure than the
condensing steam, untreated cooling water is introduced into the
steam system hot well when a leak occurs. After replacement of
condenser tubes, most of the specimens lost weight for a brief period.
Perturbations in the weight change data due to this phenomenon will
be pointed out as the data are presented.

A schematic of the test facility is shown in Fig. 1 and a photo-
graph of the disassembled test assembly is shown in Fig. 2. The steam
entered the 4-in.-diam sched 160 type 316 stainless steel test chamber
at a flow rate of 0.12 to 0.13 kg/sec (16 to 17 1b/min). The initial
sample holder was a cube 50.8 mm (2 in.) on each side and would
accommodate 140 samples. A second sample holder was later added
that would hold 72 specimens. Most of the samples were 12.7 mm wide
X 50.8 mm long X 0.89 mm thick (1/2 in. wide X 2 in. long X 0.035 in.
thick). Alumina washers 0.51 mm (0.020 in.) thick were placed between
the specimens before they were bolted in place. Most of the space
between the holder and the vessel was baffled to force flow across
the samples at about 6.10 m/s (20 fps). Ten stressed instrumented
specimens were located at the front of the chamber and four uninstru-
mented stressed specimens were located in the filter basket. The
specimen geometry was chosen so that. the stress was provided by the
force of the steam on the inner wall. The wall thickness of the .
reduced section was varied from 0.25 to 0.75 mm (0.010 to 0.030 in.) *
to provide stresses of 531 to 193 MPa (77 to 28 x.10% psi). The
front ten specimens had small capillary tubes that were heated by
the steam when the tube specimen failed. A thermocouple attached to
each capillary was recorded by a multipoint recorder and indicated
when failure occurred. The steam passed through a metal filter to

Test Materials

Chemical analyses of the test materials are given in Table 1.
The first six alloys were commercial production materials. Alloys
LC, MC, and NC were small melts of 2 1/4 Cr-1 Mo steel with variations
in carbon content, and alloy 72768 is a commercial heat of 2 1/4 Cr-
1 Mo steel. The other alloys down to "Hastelloy N modifications"
were commercial production heats. Heats 185 through 237 were 2-1b
laboratory melts. Hastelloy N heats 21541 through 73008 were small
50- to 100-1b melts that were vacuum melted and fabricated by
commercial vendors. Hastelloy N heats 2477, 5065, 5067, 5085, 5095,
5101, and M1566 were large commercial heats of standard Hastelloy N.

All alloys were rolled to 0.89 m (0.035 in.) thick sheet. The
rolling was done cold with intermediate anneals for softening; the
finish of the exposed sample surface was generally typical of cold-
rolled sheet. Samples were sheared, cleaned in acetone and alcohol,
and annealed in argon for 1 hr at 927°C (the low-alloy ferritic steels),
1 hr at 1038°C (the stainless steels), or 1 hr at 1177°C (all other
alloys).

Evaluation

Generally only weight change measurements were made. However,
the samples were also examined visually for evidence of spalling,
oxide color, etc. More extensive evaluation was carried out on a
few specimens, including metallography to determine depth of oxide
penetration and electron microprobe scans of oxide-metal interfaces
to determine the compositions of the oxide and the metal beneath the
oxide.

The stressed specimens were removed every 1000 hr for examination.
Measurements were made of the inside diameter of each tube with a
die test gage. In this way several points were obtained on the
strain-time plot for each specimen. Any failed specimens were
replaced before the assembly was returned to Bull Run. Some of the
failed tubes were subjected to metallographic examination.

Errors

The specimens were weighed on a standard four-place balance with
an accuracy of *0.0001 g. The specimens had surface areas of 12 to
14 cm®, so the uncertainty in weight corresponded to almost 0.01 mg/cm?. . . oe
This error does not include small pieces of loose material that may
have been adhering to the specimen or small amounts of oxide that may
have been knocked off during disassembly. Efforts were made to minimize
these sources of error, but they are likely still present.

The stresses imposed on the tube burst specimens were affected by

" uncertainties in tube dimensions. The uncertainty in the wall thickness
was about *#0,0127 mm (+0.0005 in.). When the nominal wall thickness
was 0.254 mm (0.010 in.), this uncertainty introduced an error in the
stress of 5%. When the wall thickness was 0.762 mm (0.030 in.), this
uncertainty was about £27.

Experimental Observations

Weight gain results on all materials tested in steam are given in
the Appendix.

Low-Alloy Ferritic Steels

Five alloys containing from 1.1 to 8.7% Cr and 0.5 to 1.0% Mo
(Table 1) were exposed to steam for 14,000 hr at 538°C and these results
were presented previously? and are shown in Table Al. These specimens
were lost during the one year in which the program was inactive, and
it was necessary to begin testing with a new group of specimens. These
specimens were exposed 7000 hr, and the data for the second series are
shown in Fig. 3 along with the scatterband for the first series. The
extremes of the scatterband for the first series were defined by alloys
containing 1.1% Cr (lowest weight gain) and 1.9% Cr (highest weight
grain). These same alloys are near the extremes for the second series,
and the data from the two series generally agree very well.

The behavior in air was vastly different from that noted in
steam. After only 1000-hr exposure all alloys except the one containing
8.7% Cr_had begun to spall, and after 13,000-hr exposure all alloys
had lost weight?

Two samples from the steam series were examined metallographically
and typical photomicrographs are shown in Fig. 4. The microstructures
of the specimen containing 1.1 and 8.7% Cr were quite similar. The x
oxide, which consists of two distinct layers had a total thickness of
about 50 ym. The microstructure of the metal surface was altered to a
depth of about 10 um. Microprobe scans of these specimens showed that
the oxide layer nearest the metal contained detectable quantities of

24.1 MPa (3500 psi).

Fe, Cr, Mo, and Si with Fe and Cr being the predominant constituents.
Only iron was detected in the outermost oxide. The two alloys chosen
for metallographic examination had very similar weight gains and
gained the least weight of the series. Note in Table 1 that these
alloys were the highest in silicon and that silicon was detectable

in the oxide film. In light of these observations and previous work
that showed silicon to reduce the oxidation rate of steel,» it is
quite likely that the higher silicon content of these two alloys
resulted in their superior corrosion resistance.

The weight changes observed with several heats of 2 1/4 Cr-1 Mo
steel are shown in Fig. 5. The scatterbands from the observations
of steels containing from 1.1 to 8.7% Cr are shown and the data for
the four heats of 2 1/4 Cr-1 Mo steel fall within the scatterbands.
The low carbon heat had the lowest oxidation rate, but we do not
know a basis for attributing this to its low carbon content. These
same alloys were exposed in the 50% cold-worked condition. The data
from these specimens are presented in Fig. 6. A comparison of
Figs. 5 and 6 shows that cold working did not have a detectable
effect on corrosion. (These data are also tabulated in Table A2.)

Photomicrographs of three specimens of the 2 1/4 Cr-1 Mo steel
are shown in Fig. 7. The three specimens examined were (1) standard
alloy (heat 72768), annealed and air cooled, (2) standard alloy, “a
cold worked 50%, and (3) normal carbon (NC) alloy, annealed and air '
cooled. The oxides on all three specimens were very similar to each
other and to the alloys shown in Fig. 4. The oxide consisted of
two layers and had an overall thickness of about 50 um. The specimen
underneath the oxide was affected to a depth of 10 um or less. Electron
microprobe spectral analysis showed that the oxide on each specimen
nearest the metal contained detectable quantities of Fe, Cr, Mo, and
Si with Fe and Cr being the major constituent. The outermost oxide
layer contained only iron in detectable concentrations.

Hastelloy N

The weight changes of four heats of Hastelloy N exposed in steam
are shown in Fig. 8. The variation among the four heats is about the
same as the variation noted for duplication specimens of heat 5065,
One of the heats, 2477, was vacuum melted, and the other three were
air melted. The vacuum-melted heat was much lower in silicon and
manganese than the air-melted heats, but this had no detectable
effect on the corrosion rate in steam. After the first 4000-hr
exposure, the weight change can be described by an equation of the
form

AW = Kt°-2! | (1)

where AW is the weight gain in mg/cm?, t is the time in hr, and KX is
a constant. The perturbation in rate after 15,000 hr is thought to
be due to the condenser leaks in the plant and the attendant higher
impurity levels in the steam. After the leaks were repaired, the
rate of corrosion decreased.

Some Hastelloy N specimens from heat 5065 were given various
surface treatments before exposure to steam. Six samples were solution
annealed. Two of these were tested in the as-rolled and solution-
treated condition, two others were electropolished, and two were
abraded with 400 grit paper before exposure. Figure 9 shows that
the weight changes were least for the electropolished material, inter-
mediate for the as-rolled samples, and greatest for the abraded
samples. Although the corrosion process may have been affected in
a more complex way, the weight changes are qualitatively proportional
to the "true" surface area. .

One specimen was cold worked 50% and tested with an as-rolled
surface. The corrosion rate of this specimen was very near that of
the annealed specimen with an as-rolled surface. Thus, cold working
appears to have very little effect on the corrosion of Hastelloy N
in steam. This is in agreement with the results of a prior study in
which nickel-base alloys were noted to be less affected by cold working
than high chromium steels.’

Specimens from small commercial heats of modified Hastelloy N
containing from 0.10 to 2.1% Ti were exposed to steam, and the results
are summarized in Fig. 10. Alloys containing 0.1% Ti (21546) and
0.49% Ti (21545) gained weight more rapidly than the standard alloy.
However, the slope (weight change per unit time for greater than
2000 hr) was quite low for both these alloys and about equivalent to
that for the standard alloy at long times. Alloys containing 0.92,
1.30, and 2.1% Ti gained less weight than standard Hastelloy N during
10,000 hr exposure. However, extrapolations to longer times would
indicate that standard Hastelloy N and the alloys containing 0.10 and
0.50% Ti would gain less weight than the alloys containing more
titanium. One alloy containing 0.77 Nb was also exposed and gained
less weight than most of the titanium-modified alloys. The perturbation
after long exposure times was due to the increased impurity level in
the steam caused by the leaking condenser tubes. After the tubes were
repaired, the specimen lost weight.

Several laboratory melts of Hastelloy N containing additions of
Ti, Al, Zr, Hf, Y, Ce, and Nb were exposed to steam for 22,000 hr, and
the weight changes are shown in Fig. 11. Maximum and minimum weight
changes in these alloys differed by less than a factor of 2, but only
the alloy containing 1.03% Nb gained less weight than the standard alloy.
The perturbation after 15,000-hr exposure was due to leaking condenser
tubes, and the specimen lost weight after the tubes were repaired.

Typical photomicrographs of two heats of standard Hastelloy N are
shown in Fig. 12. The oxide was not of uniform thickness, but varied
from a few to about 20 um thick. Electronmicroprobe studies revealed
that both the inner and outer oxides contained Cr, Mo, Ni, and a trace
of Fe.

Four of the modified Hastelloy N specimens were examined metallo-
graphically and typical photomicrographs are shown in Fig. 13. The
oxides on all these alloys appear quite similar in morphology to
those formed on standard Hastelloy N. Electronmicroprobe scans of
these samples revealed iron and nickel in the oxide of alloy 69648
(0.92% Ti), Fe, Ni, Cr, Ti, and Mo in the oxide of alloy 21543 (0.7% Nb),
and nickel plus iron in the oxide of alloy 237 (1.03% Nb). The presence
of iron in most of the oxides may have been attributable to the presence
of iron particles in the steam. Since most of the steam circuit at
Bull Run is constructed of low-alloy ferritic steels, large amounts of
particulate iron are entrained in the steam and some deposit on the
test specimens.

Stainless Steels

The data on stainless steels are given in Table A3 and the data
for several selected steels are plotted in Fig. 14. These steels
contain from 5 to 25% Cr, and type 502 stainless steel with 5% Cr has
the highest oxidation rate. Type 17-7 PH steel contains 17% Cr plus
1.15% Al and has the lowest rate of weight change over the test period.
The other four steels have about equal weight changes, but types 406
and 446 seem to be approaching a very low rate of weight gain.

Several of these same alloys were exposed in the cold-worked
condition, and the observed weight changes of. several of these alloys
are shown in Fig. 15. Cold working reduced the corrosion rates of most
steels studied by about a factor of 2, but had an even larger effect
on type 201 stainless steel. This reduction of the corrosion rate of
high chromium steels has been observed by other investigators.” ® The
oxides on the annealed and cold-worked type 201 stainless steel specimens
were subjected to x-ray diffraction after 6000-hr exposure to steam in
an effort to determine a reason for the different oxidation behavior.
The oxide on the annealed specimen consisted of Fe30y and 0-~Fey03, and
the oxide on the cold-worked specimen was MnFe,0, and a-Fey03. The most
striking difference in the two specimens was that the matrix lines for
the annealed alloy were those of an fcc cell with a lattice parameter of
3.5975 £ 0.0006 A, and those for the cold-worked specimen were those of
a bec cell having a lattice parameter of 2.875 + 0.002 A plus a fcc cell
having approximately the same lattice parameter as above. The bcc lines
were not present in an as-cold-worked specimen, so the phase likely
formed during exposure to steam at 538°C. This bec phase is possibly
responsible in some undetermined way for the superior oxidation resistance
of the cold-worked materal. It is also possible that the formation of
MnFe204 on the cold-worked specimen may have increased its oxidation
resistance.

Six specimens of the stainless steel series were examined metallo-
grahically and typical photomicrographs are shown in Fig. 16. The 502
~ stainless steel with only 5% Cr had an oxide film about 80 um thick.
Electronmicroprobe studies of the oxide on this specimen showed that
the inner oxide contained iron and chromium and that only iron was
detected in the outermost oxide. The oxides on the types 304 and 316
stainless steel specimens were quite similar to each other in morphology
and were about 30 um thick. Electronmicroprobe.analysis showed that
these specimens all had outer oxides in which only iron could be
detected. The inner oxide of type 304 stainless steel contained iron,
chromium, and nickel, and the inner oxide of type 316 stainless steel
contained iron, nickel, chromium, and molybdenum. The photomicrographs
of type 201 stainless steel show the marked effect of cold working on the
rate of oxidation of this material. The oxide layer on the annealed
material was about 40 um thick and that on the cold-worked materials was
hardly detectable. On the annealed specimen the oxide consisted of
two distinct layers with the inner one containing Fe, Mn, Cr, and Ni
and the outer one containing iron and manganese. The oxide layer on
the cold-worked specimen was too thin to analyze by the electronmicroprobe
analytical technique used.

Other Alloys

Several other alloys were exposed to steam and their weight changes
are shown in Figs. 17 through 20. In Fig. 17 the behavior of Armco irom, .
Monel, Incoloy 800, and several nickel-base alloys is shown. Monel and ep
Armco iron gained weight at a very high rate whereas Inconel 718 gained
weight at a very slow rate. Inconel 600 fell at an intermediate level
of weight gain, and Inconel 601 fell at a lower level. Incoloy 800
gained weight at a relatively high rate for the first 2000 hr, but the
rate rapidly decreased to where the rate was proportional to time to
about the one tenth power.

The weight changes of several Hastelloys are shown in Fig. 18 and
the data cover about one-half log cycle. These alloys contain from
0.2% Cr (Hastelloy B) to 22% Cr (Hastelloy X), but the differences in
weight change are not simply inversely proportional to the chromium
content. : }

The weight changes of several alloys in the cold-worked condition are
shown in Fig. 19. By comparison with the annealed data in Figs. 17 and
18, some assessment can be made of the effects of cold working. Cold
working caused Hastelloy B to gain weight at a faster rate and slightly
reduced the weight gain of Incoloy 800. The weight gain of Inconel 718
appeared to be increased slightly by cold working, but the values are
still so low that inaccuracies in weighing make this conclusion rather
tenuous. The weight gained in the first 1000 hr was increased by cold
working for several of the Hastelloys, but the rate slowed to where
weight changes were about equivalent after a few thousand hours for
annealed and cold-worked material.

The weight changes of three alloys in the annealed and cold-worked
conditions are shown in Fig. 20. Haynes Alloy 188 gained weight more
rapidly in the cold-worked condition than in the annealed condition, but
the difference was quite small after 10,000-hr exposure. The weight
changes of all these alloys were quite low.

Three specimens from this series were examined metallographically
and typical photomicrographs are shown in Fig. 21. Incoloy 800 had a
very irregular oxide with the thickness in some areas as much as 10 um.
Examination by the electron microprobe showed that the inner oxide
contained iron, nickel, and chromium, and that the outer oxide contained
only iron in detectable quantities. This is in qualitative agreement
with the observations of Tilborg and Linde.!® Inconel 718 in the annealed
condition formed a subsurface reaction product to a depth of about 15 um
during exposure to steam, but this product was not present in the
material cold worked prior to exposure. The oxide was too thin to be
analyzed on the annealed specimen, but analysis of the oxide on the .
cold-worked specimen revealed the presence of iron, nickel, and chromium.

Tube Burst Results — Hastelloy N

Two heats of standard Hastelloy N tubing (N1 5095 and N2 5101) were
evaluated in the stressed condition from 193 to 531 MPa (28.0 to
77.0 x 10° psi). The specimens of both heats in the annealed condition
(1 hr at 1177°C) had shorter rupture times in steam than in argon.
Specimens of heat N1 5095 tested in the as-received condition and
stressed below 345 MPa (50.0 x 10° psi) in steam had rupture times
equal to those of specimens tested in argon. Figure 22 shows the
stress-rupture properties of heat Nl 5095. Flaws in the specimens may
have contributed to the scatter, but at stresses <345 MPa (<50.0 X 10° psi),
where wall thicknesses are heavier, there appears to be no significant
effect of steam on the rupture time. Two of the specimens stressed at
193 and 280 MPa (28.0 and 40.6 x .10° psi) accumulated 15,000-hr exposure.
to steam at 538°C without rupture and three others at slightly higher
stresses accumulated from 10,000 to 11,000 hr of exposure. Figure 23
shows the stress-rupture properties of heat N2 5101. Specimens in the.
annealed condition tested in steam had shorter rupture times than specimens
tested in argon. Specimens in the as-received condition tested in steam
had rupture times equal to or greater than specimens tested in argon.
The longest rupture time of this heat was 12,000 hr for a specimen
stressed at 336 MPa (48.8 x 10° psi) in steam at 538°C.

The minimum creep rates of both heats of material were plotted as a

function of stress in Fig. 24.

The creep rates were calculated from plots

of diametral strain, AD/D vs time, which were based on measurements of the

internal diameter of the specimens at 1000-hr intervals.

There is

considerable scatter in the data because of difficulty in measuring the
internal diameters at the point of maximum strain, but the figure is
useful as an indication of the strain rates expected in this stress

range.

Buildup of scale on the inside diameter exposed to steam also

constributes to the inaccuracy of this method since the apparent strain
is reduced as the scale thickens.

SUMMARY

The corrosion of several alloys in supercritical steam at 538°C
and 24.1 MPa (3500 psi) was measured for times up to 22,000 hr. Various
post-test examinations were performed, and the following important
abservations were made.

1. All the alloys formed tenacious, nonspalling oxides when tested
in steam.

2. The corrosion rates of five ferritic alloys containing from
1.1 to 8.7Z Cr and 0.5 to 1.0% Mo and four heats of 2 1/4 Cr-1 Mo steel
containing from 0.009 to 0.12% C were equal to within a factor of 2.

3. Cold working prior to exposure did not have a detectable effect
on the corrosion of 2 1/4 Cr-1 Mo steel.

4, The oxide layer formed on the ferritic steel was about 50 um thick
and consisted of two distinct layers. The layer next to the metal contained
detectable quantities of Fe, Cr, Mo, and Si, and the outermost oxide
contained only iron.

5. The corrosion rate of Hastelloy N in steam increased with
increasing surface roughness.

6. Although rather large changes were made in the composition of
Hastelloy N, the corrosion rate was altered by no more than a factor of
2 . !

7. The oxide on Hastelloy N was quite irregular with the thickness
in different locations varying from a few to 20 pum. The surface of the
oxide was quite high in iron, and this was likely due to the deposition
of particulate iron from the steam circuit.

8. The corrosion rates of several steels containing from 5 to 25% Cr
varied by an order of magnitude. The highest corrosion rate was exhibited
by type 502 with 5% Cr and the least by type 17 — 7 PH with 17% Cr and
1. 15% Al,

9. Cold working cause a large reduction in the corrosion rate of
type 201 stainless steel. This reduction was associated with either
the formation of a bcc phase or the spinel MnFe,0, that formed on the
cold-worked material. Cold working has a lesser effect on the other
high-chromium steels, but generally decreased the corrosion rates.

10. Oxides on the stainless steels generally consisted of 2 distinct
layers. The layer closest to the metal contained all principal constituents
of the alloy, and the outer oxide contained only iron in detectable
quantities.

 
 

28

11. Several iron- and nickel-base alloys were tested. Inconel 718
had the lowest weight gains, and gpeotey 800 had the lowest corrosion
rate with a dependence on (time)®

12. The inner oxide on Incoloy 800 contained irom, nickel, and
chromium, and the outer oxide contained only iron in detectable quantities.
The oxide on Inconel 718 contained iron, nickel, and chromium.

13. Inconel 718 in the annealed condition formed a subsurface
reaction product to a depth of about 15 um, but this product was not
present in the cold-worked material.

14. Although some small difference existed in the behavior of
annealed and cold-worked nickel-base alloys, the effects were reasonably
small.

15. The stress-rupture properties of Hastelloy N were lower in
steam than in argon at short rupture times, but were equivalent at
long rupture times.
