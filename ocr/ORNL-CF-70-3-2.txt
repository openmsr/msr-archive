COPY NO. 41

Information is given about the thermal stresses devel-

oped in the outlet nozzles of a reactor vessel for a 1000

Mw(e) Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor for several step changes in

the salt temperature. Calculation of the temperature distri-

butions, as well as of the stresses, was carried out by finite

element computer programs. Step temperature changes of 1300
to 1400°F, 1300 to 1600°F, 1300 to 1800°F, 1300 to 1200°F,
and 1300 to 1100°F were considered. For each step change the

number of cycles to fallure was estimated and an estimation

of whether or not gross cyclic yielding would occur was made.

1. INTRODUCTION

In a MSBR of 1000 Mw(e) the salt enters at a temperature of 1050°F
and will rise about 250°F as it passes the core. Under normal conditions
it is assumed that the salt temperature in and around the outlet nozzle
will be at 1300°F.

There are, however, circumstances in which the salt from the core
changes rapidly in temperature. Shortly after such a change, high tem-
perature gradients, and hence high thermal stresses, will occur near the
inner surface of the outlet nozzle and the connected pipe. Because the
heat dissipates through the structure, discontinuity stresses are also
produced at the intersection of the pipe and the nozzle since the nozzle
is relatively thick in comparison with the pipe.

Information about the structural damage produced by rapid changes in
salt temperature is needed for the design of a MSBR. Consequently, the
thermal stresses were computed after five different step changes in salt

temperature. The step changes were:

Downward Upward
1300 — 1200°F 1300 — 1400°F
1300 — 1100°F 1300 — 1600°F

1300 — 1800°F

It was assumed that these transients would not last longer than 10
seconds, since measures could be taken in that amount of time to bring
the salt temperature back to normal. The time at which the highest sur-
face and discontinuity stresses would occur was determined by a number
of stress computations at different time points for the step change
1300 — 1600°F. From the results of these computations at 1, 3, 5, 7, and
9 seconds, it was learned that the highest surface stresses in the pipe
occur at about 1 second, and in the nozzle wall they occur at about 9
seconds. The highest discontinuity stresses occur at about 9 seconds.
Since the temperature distributions were similar for all step changes,
and since the differences between the stresses produced at 1 and 3 seconds
and at 7 and 9 seconds were not large, computations were carried out only

at 1 and 9 seconds for the remaining step changes.

 
12

With the results obtained from the stress computations, estimates
were made of the number of cycles to failure for each condition. A
judgement was also made regarding the likelihood of gross cyclic yielding

at the intersection between the pipe and the nozzle.

2. DESCRIPTION OF CONFIGURATION AND
FINITE ELEMENT IDEALIZATION

2.1. Configuration

 

The outlet nozzles are attached to a cylindrical vessel about 22 ft
in diameter. The diameter of the outlet nozzles at the connection is
23 in. (Fig. 1). Most of the salt flows directly from the inlet through
the core to the outlet nozzles, but some salt from the inlet flows through
the gap between the cylindrical wall and the reflector (see Fig. 2).

Since the highest stresses expected are due to thermal loading, the
nozzles were considered to be attached to a flat plate rather than to a
cylindrical shell. With this simplification it was possible to consider
an axisymmetric problem for the thermal loading. Since the vessel
diameter to nozzle diameter ratio is about 12:1, the results were ex-
pected to be reasonably accurate.

The configuration, as shown in Fig. 3, was extended as far as possible
in order to approximate the real situation. The flat plate was taken suf-
ficiently large for the degree of restraint against thermal expansion to
closely approximate that of the cylindrical wall. The criterion for the
length of the connected pipe was that the discontinuity stresses should

be damped out to 10% at the end of the pipe.

2.2. Finite Element Mesh

The configuration shown in Fig. 3 was divided into a number of tri-
angular ring elements. A fine mesh was taken in regions where high
Stresses were expected. Although for the calculation of the temperature
distribution the mesh in some regions was finer than necessary, the same

mesh was used as for the stress analysis.

Plots and subplots of the mesh are given in Figs. 4 through 8.

3. TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION CALCULATIONS

The determination of the temperature distribution was carried out by

a finite element computer program. *

The program calculates the tempera-
ture of the nodal points situated at the vertices of the elements into
which the body has been divided. The temperature of the centroid of an
element is obtained by taking the average of the temperatures of the nodal
points. The difference of the centroid temperature and a reference tem-
perature 1s multiplied by the coefficient of thermal expansion, and the
resulting numbers are the input data for the SAFE-PCRS stress analysis
program. %’ 3 |

The following simplifications were made for these calculations:

1. The problem is axisymmetric.

2. Under normal conditions, the salt temperature is at 1300°F.

3. The temperature of the salt in the gap between the wall and the
reflector does not change.

4. Except along boundaries where the configuration is in contact
with the salt, 1t was assumed to be insulated.

5. The material properties are temperature independent.

- The material properties used are:

Conductivity coefficient: 12.7 Btu/hr-ft-F

Heat capacity: 75.8 Btu-ft3-F
The film coefficients are:

In the nozzle: 1600 Btu/hr-ft2-F

In the gap: 150 Btu/hr-ft°-F

The heat source strengths due to gamma radiation are:

Perpendicular to nozzle wall: 27.4 exp (—0.818x) Btu/hr-in.°>
Perpendicular to vessel wall: 30.2 exp (—0.818x) Btu/hr-in.~ ,

where x 1s the distance, in inches, from the wall. Although the intensity
of the gamma radiation changes during a transient, this effect was not
taken into account, since the time considered was relatively short.

The steady-state temperature distribution was first calculated be-

cause it was not uniform due to the internal heat generation.

 
14

4. STRESS ANALYSIS

4.1. General Remarks

The stress computations were carried out by a stress analysis finite
element computer program which determines the elastic stresses in an axi-
symmetric body. Where the value of the "stress" exceeds the yield strength,
the results from these computations must be interpreted as strain times
Young's modulus. Further discussion will be in terms of stress, since
the fatigue curves and Section III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel
Code are based on these elastically calculated stresses.

As already mentioned, in the first 10 seconds after the step change
in the salt temperature, high local surface stresses and high bending
stresses will occur. The surface stresses are high in the pipe and the
nozzle wall, while the bending stresses are dominant in the intersection
between the pipe and the nozzle. The stresses in these regions develop
as follows:

l. The Pipe. This rather thin and flexible part of the structure

 

changes rapidly in temperature. The highest surface stresses occur here
in the first seconds after the step change. These stresses quickly de-
crease because of the dissipation of heat.

2. The Nozzle Wall. This is a relatively thick and stiff part of

 

the structure and thus does not change as rapidly in temperature as does
the pipe. At 9 seconds after the step change, a region only 0.5 in. deep
is at a significantly different temperature from that in the steady-state
condition. The highest surface stresses occur at this time.

3. The Intersection. Due to the difference in thermal expansion be-

 

tween the pipe and the nozzle wall, high bending stresses occur here.
These stresses are classified as discontinuity stresses and can cause
cyclic yielding. The stresses produced by the pressure loading are also

of interest here.

4.2. Evaluation of Stresses

 

The stresses obtained by the finite element calculations were Cs

oO o oO o . and © in each element. T
7’ 99° 952 Opin? max hese stresses are assumed

»
15

to be constant within each element. Especially where steep thermal
gradients occur, the actual stresses vary significantly across an element
and the type of element (constant stress) which was used will not give
very accurate results unless a very fine mesh is employed. Higher order
elements or a finer mesh near the inside surface of the nozzle would im-
prove the results. For practical reasons these solutions were not applied.
According to Zienkiewicz (page 35, Ref. 4) the calculated stresses should
be assigned to the centroids of the elements.

For a section consisting of a row of elements, it is then possible to
plot the stress components at the centroids against the radius of these
centroids. The curve through these plotted points then gives a reasonable
approximation of the stress distribution through the wall in that section.

An approximation expression given by Manson’ enables us to check the
highest surface stress in the pipe and the nozzle wall. This expression,

which takes the Biot number into account, has the form

o, = BAZ] 1
s 1-=v 1.35 + 2:22 _

0.5 173]

and gives the maximum surface stress due to a step change in fluid tem-
perature on one side of a thin restrained flat plate. This case is essen-
tially the same as a thin, infinitely long, cylindrical shell. Generally,
there was good agreement when the stresses in the steady-state condition
at the surface were taken into account.

For the evaluation of the stresses it was necessary to use a strength
theory since a triaxial stress condition existed. Because of its accepted
use in Section IIT of the ASME Code, the maximum shear theory was used.
The stress intensity was thus determined by taking the largest algebraic
difference between any of the two principal stresses at a point. ©Since
the thickness of the pipe and the nozzle wall was small in comparison
with the diameter of the nozzle, G, was expected to be small. From the
results of the stress computations it was found that C, was small through-
out the wall. Since o. is equal to zero at the surface, it was set equal
to zero everywhere. With this simplification the stress intensity was

just the highest stress component in absolute value.

 
16

The high local surface stresses were considered to be peak stresses
which could damage the surface by fatigue cracking. For the evaluation
of these stresses the amplitude of the stress fluctuation must be deter-
mined. This amplitude was found by taking the algebraic difference be-
tween the highest occurring surface stress in the structure and the sur-
face stress in the steady-state condition for the same spot. The amplitude
of the stress fluctuation was then half the difference of the stresses.
The mean stress and hold-time effects were not taken into account because
they were of no significance for the cases considered. The number of
cycles to failure for each step change was determined from the fatigue
curves in Fig. 9.

The evaluation of the bending stresses in the intersection between
the pipe and the nozzle was more complicated. In addition to the thermal
loading, the pressure loading should be taken into account. The internal
pressure in the nozzle was, however, low (14 psig), and hence the effect
of this loading was not expected to be significant. In order to deter-
mine the order of magnitude of the stresses produced by the pressure load-
ing, a simplified calculation was carried out. For this calculation it
was assumed that the pressure in the pipe was 30 psig and that the radial
stress at the edge of the plate was equal to the circumferential stress
in the vessel wall for the same internal pressure. A higher pressure
than 14 psig was taken since no end plate (causing an axial membrane
stress in the nozzle) was added to the configuration. The end plate was
neglected since the relatively thin flat plate behaves differently from
a cylindrical shell. It was found, from this calculation, that the stress
intensity in nearly the entire intersection was lower than 1 ksi. The
error in the determination of the thermal stresses was several times larger
than this, and hence the stresses produced by the pressure loading were
neglected.

In order to estimate whether or not serious cyclic yielding would
occur in the intersection, it was determined over what percentage of the
section a higher stress intensity than S occurs, where Sy is the yleld

strength and is given in Fig. 10 as a function of temperature.

5. RESULTS OF STRESS COMPUTATIONS

In this chapter the results of the stress computations for different
conditions are presented. From these results estimates of the number of
cycles to failure have been made, and also it has been determined, for
each condition, whether or not gross cyclic yielding might occur.

The temperature distributions presented have been obtained by plotting
the nodal point values against the distance from the centerline. The
procedure by which the stress distributions were obtained was described
in Chapter 4. The stress component presented for each section is the
highest component occurring there, and since C. has been set equal to

zero this stress component is also the stress intensity.

5.1. Steady-State Condition

 

The temperature distributions through the wall at sections A-A, B-B,
C-C, D-D, E-E, and F-TF are presented in Figs. 11 through 16, respectively.
The stress distributions through the wall in the first five sections are
shown in Figs. 17 through 21.

These stress distributions are necessary to determine the amplitude

of the stress fluctuation for the other conditions.

5.2. Step Change 1300 — 1400°F

 

The temperature distributions through the wall at sections A-A, B-B,
C-C, D-D, and E-E are presented in Figs. 22 through 26, respectively.
The stress distributions in the same sections are shown in Figs. 27
through 31.

The surface stress that gives the highest amplitude of stress fluctu-

ation occurs in section D-D, and at this spot we have:

The circumferential stress: 21 ksi
The surface temperature: 1380°F
The circumferential stress in the 7 ksi

steady-state condition:
The amplitude of the stress fluctuation: 14 ksi

From the fatigue curves in Fig. 9 we find that fatigue cracking is unlikely

for this condition.

 
18

For section B-B, where the highest discontinuity stresses occur, we
have at 9 seconds after the step change:

The average temperature: 1350°F
The yield strength at 1350°F: 20 ksi

From the stress distribution in Fig. 28 we find that no yielding will

occur.

5.3. Step Change 1300 — 1600°F

 

The temperature distributions through the wall in sections A-A, B-B,
C-C, D-D, and E-E are presented in Figs. 32 through 36, respectively.
The stress distributions in the same sections are shown in Figs. 37 through
41. |

The surface stress that gives the highest amplitude of the stress

fluctuation occurs in section D-D, and at this spot we have:

The circumferential stress: 70 ksi
The surface temperature: 1540°F
The circumferential stress in the 7 ksi

steady-state condition: :
The amplitude of the stress fluctuation: 38.5 ksi

From the fatigue curves in Fig. 9 we find that the number of cycles to
failure might be as low as 90.

For section B-B, where the highest discontinuity stresses occur, we
have, at 9 seconds after the step change:

The average temperature: 1450 °F
The yield strength at 1450°F: 20 ksi

From the stress distribution in Fig. 38 we find that the stress intensity
is higher than 5, in about 30% of this section. It can thus be suspected

that gross cyclic yielding might occur in this section.

5.4. Step Change 1300 — 1800°F

 

The temperature distributions through the wall in sections A-A, B-B,
C-C, D-D, and E-E are presented in Figs. 42 through 46, respectively.
The stress distributions in the same sections are shown in Figs. 47 through
51.

The surface stress that gives the highest amplitude of the stress

fluctuation occurs in section D-D, and at this spot we have:
19

The circumferential stress: -118 ksi
The surface temperature. 1700°F
The circumferential stress in the "7 ksi

~ steady-state condition: | |
The amplitude of the stress fluctuation: 62.5 ksi

There are presently no fatigue data available for 1700°F, but since
S_1¢ 18 very high it is estimated that cracking might occur after only one
or two cycles.

For section B-B, where the highest discontinuity stresses occur, we
have, at 9 seconds after the step change:

The average temperature: 1550°F
The yield strength at 1550°F: 20 ksi

From the stress distribution in Fig. 48 we find that the stress intensity
is higher than <5, in about 55% of this section. It can be concluded that

gross cyclic yielding will occur for this condition.

5.5. Step Change 1300 — 1200°F

 

The temperature distributions through the wall in sections A-A, B-B,
C-C, D-D, and E-E are presented in Figs. 52 through 56, respectively. |
The stress distributions in the same sections are shown in Figs. 57 through
61.

The surface stress that gives the highest amplitude of the stress

fluctuation occurs in section D-D, and at this spot we have:

The circumferential stress: 34 ksi
The surface temperature: 1225°F
The circumferential stress in the 7 ksi

steady-state condition:
The amplitude of the stress fluctuation: 13.5 ksi

From the fatigue curves in Fig. 9 we find that fatigue cracking is unlikely
for this condition.

For section B-B, where the highest discontinuity stresses occur, we
have, at 9 seconds after the step change:

The average temperature: 1250°F
The yield strength at 1250°F: 20 ksi

From the stress distribution in Fig. 58 we find that no yielding will occur

at the intersection.

 
20

5.6. Step Change 1300 — 1100°F

The temperature distribution through the wall in sections A-A, B-B,
C-C, D-D, and E-E are presented in Figs. 62 through 66, respectively.
The stress distributions in the same sections are shown in Figs. 67 through
71.

The surface stress that gives the highest amplitude of the stress

fluctuation occurs in section D-D, and at this spot we have:

The circumferential stress: | 58 ksi
The surface temperature: 1145°F
The circumferential stress in the 7 ksi

steady-state condition:
The amplitude of the stress fluctuation: 25.5 ksi

From the fatigue curves in Fig. 9 we find that the number of cycles to
failure might be as low as 2 X 10°.

For section B-B, where the highest discontinuity stresses occur, we
have, at 9 seconds after the step change:

The average temperature: 1220°F
The yield strength at 1220°F: 20 ksi

From the stress distribution in Fig. 68 we find that the stress intensity
is higher than S in about 10% of this section. It can be concluded that

no gross cyclic yielding will occur for this condition.

6. CONCLUSIONS

From the results of the stress calculations it was found that:

1. A step change of 100°F in the salt temperature upward or downward
will not cause any damage to the configuration.

2. The step change 1300 — 1100°F might possibly cause fatigue crack-
ing after a large number of cycles, but no gross cyclic yielding would
occur.

3. A step change from 1300 — 1600°F would cause fatigue cracking
after about 90 cycles and gross cyclic yielding might occur in the inter-
section between the pipe and the nozzle.

4. The step change 1300 — 1800°F is likely to cause cracks after
a very few cycles and gross cyclic yielding will occur in the intersection

between the nozzle and the pipe.
