SUBJECT: Comparison of Calculations and Uncertainties in the
Temperature Coefficients of Reactivity in the MSRE

TO: Distribution

FROM: B. E. Prince

ABSTRACT

Several calculated values for the MSRE temperature
coefficients of reactivity have been reported in dif-
ferent sources. These values are compared and their
bases discussed in this memorandum. Calculations based
on new experimental data for the temperature coefficient
of expansion of the fuel salt are also included. Ranges
of uncertainty in the current "best values" of tempera-
ture coefficients of reactivity and critical concentra-
tion are suggested, and the implication of these un-
certainties in the zero power critical experiments are
discussed. It is concluded that, with presently planned
procedures, the expected uncertainties will not reduce
reactor safety below that previously reported in the
MSRE safety report.

INTRODUCTION

In the course of obtaining estimates of basic nuclear design para-
meters for the MSRE, several values have been reported for the critical
concentration and temperature coefficients of reactivity. One should
first note that these calculations have had an evolutionary aspect, that
is, the more recent calculations are generally considered to be "better",
either in terms of the physical model or the basic nuclear data used in
calculating the reported characteristic. In the case of the critical
concentration, the most recent computations have been reported in Ref. 1 along
with a discussion of the origin of differences from previous calculations.
In this memorandum we shall try to achieve some clarification of the second

case, that of the temperature coefficients of reactivity.

DISCUSSION

The earliest reported calculations of the temperature coefficients
for the final MSRE core design were those of Nestor.= As indicated in
Table 1, two-group bare reactor theory was used, together with the specific
assumptions:

1. The neutron temperature and the graphite temperature are identical.

~ 2. The effects of changes in reactor size are negligible.

3. The Fermi age is a function only of the graphite density.

4k. The resonance escape probability, fast effect, and n for yo
were independent of temperature.
The fuel salt analyzed by Nestor contained ~0.5 mol % UF) , 93% enriched in
7 in a carrier salt composition of T70/24/5/1 mol % LiF/BeF,/ZrF, /ThF, .
This salt is designated as Fuel A. Subsequent to Nestor's work, it was
decided not to include thorium in the first MSRE fuel salt mixture, and
to use instead a salt composed of ~0.2 mol % UF) , 93% enriched in Ue, in
a carrier salt of 67/29/4 mol % LiF/BeF,/ZrF) . This salt is designated as
Fuel B. New calculations of the temperature coefficients were required,
and this time use was made of two-group perturbation theory to check the
validity of the one-region approximation.” The remaining assumptions used

in the earlier calculations were retained. These results are given in

line 2 of Table 1. Together with the perturbation theory calculations,
estimates based on a one-region homogeneous model were also made for fuel
B. The resulting coefficients were found to compare within 5 to 10%,
indicating that the detailed description of the external regions of the
core (downcomer, top and bottom heads, etc.) did not significantly in-
fluence the reactivity coefficients. Note, however, that the magnitude
of the temperature coefficients differs from the earlier calculations
primarily because of the change in fuel salt composition. With fuel B
the reactor neutron spectrum is more thermalized and the effect of salt
density changes on the leakage factors is proportionally larger.

A further request was made to examine the possibility of increasing
the total uranium content of the salt to the range of 0.8-0.9 mol % UF),
(~35% enriched for criticality, designated fuel C). About this same time,
two new computer programs were acquired by use of which detailed calcula-
tions of the slowing down and thermal spectra could be made. Specifically,
the GAM-1 program’ 1s based on consistent P-1 theory for calculation of
the slowing down spectrum in finite, homogeneous mixtures. The THERMOS
program’ numerically solves the Boltzmann equation for the thermal spectrum
in a one-dimensional lattice cell, and thus allows the temperature of the
fuel salt and graphite to be independently varied. A minor complication
in the GAM-1 calculation for the MSRE spectrum was that the then-available

version of the cross section library did not include Li , Li

however, to warrant simulating the slowing down effect of the lithium and
fluorine by an equivalent amount of oxygen, which was included in the GAM-1
cross section library. With these programs available, it was decided to
recalculate the temperature reactivity coefficients for all three fuels
under consideration, and to further examine the validity of some of the
assumptions underlying previous calculations. The results are summarized
in lines 3, 4, and 5 of Table 1. The major difference in these results

and previously reported values is in the graphite temperature coefficient.
This difference arises primarily in the temperature dependence of the
thermal spectrum. For the MSRE lattice, (a) the thermal spectrum is not

determined by the graphite temperature (assumption 1, above ) but depends

 
on the temperature of the fuel channel as well, and (b) the Maxwell-
Boltzmann approximation predicts too large a change in the thermal dif-
fusion length as the temperature is varied.

Other differences are also reflected in the values given in lines 3,
4, and 5 of Table 1. These include the modified estimate of the graphite
expansion coefficient, based on an average of longitudinal and transverse
expansions, and changes due to explicit treatment of the temperature de-
pendence of resonance absorption (assumption h, above). In general, these
differences were smaller than that due to the spectrum effect discussed
above.

Very recently, new experimental data has become available for the
density and temperature coefficient of expansion of fuel salt c.! These
new data indicate that the expansion coefficient is nearly 60% larger in
magnitude than assumed in the preceding calculations. The previous values
had been based on estimated temperature variations in the molar volumes of
the salt constituents.o

Also subsequent to the last reported calculations, acquisition was
made of the GAM-2 program, an improved version of GAM-1l, described above.
By means of this new program, the slowing down effects in lithium and
fluorine could be treated explicitly. The program has already been used
to revise estimates of critical concentration and control rod worth,” and
a set of temperature coefficients of reactivity for fuel C was also re-
calculated based on the new density data and the GAM-2 program. These
results are summarized in line 6 of Table 1. As may be expected, the new
expansion coefficient causes a significant increase in the fuel tempera-
ture coefficient of reactivity. Also, the explicit treatment of the
slowing down by lithium and fluorine, particularly the inelastic scat-
tering of fluorine, has the effect of further thermalizing the reactor
spectrum. Hence both fuel and graphite reactivity coefficients are in-
creased.

Most of the changes summarized in Table 1 have had the effect of
making the fuel, or prompt temperature coefficient of reactivity more
negative. In turn, the changes appear to improve the safety and stability
margins for reactor operation. The question still remains, however,

as to the absolute uncertainties in these parameters. A method is
presently being investigated by which the uncertainty in the basic library
of nuclear cross section data and densities can be related to the un-
certainties in the nuclear design parameters (critical concentration, etc.).
The basic notion is that of relating the standard deviation in the cal-
culated parameter to the standard deviations in the cross sections and
densities. This method would indicate the sensitivity in the parameters

To uncertainties in all basic data used in calculation, and would be use-
ful in later evaluation of results from the reactor critical experiments.
This 1s not complete at the date of this writing and could not be included.
However, since the validity of most of the main assumptions in the computa-
tion have been checked, it appears reasonable to assign a confidence in-
terval of +10% to the critical concentration and +25% to the temperature
coefficients of reactivity. Because of the "slope-like" nature of the
latter quantity, it is expected to be the more sensitive of the two to
errors in data and computational methods.

For all of the conceivable incidents previously analyzed which could
result in significant additions of reactivity, only the so-called cold
slug accident would lead to a more severe transient if the fuel temperature
coefficient of reactivity were more negative. This incident is not ex-
pected to lead to dangerous or damaging conditions, and in addition,
precaution will be taken not to start fuel circulation unless the control
rods are inserted in the core. Thus, safe operation should be insured
for all values of the fuel reactivity coefficients indicated in Table 1.

The procedures of the initial critical experiments will be designed’.
to allow greater uncertainty in the clean critical concentration than the
10% margin suggested above. The initial addition of uranium to the salt
in the drain tanks will be ~65% of that predicted for criticality at zero
power with all rods withdrawn from the core. The second addition is
anticipated to be that amount to bring the salt within 87% of the critical
mass. From this point on, the amount in each addition will be determined
by inverse count rate measurements. Even if the minimum critical mass
were exceeded, this would only mean that criticality would be achieved
with the rods slightly inserted and would not require other special

procedures.
{(y

The uncertainty in the temperature coefficients of reactivity has no
effect on procedures in the zero power critical experiments. The coef-
ficients will be measured along with the rod calibration experiments, and
any large discrepancy between measured and calculated coefficients will
be taken into consideration in the planning and operation of experiments

at higher power levels.
