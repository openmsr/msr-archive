Introduction

The objective of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program is
the development of nuclear reactors which use fluid
fuels that are solutions of fissile and fertile materials in
suitable carrier salts. The program is an outgrowth of
the effort begun over 20 years ago in the Aircraft
Nuclear Propulsion program to make a molten-salt
reactor power plant for aircraft. A molten-salt reactor —
the Aircraft Reactor Experiment — was operated at
ORNL in 1954 as part of the ANP program.

Our major goal now is to achieve a thermal breeder
reactor that will produce power at low cost while
simultaneously conserving and extending the nation’s
fuel resources. Fuel for this type of reactor would be
233UF, dissolved in a salt that is a mixture of LiF and
BeF,, but it could be started up with 2*°U or
plutonium. The fertile material would be ThF, dis-
solved in the same salt or in a separate blanket salt of
similar composition. The technology being developed
for the breeder is also applicable to high-performance
converter reactors.

A major program activity until recently was the
operation of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment. This
reactor was built to test the types of fuels and materials
that would be used in thermal breeder and converter
reactors and to provide experience with the operation
and maintenance of a molten-salt reactor. The MSRE
operated at 1200°F and produced 7.3 MW of heat. The
initial fuel contained 0.9 mole % UF,4, 5% ZrF,, 29%
BeF,, and 65% "LiF, a mixture which has a melting
point of 840°F. The uranium was about 33% 235 U.

The fuel circulated through a reactor vessel and an
external pump and heat exchange system. All this
equipment was constructed of Hastelloy N, a nickel-
molybdenum-iron-chromium alloy with exceptional re-
sistance to corrosion by molten fluorides and with high
strength at high temperature. The reactor core con-
tained an assembly of graphite moderator bars that
were in direct contact with the fuel.

Heat produced in the reactor was transferred to a
coolant salt in the primary heat exchanger, and the
coolant salt was pumped through a radiator to dissipate
the heat to the atmosphere.

Design of the MSRE started in the summer of 1960,
and fabrication of equipment began early in 1962. The
reactor was taken critical on June 1, 1965. Operation at
low power begin in January 1966, full power was
reached in May, and sustained power operation was
begun in December. In September 1967, a run was
begun which continued for six months, until terminated
on schedule in March 1968.

Completion of this six-month run brought to a close
the first phase of MSRE operation, in which the
objective was to demonstrate on a small scale the
attractive features and technical feasibility of these
systems for civilian power reactors. We believe this
objective has been achieved and that the MSRE has
shown that molten-fluoride reactors can be operated at
temperatures above 1200°F without corrosive attack on
either the metal or graphite parts of the system, that
the fuel is completely stable, that reactor equipment
can operate satisfactorily at these conditions, that
xenon can be removed rapidly from molten salts, and
that, when necessary, the radioactive equipment can be
repaired or replaced.

The second phase of MSRE operation began in
August 1968, when a small facility in the MSRE
building was used to remove the original uranium
charge from the fuel salt by treatment with gaseous F,.
In six days of fluorination, 221 kg of uranium was
removed from the molten salt and loaded onto ab-
sorbers filled with sodium fluoride pellets. The decon-
tamination and recovery of the uranium were very
good.

After the fuel was processed, a charge of 23*U was
added to the orginal carrier salt, and in October 1968
the MSRE became the world’s first reactor to operate
on 233U. The nuclear characteristics of the MSRE with
the 233U were close .to the predictions, and, as
expected, the reactor was quite stable.

In September 1969, small amounts of PuF; were
added to the fuel to obtain some experience with
plutonium in a molten-salt reactor. The MSRE was shut
down permanently. December 12, 1969, so that the
funds supporting its operation could be used elsewhere
 

 

 

 

in the research and development program. An in-
spection of parts of the reactor is under way, and
samples of materials are being removed for examina-
tion.

Most of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program is now
being devoted to the technology needed for future
molten-salt reactors. Conceptual design studies are
being made of breeder reactors, and the program
includes work on materials, on the chemistry of fuel
and coolant salts, on processing methods, and on the
development of components and systems.

Because of limitations on the chemical processing
methods available at the time, until three years ago
most of our work on breeder reactors was aimed at
two-fluid systems in which graphite tubes would be

used to separate uranium-bearing fuel salts from tho-

rium-bearing fertile salts. In late 1967, however, a.

one-fluid breeder became feasible because of the de-
velopment of a process that uses liquid bismuth to
isolate protactinium and remove rare earths from a salt
that also contains thorium. Our studies showed that a
one-fluid breeder based on the new process can have
fuel utilization characteristics approaching those of our
two-fluid designs. Since the graphite serves only as
moderator, the one-fluid reactor is more nearly a
scaleup of the MSRE. These advantages caused us to
change the emphasis of our program from the two-fluid
to the one-fluid breeder; most of our design and
development effort is now directed to the one-fluid
system.

Summary

PART 1. MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR EXPERIMENT

1. MSRE Operations

The MSRE remained shut down, with the salt frozen
in the tanks and the primary systems intact, awaiting
the scheduled examinations. Procedures were readied,
and tools were designed and procured. Equipment to
become surplus was identified. Specimens of radiator
tubes and thermocouple wells in the coolant salt line
were cut out for examination.

Continuing analysis included the gamma spectrometry
data and other evidence of noble-metal fission product
behavior. Comparison of observed deposition with a
model based on conventional mass transfer theory
showed reasonable agreement, suggesting that the noble
metals quickly migrate, as extremely small particles, to
solid or gas interfaces.

Examination of data from previous experiments
indicates that fluorine evolution from the frozen fuel
can be easily controlled.

2. Component Development

Component development for the MSRE was con-
cluded with the termination of endurance tests of the
Mark 2 fuel pump (at 16,680 hr of salt circulation) and
a lubricating oil pump (at 58,900 hr).

PART 2. MSBR DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
3. Design

A comprehensive report on the conceptual design
study of a 1000-MW(e) molten-salt bréeder reactor
power station is near completion, and copies of the
final draft have been circulated at ORNL for comment
and review. -

Since the first molten-salt power reactor could be a
demonstration unit in the 100-to-300-MW(e) size range,
a conceptual design study has been initiated to investi-

xi

gate the features of such a plant of 300-MW(e) size. The
plant being studied is a converter that uses periodic
discard to rid the fuel salt of fission product poisons
rather than awaiting development of continuous chem-
ical processing systems needed for breeders.

The basic arrangement of the demonstration unit is
much the same as that of the 1000-MW(e) MSBR. It is
of the single-fluid type, with 7 LiF-BeF, -ThF 4-UF, fuel
salt that flows upward through an unclad graphite-
moderated and -reflected core. The heat is transferred
in primary heat exchangers to a circulated sodium
fluoroborate coolant salt, which transports the energy
to supercritical-pressure steam generators and to steam
reheaters. The steam turbine power cycle has a 1000°F
throttle temperature, reheat to 1000°F, a regenerative
feedwater heating system, and special provisions to
attain high-temperature feedwater. The overall plant
thermal efficiency is about 44%.

The Hastelloy N reactor vessel is about 26 ft in
diameter X 32 ft high with a wall thickness of about 2
in. The reactor core design is very similar to that used
successfully in the MSRE, consisting of 4 X 4 in.
vertical graphite elements. Flow passages are sized to
provide the desired salt-to-graphite ratios in the various
regions of the core and an essentially uniform salt
temperature rise through all regions. The salt enters at
about 1050°F and leaves at 1300°F. The reactor has a
conversion ratio above 0.8. The relatively low power
density of about 10 W/cm? permits the graphite to last
the lifetime of the plant and eliminates the need for a
removable head on the reactor vessel. ~- 7.

The primary heat exchangers are of the U-shell type
with %-in.-OD U-tubes. The maintenance arrangement
is to cut the heads from the shell, operating from the
side . through plugged openings in the cell wall, to
expose the tube sheets for location and plugging of
faulty tubes.

During normal operation the fuel salt circulating
pumps overflow to a drain tank, and fission product
gases extracted from the salt circulating system pass
 

 

 

through the drain tank for holdup and decay. The drain
tank is cooled by a natural circulation NaK system
which rejects heat to an elevated pool of water. Double
barriers, with radiant heat transfer across gas-filled
annuli, are used in both the drain tank and the water
pool to assure isolation of the NaK from the fuel salt
and the water.

A fuel salt storage tank is provided for the fuel salt in
event repairs are needed on the primary drain tank. This
storage tank can also be used for the fluorination
process to recover the uranium from a spent fuel salt
charge and for addition of UF¢ and H, to new carrier
salt for reconstituting a fresh charge. Storage facilities
for spent carrier salt are provided in the reactor
building. It is estimated that the salt charge would have
to be replaced about three times during the 30-year
lifetime of the plant.

Temperatures produced by the heat from decay of
deposited fission products were calculated for primary
heat exchangers of sizes from 94 to 281 MW, and the
results were extrapolated to the 563-MW size of the
reference design. The calculations assumed that the
exchangers were drained of primary and secondary-salts
and that the heat was radiated to surroundings at
1000°F. The maximum temperatures were found to be
in the range of 1700 to 2100°F for a 141-MW
MSBE-size exchanger, but extrapolated results indicated
that the temperatures in a 563-MW MSBE exchanger
would be unacceptably high,

Preparations were nearly completed for issuance of a
request for proposals for an industrial study of a
1000-MW(e) MSBR.

4. Reactor Physics

We have continued our investigation of MSR core
configurations having sufficiently low power density
that the graphite moderator should not require replace-
ment over the life of the plant (i.e., 30 years) and have
considered a power level of 300 MW(e) as well as 1000
MW(e). Fuel-cycle analyses have been performed for
such cores over a range of thorium concentrations from
10 to 18 mole %. With continuous processing, as for the
reference single-fluid MSBR, we find breeding ratios
comparable with that of the reference breeder (1.06)
but somewhat higher specific fuel inventories, associ-
ated with the lower power density. Consequently, the
fuel yields and conservation coefficients are lower than
for the reference breeder. Fuel-cycle cost is about 0.7
mill/kWhr(e) for the 1000-MW(e) reactor and about 1.1
to 1.2 mills/kWhr(e) for the 300-MW(e) reactor. Opti-
mum thorium concentrations, when optimized in terms

xii

of the fuel conservation coefficient, are a little higher
than for the reference breeder, that is, 15 to 17 mole %,
as compared with 12%.

Calculations have been performed for a series of batch
fuel cycles, in which the fuel salt, including thorium
and plutonium, is assumed to be discarded after several
years of operation, with only the uranium carried over
to the subsequent cycle. These reactors, of course, have
conversion ratios substantially below unity. For ex-
ample, a 300-MW(e) reactor with 30-year graphite life,

plutonium feed, and an 8-year batch procéssing cycle |

would have a lifetime-average conversion ratio of about

0.84 and a fuel-cycle cost of 0.8 to 0.9 mill/kWhr(e).

The same reactor could become a breeder by addition
of appropriate chemical processing equipment.

The measurement of the capture-to-fission cross-
section ratio, a, for 233U in the MSRE circulating fuel
salt has been successfully completed. The measured
value is 0.1233 + 0.0039. The corresponding calculated
value using the cross sections and computational meth-
ods used in predicting MSBR performance is 0.1226.
The uncertainty of +3.2% in the measured value, if
applicable to the calculated value for the MSBR,
corresponds to an uncertainty in breeding ratio of
approximately +0.008.

5. Systems and Components Development

The gas removal efficiency of the centrifugal gas
separator while operating with circulating water con-
taining various concentrations of entrained air bubbles
was found to be affected most by an instability of the
vortex in front of the recovery hub. Since the initial
separation of the gas bubbles to the central vortex
appears to be virtually 100%, the gas takeoff port is
being redesigned in an attempt to improve the vortex
stability. The bubble generator designs previously tested
have shown a tendency for the liquid flow to oscillate
along the trailing edge of the generator and for the gas
flow to distribute itself unevenly among the gas feed
holes. Testing has shown a design resembling a jet pump
to have some promise, and testing is continuing. A
water test loop which will permit testing full-sized
MSBE bubble generators and gas separators has been
designed and is being fabricated.

The program for obtaining design studies of molten-
salt-heated steam generators from industrial firms has
been rewritten and now consists of four tasks: The first
two will result in conceptual designs of steam genera-
tors for the ORNL 1000-MW(e) reference design and
for an alternate steam cycle to be suggested by the
industrial firm. The third task will show how the

yd

oh
 

uy

«@ hy

designer would propose to scale one of the two
conceptual designs for use with a molten-salt reactor of
about 150 MW(t). The fourth task will describe a
research and development program necessary to assure
the adequacy of the design of the Task III steam
generator. Further work on the facility for testing
steam generator tubes and tube arrangements of up to 3
MW(t) capacity has been suspended. Instead, we are
proceeding to prepare a conceptual design of a loop
with a capacity in the range of 50 to 150 kW which will
be used to study steady-state operation of sections of
molten-salt-heated steam generators. We are preparing a
report which will describe the status of the molten-salt
steam generator technology, show which elements of
the LMFBR program will be of use in the molten-salt
technology program, and define the areas which need
further experimental study.

A test was run in the sodium fluoroborate circulation
loop to determine if a small quantity of water injected
into the salt in the pump bowl could be detected by
monitoring the off-gas stream for a change in con-
taminant level. An on-line water detector failed to show
a positive response when the water was injected. A
temporary increase in collection rate was noted on two
cold traps, but less than 50% of the injected water was
accounted for by the total weight of material collected.
The data did not yield any clear-cut evidence as to the
fate of the missing water. The water injection test
concluded the current phase of the fluoroborate circula-
tion program in the PKP loop, and the loop was shut
down and drained on April 13, 1970. Since the initial
operation in March 1968, 11,567 hr of circulating have
been accumulated; of this total, 10,632 hr were with
the clean batch of salt.

All activities in the MSBE salt pump procurement
program and the salt pump test stand (SPTS) were
suspended indefinitely in light of the AEC decision to
redirect the MSRP along the lines of a technology
program. The fabrication and assembly of the water test
model of the ALPHA pump were completed.

In the remote welding program, emphasis has been
placed on developing an automatic welder which will
produce consistently good welds without direct obser-
vations or manual adjustments. Such a system will be of
value for use in the initial construction of reactors and
will also be suitable for further development to achieve
completely remote operation for maintenance appli-
cations in high-radiation zones. The program has
reached the point at which the usefulness in reactor

6. MSBR Instrumentation and Controls

Further studies were conducted of the part-load
steady-state behavior of the reference MSBR plant.
Cases studied involving both constant and variable
secondary salt flow rate with load produced un-
acceptably low temperatures at the reactor inlet and/or
in the secondary salt cold leg. The addition of a variable
bypass of the secondary salt around the primary heat
exchanger allowed the plant to be operated with
constant steam and reactor inlet temperatures and with
an essentially constant secondary salt cold leg tempera-
ture for loads between 20 and 100% of design load. The
maximum deviation of the cold leg temperature from
its design value of 850°F was about 8°F. Allowing the
steam temperature to increase with decreasing load
permitted the plant to operate with constant reactor
inlet and secondary salt cold leg temperatures over the
same power range. The maximum increase in steam
temperature was to approximately 1110°F, occurririg at
50% load.

Properties

for field use.

transfer of a hydrodynamic entrance length (I/d = 130)
ahead of the heated section. This will be accomplished
by alternating flow in a 48-in.-long tube, only half of
which is used to transfer heat to the molten salt. The
need for such an investigation arises from results of the
earlier studies which were made without an entrance
length and which suggested that, in the low transitional
flow range, developed turbulent flow was not achieved
at high heat fluxes; hence, significant variation in local
heat transfer coefficient with position along the test
section was observed.

It is also planned to study the effect of wetting on
heat transfer by variation in oxidation state of the salt
through addition of a metal such as uranium and to
monitor the wetting characteristics during operation by
a bubble pressure technique.

Thermophysical Properties. — A technique has been
developed that can be used to determine the contact
angle at-a fluid-solid-gas interface by measuring the
pressure difference between the liquid and gas as the gas
bubble grows slowly on the tip of a capillary tube
immersed in the liquid. The contact angle can be related
to the ‘radius of attachment of the bubble to the
capillary tube and to a reduced pressure difference
which depends on the predictable behavior of the
 

 

bubble. Experiments using water on stainless steel

(wetting), water on Teflon (partially wetting), and
mercury on stainless steel (nonwetting) have verified
the validity of the method, which will be used to
monitor wetting characteristics of the molten salt in the
next series of heat transfer experiments.

Mass Transfer to Circulating Bubbles. — Mass transfer
coefficients for helium bubbles in a 2-in.-diam pipe have
been obtained for three glycerol-water mixtures (corr-
esponding to Schmidt moduli of 419, 2015, and 3446)
over the Reynolds modulus range from 4 X 10° to 1.8
X 10°. The coefficients were found to increase with

increasing bubble diameter in the range from 0.02 to
0.05 in. mean bubble diameter and, for a 0.02-in.
bubble, to approach a nearly constant value charac-
teristic of that for bubbles rising through a quiescent
liquid at low values of the Reynolds modulus.

PART 3. CHEMISTRY
8. Fission Product Behavior

The transport paths and lags of noble metal fission
products in the MSRE have been examined using all
available data on the activity ratio of two isotopes of
the same element, 39.6-day !°3Ru and 367-day °°Ru.
Data from graphite and metal surveillance specimens
exposed for various periods and removed at various
times, for material taken from the off-gas system, and
for salt and gas samples and other materials exposed to
pump bowl salt, were compared with appropriate
inventory ratios and with values calculated for indicated
lags in a simple compartment model. This model, as
implied in earlier reports, assumes that salt rapidly loses
ruthenium fission product. formed in it, some to
surfaces and most to a separate mobile “pool” of noble
metal fission product, presumably particulate or colloi-
dal and located to an appreciable extent in pump bowl
regions. Some of this “pool” material is deposited on
surfaces, and it appears to be the source of the off-gas
deposits. All materials sampled from or exposed in the
pump bowl appear to receive their ruthenium activity
from the pool of retained material. Adequate agreement
of observed data with indications of the model has

xiv

resulted when holdup periods of 45-90 days were

assumed.

Short exposures to fuel salt in the MSRE pump bowl
ranging from 10 min to 10 hr were made with graphite
and metal specimens in a capsule specially designed to
avoid contamination of the specimens by particulate

activities in the gas space above the fuel salt. A variation
(decrease) of deposition rate with time was noted only
for the noble metal fission products and 31, with the
rate leveling off to the long-term rate in less than 10 hr.

Surface roughness over a range from 5 to 125 pin.
RMS was found to have no effect on deposition of
fission products on both graphite and metal specimens
exposed in the core of the MSRE. The low depositions
of salt-soluble fission products probably proceed by the
mechanism of fission recoil. The high depositions of
noble metal nuclides, with rates independent of surface
roughness, are best explained as being controlled by
diffusion through a stagnant film of fuel at the solid
surface. However, each species appears to have a
different sticking coefficient, and these are different for
graphite and metal surfaces. Some surface concentra-
tions of ®°Sr were found to be lower than interior
concentrations in the graphite specimens, as previously
observed for !37Cs. In both cases, the mechanism
probably involves diffusion of the metal toward the
salt-graphite interface after deposition in the interior
when the rare gas precursors decayed.

A kinetic model was enunciated which accounts for
the origin of smokes and mists generated by the MSRE
fuel. Results of laboratory and reactor experiments
were found to be consistent with the model.

Development of synthesis procedures for the noble
metal fission product fluorides and oxyfluorides was
continued. These materials were used in studies of the
valence of niobium and molybdenum as fluorides and
of their stability at low concentration in molten
Li,BeF,, and in Raman, absorption, and spectro-
photometric studies of the pure compounds.

Raman spectra of crystalline MoFs were obtained;
assignment of the spectra was successful in accounting
for both the number and intensity of the observed
crystal components.

9. Properties of the Alkali Fluoroborates

The solubility of boron trifluoride in molten LiF-
BeF, mixtures was determined. The magnitude of the
enthalpy of solubility indicates that strong chemical
interactions occur in the melt. Investigations were
continued to determine the extent to which chemically
bound hydrogen, in low concentrations, will be retained
in molten fluoroborates. Initial results of the applica-
tion of Raman spectroscopy in molten NaBF, con-

firmed that the tetrahedral tetrafluoroborate anion is

essentially the only anionic species in the melt. The
electronic polarizability of the tetrafluoroborate ion
was reevaluated because of recent inconsistencies in

literature reports and was found to. have a constant
value of 3.06 A® + 2% in each of the alkali tetra-
fluoroborates NaBF, , KBF,;, RbBF,, and CsBF;.

10. Physical Chemistry of Molten Salts

Investigations of liquid-solid phase equilibria in the
systems LiF-BeF, CeF3 and CeF4-ThF, advanced to
the point that tentative phase diagrams of the systems
could be constructed. Investigations of the stability of
PuOF showed that this compound is less stable than has
been indicated in previous literature reports. The heat
of solution of PuF; in the MSBR carrier salt was
estimated from experimental data as AH; = 11,008 +
237 cal/mole.

The effects of oxidizing and reducing agents on the
solubility of protactinium oxides in LiF-BeF,-ThF,-
UF, were examined. Major differences in the solubil-
ities of Pa(IV) and (V) were observed. The entropies of
several fluorides of importance in molten-salt reactor
technology were derived, based on currently available
thermodynamic and crystallographic data.

A new conductance apparatus was designed and
constructed in which only metal contacts the molten
salt under study. Experimental values for glass transi-
tion temperatures were measured for the first time with
fluoride melts. The glass transition temperature in the
system NaF-BeF, was found to be 117 + 2°C and to be
invariant with composition. Correlations of electrical
conductivities were derived for molten LiF-BeF,-ThF,
mixtures, relating specific conductance with composi-
tion, Investigations of coordination effects on uranium-
(IV) spectra were extended to comparé melt spectra
with crystal spectra. Very good agreement was found
with fluoride-rich melts, which suggests identity of
species in both the molten and crystalline state,

11. Chemistry of Molten-Salt Reprocessing Technology

Procedures were devised and tested for the removal of
fluoride ion (as a contaminant) from molten LiCl
solvent. It was established that essentially complete
fluoride removal (<40 ppm) could be achieved. At-
tempts to employ NaCl and KCl as diluents for "LiCl
acceptor salt in order to minimize the discard rate for

"Li were made. Studies of the distributions of sodium

and potassium for both the fluoride/bismuth and
chloride/bismuth extractions indicated, however, that
such alkali metal chlorides would not serve satis-
factorily for this purpose. Preliminary experimental

evaluations with zeolites indicate that these materials
are potentially useful for the removal of rare earths

Xv

from lithium chloride. Further evaluation of zirconium
platinide as a removal agent for rare earths indicated
that if the method reaches the plant stage, it will be
necessary to control operating conditions carefully so
that only zirconium is removed.

12. Development and Evaluation of Analytical Methods
for Molten-Salt Reactors

Three samples of MSRE fuel taken during the last
power run of the reactor have been spectrally examined
in the hot-cell spectrophotometric facility. Forced
exposure of the first two samples to the atmosphere
was a result of faulty sample containers. These two
samples showed no U(IV) or U(II) spectra. The third
sample, which was transferred to the spectral furnace
under inert atmosphere, showed the presence of U(IV)
but no U(III). It was possible, however, to generate
U(III) in this sample by both radiolytic and chemical
means. The hot-cell facility was also used to obtain the
spectra of Pa(1V), Pu(Ill), and Cm(Ill) in LiF-
BeF,-ThF,.

Studies were continued on the Ni/NiF, reference
electrode which uses single-crystal LaF; as an ionic
conductor. The characteristics of the electrode were
improved through incorporation of an internal melt,
but a small “junction” potential is still present. The
potential of the electrode is not affected by large
changes in U(III) concentrations in the melt under test.
Additional kinetic measurements were also made on the
Ni/Ni(II) couple.

Investigations of NaBF, have been concerned with
analyses of the salt and its cover gas. A method was
developed for the determination of free fluoride in the
eutectic coolant. The determination of the chemical
state of water in the salt is a problem which is still being
studied. Refinements of established methods for water
analysis have been made in an attempt to solve this
problem.

Analysis of the cover gas for the coolant salt has been
concerned with the measurement of impurities, particu-
larly BF; hydrolysis products, and the investigation of
possible methods for their removal. Modifications in the
off-gas system of the NaBF, Circulating Test Loop
allowed a study to be made of the effluent con-
taminants. Injection of water into the loop produced an
oily liquid in the effluent trapping system which
appears to be BF; hydrates, but no water was detected
in the effluent gas stream. The results of a small-scale
experiment set up to simulate the water injection into
the loop showed that water reacts with the coolant gas
and is not carried into the effluent at low temperatures.

A system is being set up to find possible adsorbents to
remove impurities from the coolant gas stream. Another
system was also set up to measure BF; as it is stripped
from saturated fluoride salts by sparging with helium.
Calibration of this system revealed an anomalous
behavior of BF;. Measurements indicate that the
viscosity of BF; varies with pressure even though P-V-T
relationships indicate that BF; should approach ideal
behavior under the conditions of the measurements.

A thermal convection salt "loop is being constructed
for the study of the effect of U(III) concentrations on
fuel salt characteristics. A new, more versatile voltam-
meter is being fabricated for use on this project. It is
planned to automatically control the voltammetric
analysis of U(IIl) with a newly acquired PDP-8/I
computer.

13. Examination of MSRE Components

The radiator tubing was found to have an oxide film
of about 2 mils on the outside. The microstructure was
modified to a depth of about 5 mils on the inside (salt
side), but we attribute this change to absorption of
lubricant during tube manufacture rather than to
corrosion, The inlet thermocouple well had a crack in
the root pass of the weld that penetrated about 3 mils
and went almost completely around the weld. This
crack was likely formed when the weld was made due
to the poor fitup of the parts to be welded. The weld
did not show any evidence of corrosion but did show
the modified surface structure that we attribute to cold
working,

14. Graphite Studies

Evaluation of some vendor-furnished graphites and
ORNL fabricated materials is continuing. Three results
of potential significance have been obtained during the
present report period.

First, preliminary results are available on black-based
graphites. It had been anticipated from earlier work at
Gulf General Atomic and Battelle Northwest that these
materials would show marked response to damage.
Conversely, the HFIR irradiations to date on
graphitized black materials have shown a high degree of
stability, Irradiations are continuing.

Second, despite microstructural changes which cause

a marked loss of impermeability for pyrolytically
impregnated base graphites, the pyrolytically coated

materials have shown only minor permeability changes:

to fluences of 1.5 X 1022 neutrons/cm? (E> 50 keV).
These irradiations are also continuing, biit they strongly

xvi

suggest the more stable base graphite will tolerate
pyrolytic coating for permeability control.

Third, we have received vendor-supplied graphites
which show microstructures similar to the best-behaved
graphites we have hitherto examined and, .in addition,
are capable of fabrication in usable sizes. The irradi-
ation behavior of these materials has not yet been
ascertained but will certainly be informative.

Additionally, two new projects have been initiated.
Samples are being readied for irradiation to follow the
effects of damage on thermal conductivity under MSR
conditions. Also, a program on raw material chemistry
and its effect on carbonization and graphitization has
been initiated. The technique of carbonization under
centrifugation and thin-film chromatography have been
demonstrated to be useful at least as diagnostic tools.

15. Hastelloy N

We found that a modified composition of Hastelloy N
containing 1.2% titanium formed stacking fault pre-
cipitates during aging. These precipitates increased the
strength and decreased the fracture strain in the
unirradiated condition, but had little effect upon the
properties of irradiated material. Postirradiation creep-
rupture tests on alloys modified with Ti, Nb, and Hf
have been run. Generally, the laboratory melts have
better properties than small commercial melts. A study
of the effects of various preirradiation anneals has
shown that the optimum postirradiation properties
result from a 1-hr anneal at 1177°C (the standard mill
anneal for Hastelloy N). Several small commercial melts
containing small additions of Ti, Hf, and Nb have been
welded with weld wire from the same heats. All alloys
were weldable except those containing relatively large
amounts of hafnium (>0.7%) and zirconium (>0.4%).
Creep-rupture tests on these same alloys have been run
at 650 and 760°C. They are stronger than standard
Hastelloy N under all conditions investigated. Electron
microscopy of these alloys has shown that the charac-
teristic fine carbide dispersions developed in laboratory
heats containing hafnium are not formed in commercial
alloys containing hafnium,

Corrosion studies of Hastelloy N in sodium fluoro-
borate continue to show a marked deleterious effect of
water on the corrosion rate. Hastelloy N samples
exposed to steam in the unstressed condition continue
to show low corrosion rates after 10,000 hr of
exposure. A duplex tube consisting of Incoloy 800 and
nickel 280 is being evaluated for possible use in the
steam generator.

16. Support for Chemical Processing

The design and fabrication of components for a
molybdenum reductive extraction test stand have con-
tinued. In addition to welding and brazing, mechanical
couplings are being evaluated as a joining technique.
Commercially available molybdenum tubing was pro-
cured for the connecting lines of the loop. Two end-cap
geometries for the 3%-in.-diam heat pots and upper and
lower column disengaging sections have been fabricated
by back-extrusion, and material properties are being
evaluated.

Welding parameters for tube-to-header and tube-to-
tube joint designs have been developed using the
electron beam and the gas tungsten arc processes.
Welding will be used to provide corrosion-resistant seals,
and back-brazing will provide joint strength. An experi-
mental filler metal of Fe-Mo-Ge-C-B (42M) appears to
be the most corrosion-resistant braze we have developed
thus far. No attack was observed after testing in static
bismuth for 644 hr at 600°C.

Tantalum plus T-111 and molybdenum plus TZM
showed excellent resistance to mass transfer in sepa-
rate quartz thermal convection loops circulating bis-
muth at 700°C for 3000 hr. Molybdenum also showed
excellent resistance to bismuth containing 100 ppm
lithium in a similar 3000-hr test. However, chemical
analysis of the bismuth did indicate some slight
dissolution of molybdenum. Severe mass transfer of
an Fe—5% Mo alloy occurred in bismuth after only
423 hr.

CVD tungsten coatings adhere to Ni, Ni-base alloys,
Fe—35% Ni and Fe—50% Ni alloys, and nickel-plated
stainless steels. The coatings remain adherent after
thermal cycling and bend tests and have bond strengths
greater than 20,000 psi. Vessels of practical sizes have
been uniformly coated. Satisfactory CVD molybdenum
coatings have been applied to Inconel 600 and
Hastelloy C at 900°C.

Molybdenum was deposited on stainless steel by an
exchange reaction between MoF4 dissolved in molten
LiF-BeF, and the constituents of the stainless steel.
Several layers were found in addition to molybdenum,
indicating that deposition should be conducted at lower
MoF¢ concentrations.

17. Flowsheet Analysis

Additional calculations were made to identify the
important operating parameters and to determine opti-
mum operating conditions for a flowsheet that uses
fluorination—reductive extraction for isolation of prot-

xvii

actinium and the metal transfer process for rare-earth
removal,

Calculations were also made to investigate the oper-
ation of an oxide precipitator for removal of uranium
from fuel salt from which protactinium had already
been removed. The results indicate that greater than
99% of the uranium can be removed with a small
number of stages in a countercurrent system and that
the oxide stream produced will have a UO, concentra-
tion of greater than 90%. Less than 1% of the thorium
fed to the system would be precipitated with the
uranium. ’

18. Measurement of Distribution Coefficients
in Molten-Salt—Metal Systems

Chemical studies in support of the development of a
metal-transfer process for removing rare-earth and other
fission products from single-fluid MSBR fuels were
continued. Additional data were obtained on the
distribution of rare earths and thorium between liquid
bismuth solutions and molten LiCl, LiBr, and LiCI-LiF.
These data confirmed previous indications that the
distribution behavior of most elements was not
markedly affected by temperature variation and that
contamination of the acceptor salt with fluoride fuel
salt reduces the thorium-—rare-earth separation factor.
The results of one experiment involving the extraction
of europium from LiCl indicated that distribution
coefficient data obtained with low concentrations of
lithium in the bismuth phase can be extrapolated to
include bismuth solutions having lithium concentrations
as high as 35 at. %. The solubility of neodymium in a
liquid lithium-bismuth solution that contained 38 at. %
lithium was found to be higher than that reported for
pure bismuth. The solubility of LaOC1 in molten LiCl at
640°C was found to be very low.

Oxide precipitation methods are being considered for
use in the isolation of protactinium and uranium from
MSBR fuel salt. It was shown that protactinium could
be selectively precipitated from LiF-BeF,-ThF4-UF,
(71.7-16-12-0.3 mole %) by addition of oxide to the
system after the salt had been extensively hydro-
fluorinated. Calculations based on equilibrium data
available in the literature showed that, under certain
conditions, it will be possible to precipitate (as UO,) a
large fraction of the uranium from MSBR fuel salt with
little attendant precipitation of ThO,.

19. Engineering Development of Process Operations

Experimental work in the flow-through reductive
extraction facility was continued after the original

 
 

 

xviii

packed column had been replaced with a modified
column packed with *-in. Raschig rings. Three suc-
cessful hydrodynamic experiments in which bismuth
and molten salt were contacted countercurrently were
carried out with the new column. The flooding data
obtained agreed well with a flooding correlation de-
veloped earlier from the study of a mercury-water
system. A set of pressure drop measurements was made
with only salt flowing through the column; these
measurements will be used for future comparison to
detect possible iron deposition in the column. Uranium
was added to the LiF-BeF,-ThF, salt in the form of an
LiF-UF, eutectic in preparation for mass transfer
experiments with uranium, The first mass transfer
experiment resulted in essentially no transfer of ura-
nium as the result of an error in adding thorium
reductant to the bismuth prior to the run. The second
experiment, UTR-2, was the first successful demon-
stration of the reductive extraction of uranium into
bismuth in a flowing system. Greater than 95% of the
uranium was extracted into the bismuth phase, which
initially contained a 140% stoichiometric excess of
reductant.

A report describing the conceptual design of the
molybdenum reductive extraction system is being
written. Welding and brazing have been selected as the
methods for assembling the molybdenum vessels and
piping. Conceptual full-size layout, head pot, and
equipment support drawings have been prepared. A
Y;-scale model of the molybdenum equipment and
piping has been built. A fullsize transparent plastic
mockup of the bismuth head pot and the upper part of
the reductive extraction column has been installed for
testing with mercury and water. A gas pulse pump is
being developed as a possible replacement for the
gas-lift pumps considered thus far.

Measurements were made of pressure drop, dispersed-
phase holdup, and flooding during the countercurrent
flow of mercury and water in a 2-in.-ID column packed
with %-in. Raschig rings. The data on holdup and
flooding for %-in. Raschig rings, as well as those
reported earlier for %-in. Raschig rings and solid
cylinders and for %-in. Raschig rings, can be correlated
in terms of a constant superficial slip velocity which is a
function of packing size only. A simple relation has not
been found for correlating the pressure drop data. An
expression based on the mercury-water data is given for
predicting flooding and dispersed-phase holdup in
packed columns through which salt and bismuth are in
countercurrent flow.

Measurements of axial dispersion in packed columns
during the countercurrent flow of fluids having high

densities and a large density difference have been
continued. These experiments, which use mercury and
water, are intended to simulate the behavior of bismuth
and molten salt. Data are reported for %-in. Raschig
rings, ¥-in. solid cylinders, and %-in. Raschig rings.
These and previously reported data indicate that the

"axial dispersion coefficient is independent of the

dispersed-phase flow rate for %- and % -in. packing but
is inversely proportional to the continuous-phase flow
rate for ¥ -in. packing.

Data are reported on the effects of the column and
gas inlet diameters on axial mixing in open columns in
which air and water are in countercurrent flow. The
dispersion coefficient was found to be independent of
the gas inlet diameter for diameters of 0.04 to 0.17 in.
At high gas flow rates, little difference in dispersion
coefficient was found at a given gas flow rate in
columns having diameters of 1%, 2, and 3 in. At low
gas flow rates, dispersion coefficients were essentially
the same for the 2- and 3-in.-diam columns; however,
the results obtained for the 1%-in. column were
significantly lower.

The first metal transfer experiment for study of the
removal of rare earths from single-fluid MSBR fuel salt
has been completed. Approximately 50% of the lantha-
num and 25% of the neodymium originally in the
fluoride salt were extracted; however, the rare earths
did not collect in the lithium-bismuth stripping solution
as expected. The distribution coefficients for lantha-
num and neodymium between the fluoride salt and the
thorium-saturated bismuth were relatively constant and
were in agreement with expected values. The distri-
bution coefficients for lanthanum and neodymium
between the chloride salt and the thorium-saturated
bismuth were higher than anticipated initially but
approached the expected values toward the end of the
experiment.

Calculations were made to show the effects of coil
current, frequency, temperature difference, and fluori-
nator diameter on the frozen film thickness in a
continuous fluorinator heated by high-frequency in-
duced currents. A fluorinator fabricated from 6-in.
sched 40 pipe containing a 5-in.-ID coil that had two
turns per inch was tentatively chosen for an experiment
to demonstrate corrosion protection by use of a frozen
wall. The calculations indicated that a frozen film
having a thickness of 0.3 in. could be maintained over
the coil with a temperature difference of 51°C across
the film if a coil current of 11 A at 400 kHz were
used. A 9.2.kW generator would be required for a
5-ft-long fluorinator under the assumed conditions.

Although a maximum stable film thickness exists,
there appears to be no serious control problem, since
the thickness of the frozen film changes rather slowly.
Because of uncertainties in the calculations, a simulated
fluorinator is being built to permit the study of heat
generation and heat transfer. A 30% HNO; solution will
represent molten salt in the system.

Two experiments related to electrolytic cell develop-
ment were performed. The first was carried out in an
all-metal cell to determine whether quartz used in
previous tests contributed to the formation of black
material in the salt. No black material was seen during
the experiment; however, we now believe that the
absence of the black material is probably due to the
absence of a bismuth cathode rather than to the
absence of quartz. This conclusion is supported by the
results of a second experiment, which was carried out in
a quartz cell.

The second experiment allowed us to study the
reduction of lithium from pure LiCl using a bismuth
cathode. This may provide a method for recovering

xix

lithium from salt discard streams from the metal
transfer “process. The cell, which used a rounded
graphite anode, was operated at anode current densities
up to 8.6 A/cm? Chlorine disengaged readily from the
anode. During the passage of current, the LiCl became
red; we believe that this color change was caused by the
dissolution of LiyBi that was present on the cathode
surface. It is possible that the dark material noted
earlier in’ cells resulted from the reaction of Liz Bi with
BiF; in the salt to form finely divided bismuth.

20. Continuous Salt Purification System

Ten flooding runs were carried out with molten salt
(66-34 mole % LiF-BeF,) at salt flow rates ranging
from 50 to 400 cm®/min. Five of the runs were made
with argon at flow rates up to 7.5 liters/min, and five
were made with hydrogen at flow rates up to 30
liters/min. At the maximum flow rate (about 19% of
the calculated flooding rate), a pressure drop of 40 in.
H, O was observed across the packed column.

Part 1. Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment

The MSRE remained shut down, awaiting postopera-
tion examination. Component development was con-
cluded with the termination of the pump endurance
tests. Analysis of information from the MSRE con-

tinued; some results are reported here, experimental
physics results are given in Part 2, and the fuel
chemistry is discussed in Part 3 of this report.

1.1 CHRONOLOGICAL ACCOUNT
R. H. Guymon A. Il. Krakoviak

The conditions that were established in January!
were maintained throughout nearly all of this report
period. The only departures were temporary heating of
the reactor vessel neck and experimental cooldown of
the drain tanks, as described below. Normal conditions
are briefly as follows. The fuel salt is divided between
the two drain tanks. It and the flush salt are frozen but
held at around 500°F by tank heaters to preclude
fluorine evolution. The rest of the salt systems are at
ambient temperature. Heat from the tanks is dissipated
through the cell walls without the use of the cell
coolers. All salt systems are filled with helium at about

valved off. Reactor and drain tank cells are sealed
except for a small purge of air that goes through them,
out past a monitor, and up the stack. Signals from the
few key instruments are telemetered in ORNL mon-
itoring centers, and the reactor building is locked and
unattended except on regular workdays.

Activities at the site, in addition to routine daily and
weekly log-taking, included planning and preparation
for the postoperation examinations? and identification

and listing of items that will not be needed and will be
made available for use elsewhere.

An abrasive cutoff tool to be used semiremotely was
built and tested. A heavy-duty shear was procured, and
a special grinding tool for excising the fuel pump
sampler cage was designed and built. The only exami-
nation tasks that were actually done were the removal
of some sections of radiator tubes and the thermo-
couple wells in the 5-in. coolant salt lines. The radiator
tubes were sawed out uneventfully, with no problems
either from beryllium contamination or radioactivity.
Because cramped access made grinding dangerous, the
thermocouple wells were removed by electric-arc
cutting. (Examinations of the radiator tubes and
thermocouple wells are reported in Part 5 of this
report.) A backlog of high-priority work resulting from
the April-June labor strike fully occupied ORNL craft
forces, making it necessary to postpone the start of the
major part of the MSRE examinations from July until
October.

In preparation for the removal for the first time of
the 10-in. reactor vessel access plug with attached
control-rod thimbles, the reactor access nozzle was
heated. Temperatures around the annuli where salt had

been deliberately frozen during operation were raised to
above 1000°F for two days; then the heaters were again
turned off.

In August the heaters on one drain tank were turned
off temporarily to determine the salt temperature that
would result. (This was of interest because of the strong
temperature effect on recombination of fluorine pro-
duced by radiolysis of frozen salt.) Temperatures fell
slowly from the initial SO0°F and leveled off after
about 15 days. The temperature in a probe at the center
of the tank reached 240°F, while thermocouples on the
outside of the tank read 200 to 205°F.

1.2 OPERATIONS ANALYSIS

1.2.1 Gamma Spectrometry

A.Houtzeel F.F.Dyer J.R. Engel

A large amount of data relative to fission product
behavior in the MSRE was collected with the aid of a
remote gamma-ray spectrometer during the final
months of reactor operation.® Primary evaluation of
these data has been concluded, and review and final
editing of a detailed report® of the findings are in
progress. Since only selected parts of the MSRE system
(heat exchanger, fuel salt line, off-gas line, and fuel salt
in a drain tank) could be studied with the spectrometer,
we did not expect to develop a complete description of
the fission product behavior. Instead, we anticipate that
the results will provide a body of data that can be
combined with information from other sources to
produce a more complete picture.

In spite of the limited scope of this investigation,
some specific aspects of fission product behavior have
been extracted from the results; a summary of these
findings is given below. Because of the volume of data
involved, quantitative results will be presented only in
the topical report.*

Primary Loop. — A significant fraction of the
inventory of noble-metal fission products (Nb, Mo, Ru,
Rh, Sb, Te) was deposited on metal surfaces in the
primary loop. The deposits in the primary heat ex-
changer were nonuniform, with heavier deposits near
flow baffles. The degree of nonuniformity was different
for different atomic species, ranging up to a factor of
2.5 for some elements. Although only semiquantitative

data were obtained for the 5-in. piping, there appeared
to be no gross differences in the deposition densities in
the heat exchanger and those in the connecting piping.

Several iodine isotopes were identified in gamma
spectra obtained from the heat exchanger after the salt
had been drained. However, only those isotopes that
have precursors with significant half-lives were found,
implying that the iodine appeared only as a result of the
decay of deposited precursors, antimony and tellurium.
The absence of '3'I (precursor half-life <2 min)
indicates that any iodine that was formed while the
heat exchanger was full of salt was quickly transferred
to the salt phase,

Measurements made soon after the fuel salt was
drained from the loop indicated that fission product
gases were a major contributor to the total activity level
for several hours. Thus in future systems, where fission
product decay heating may be significant, provisions
will be required for elimination or rapid removal of
such products. -

Off-Gas Line. — Gamma spectra from the off-gas line
with the reactor at power showed, as expected, that the
major activity sources were gaseous fission products and
their associated decay products. However, with the
reactor shut down and the gases purged out, we
observed a substantial contribution from the noble
metals. Among the species identified were Nb, Mo, Ru,
Rh, Sb, and Te. In contrast, very little activity was
observed for species that would be expected to remain
in solution in the salt.

1.2.2 Noble-Metal Migration
R. J. Kedl

An analytical model based on conventional mass
transfer theory and the heat/mass transfer analog was
developed to describe noble-metal migration in the
MSRE. A brief description of the theory and some
correlations based on the model were reported earlier,’
using data from gamma scans of the primary heat
exchanger after run 14 (last 235U run) and fuel salt
samples taken during runs 14, 17, and 18. Since then,
numerous fuel salt samples, gas samples, core sur-
veillance specimens, and gamma scans of the heat
exchanger and other components have been taken.
Essentially all of these measurements have been ana-
lyzed in the framework of mass transfer theory.

The concept of the physical processes involving noble
metals in the fuel salt upon which the analytical model
was based is as follows. Noble metals are born,
uniformly dispersed in the salt, as single reduced atoms
directly from fission and from decay of their pre-
cursors. They are unstable in fuel salt; that is, they are
insoluble or only slightly so, and they may even be
unwet or only slightly wet. Hence they tend to migrate
out of the fuel salt and deposit on surfaces. Apparently
they are stable on Hastelloy N and graphite surfaces,

since they have been found there in significant quan-

tities. These conditions are sufficient for mass transfer
theory to be applicable.

In addition to the solid surfaces, observations have
shown that the off-gas system is also a sink for noble
metals. The mechanism for this is unclear, but analysis
of fuel salt samples and other considerations suggest
that liquid-gas interfaces serve as sinks for noble metals.
It is known that small bubbles circulate with the fuel
salt; presumably they pick up noble metals and carry
them to the pump bowl. The pump bowl, with a salt
surface churned by the xenon stripper jets,® acts as a
froth flotation chamber. The only conditions required
for the froth flotation process to work are that (1) the

particle be slightly wet by the fluid (contact angle
<180%) and (2) the particles are small enough so that
their mass will not carry them under the surface
(gravity forces less than surface tension forces). Noble-
metal particulates probably satisfy both of these con-
ditions. The pump bowl presumably then accumulates
and holds noble metals on its large surface area. Bubbles
are continuously being generated and disintegrating in
the turbulent pump bowl. Bursting bubbles are known
to generate a mist of liquid, and a very small amount of
fuel salt is always found in the gas samples. This is
apparently the mechanism that carries noble metals into
the off-gas system. A noble-metal scum on the liquid
surface would also account for the large amount of
noble-metal contamination found on the outside of the
salt sample capsules.

Using this mass transfer theory but ignoring the
effects of migration to the circulating bubbles, the
amounts of noble metals deposited on the surface of
the heat exchanger were computed and compared with

those measured by gamma scan spectroscopy after run
19. The results appear in Fig. 1.1 along with the more
limited data taken after run 14.° The volume fraction
of circulating bubbles in the fuel salt was estimated to
be 0.023 to 0.045% during run 14 and 0.5 to 0.6%
during run 19. Qualitatively, then, the data are con-
sistent; that is, if noble-metal migration to bubbles were
considered in the “calculated value,” the denominator
would be lowered more rapidly for run 19 than for run
14, and the two curves would approach each other.
Quantitative reconciliation is more difficult. If esti-
mated values of the bubble surface area and mass
transfer coefficient were used, the denominator of both
curves would be lowered so that the ratios would be far
greater than 1.0. Now in these calculations the “sticking
fraction” has been assumed equal to 1.0 for all surfaces.
This is probably reasonable for Hastelloy N, but it may
be considerably less than 1.0 for a gas-liquid interface.
A sticking fraction could probably be assigned to the
bubbles that would bring the two curves together.

The foregoing analysis is typical of numerous others
that have been made for other locations and other
times. A report presenting all the analytical work on
noble-metal migration in the framework of mass
transfer theory is currently being written.

1.2.3 Radiation Heating
C. H. Gabbard

The temperature differences between the reactor inlet
and the lower head and between the reactor inlet and
the core support flange were monitored as an indication
of any sedimentation buildup within the reactor vessel.
The final tabulation of these temperature differences
presented previously” suggested a slight increasing trend
in the temperature rise of the core support flange
during operation on 233U fuel. The reactor vessel
temperature data for runs 17 through 20 were reviewed
to determine if an indication of sedimentation actually
existed. The increase in core support flange AT for run
20 was found to have been present when the reactor
was first taken to power, apparently as a result of
thermocouple error caused by slight differences in
heater settings between runs 19 and 20. (The reactor
vessel thermocouples were not rebiased at the beginning
of run 20.)

The fuel drains on November 2 and December 12,
1969, provided further evidence that sedimentation did

"MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 28, 1970, ORNL-
4548, p. 15.

not exist. The run 19 drain (on November 2) occurred
immediately after full-power operation, and the run 20
drain (on December 12) was less than 1 hr after
full-power operation. The temperature response of the
reactor vessel thermocouples following these drains was
essentially the same as for other fuel and flush salt
drains, and there was no indication of a fission product
heat source.

1.2.4 Fluorine Evolution from Frozen Salt
P. N. Haubenreich

In-pile capsule tests showed in 1962 that irradiation
of frozen fuel salt could result in evolution of F, gas.
These and other experiments® showed that recombina-
tion of the F, with the salt was strongly temperature
dependent, becoming significant above 80 to 100°C.
Analysis of the data from these experiments was
recently extended® to obtain quantitative relations that
could be used to define more precisely the conditions
necessary to prevent fluorine evolution from the frozen
MSRE salt.

The yield of F, varied up to about 0.07 molecule per
100 eV of absorbed energy, depending on the physical
state of the salt and perhaps on the type of radiation.
For the in-pile capsules, where the salt composition was
like that of the MSRE fuel and the radiation was from
included fission products, the most accurately measured
value of yield was 0.020 molecule of F, per 100 eV. In
some in-pile capsules which were distinguished mainly
by slower cooling and freezing, the yield was practically
Zero.

Although recombination was observed in some in-pile
capsules, the best-defined relation between recombina-
tion and temperature was observed in experiments in
which simulated MSRE fuel salt at a controlled tem-
perature was exposed to ®°Co gamma rays.'® After
considerable F, was generated the source was removed
and the rate of pressure decrease was used to compute
the rate at which F, was reentering the salt. The results
are plotted in Fig. 1.2. The equation of the straight line
which was empirically fitted to the data is

In some of the in-pile capsules it was observed that
generally a substantial amount of energy was absorbed
before fluorine began to be released from the salt into
the gas. A similar “induction period” phenomenon was
observed in the ®°Co experiments. In these experiments
3 X 10%? eV/g (1.3 Whr/g) was absorbed before F,
release was evident.

The radioactivity of the MSRE fuel salt after the
December 1969 shutdown was calculated by Bell,!?
taking into account the power history and removal of
various fission products by gas stripping and deposition.
Figure 1.3 shows the energy sources associated with the
4.6 X 10° g of fuel salt as a function of decay time.
With the fuel in the large drain tanks, practically all of
this energy will be absorbed. or

recombination vs temperature were combined to de-

termine minimum temperatures at which all the radio-
lytic F, would recombine internally. The required
temperature (based on 0.020 molecule per 100 eV)
decreased slowly from 173°F in January 1971 to 145°F
in January 1975. The required temperatures would be
higher by only 15°F if a yield of 0.04 molecule per 100
eV were used.

The induction period observed in the ®°Co experi-
ments is long compared with the rate of energy
absorption in the MSRE fuel salt. If the MSRE fuel
were chilled in January 1971, it would be over 30
months before 1.3 W/g was absorbed.

During the interim between the end of nuclear
operations and the scheduled examinations it was a
simple matter to keep the tank heaters on and the salt
much warmer than necessary to recombine all the F,
internally. Based on the foregoing analysis, it appears
feasible to turn off the heaters (except perhaps for a
few days each year) without fear of fluorine evolution
during the interval between the postoperation exami-
nations and the ultimate disposal of the MSRE salt.

was shut down after 16,680 hr of operation with
molten salt. During the early part of the report period,
two more incidents of partial plugging! of the purge gas
system were experienced, one in the shaft annulus and
one in the pump tank nozzle connecting to the off-gas

system. Both plugs were cleared by the application of
additional heat and did not reoccur.

Upon shutting down the pump and attempting to
drain the system salt, it became evident that the line
which connects the salt piping to the storage tanks had
become plugged, and the salt could not be drained. All
the salt in the system was then frozen except for that in
the pump tank and in three pressure transmitters. At
the end of the report period, procedures were being
developed to remove the drain line, to determine the
location and nature of the plug, and to replace the line
so that the salt could be thawed and drained into the
storage tanks.

water supply line to the lubricant cooler, and in view of
the cessation of the operation of the MSRE and the
suspension of activity in the MSBE salt t pump program,
the test was not resumed.

Part 2. MSBR Design and Development

R. B. Briggs

For the past several years the program of the MSBR
design and development activities has been to prepare a
reference design for a 1000-MW(e) one-fluid MSBR
plant; to design a molten-salt breeder experiment
(MSBE), operation of which would provide the data
and experience necessary to build large MSBR’s; and to
develop the components and systems for the MSBE.
Work on the reference design for the one-fluid MSBR
was begun in October 1967 and has taken most of the
effort. Results of the studies were reported in our
semiannual reports for the periods ending in February
and August 1968 and 1969 and February 1970. The
draft of a topical report that describes the plant and the
results of the studies in considerable detail has been
completed, is being reviewed, and will be published in a
few months. Some preliminary work on the design of
the MSBE, activities related to the development and
procurement of equipment for the MSBE, and some
more general development have also been described in
the progress reports mentioned above.

Earlier this year the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission
decided that the Molten-Salt Reactor Program should
concentrate on obtaining solutions to the major tech-
nological problems of molten-alt reactors and demon-
strating them in the laboratory and in test loops instead
of building and operating the MSBE for this purpose.
Although this decision did not affect much of the
design and development work in progress, it required
considerable changes in future plans.

We will continue with design studies of large molten-
salt reactor plants because these studies serve to define

generally the technology that requires development and
the extent to which development goals are being
achieved. Some studies of a 300-MW(e) demonstration
plant are described in this report. Progress is being made
on plans for a design study of a 1000-MW(e) MSBR by
an industrial contractor. This study is intended to
provide an industrial version of an MSBR and an
industrial assessment of the technology and the poten-
tial of molten-salt reactors. We also plan to continue
some design studies of the major systems and equip-
ment for the MSBE. Much of the testing and demon-
stration of the engineering technology should be done
on a scale relevant to reactors that may be built in the
near future, The MSBE studies will help to establish the
scale for the development and some of the more
detailed requirements.

In the development program we have curtailed the
work on procurement of pumps and steam generators
for the MSBE. Design studies and some basic develop-
ment will be done on steam generators because they
present some special problems and none have been built
and operated even on a small scale. Plans are being
made for loop facilities for testing components of the
xenon removal system, the off-gas system, and other
features of the fuel salt system. A loop facility is also
being planned for developing the technology for the
coolant salt system. Some development of maintenance
systems and equipment is continuing. In all this work,
emphasis is being placed on providing solutions to
major problems of equipment and.processes that have
been defined by the design studies.

The final draft of the report! covering the study of a
1000-MW(e) single-fluid MSBR power station has been
distributed at ORNL for comment and review. We
expect the report to be ready for publication early in
1971.

A description of a primary drain tank cooling system
using NaK as the heat transport fluid has been added to
the report draft. As discussed in Sect. 3.2.6, an
NaK-cooled system is believed to have important
advantages over the previously described LiF-BeF,-

3.2.1 Introduction

Whereas past moltensalt breeder reactor design
studies have been based on plants of 1000 MW(e)
capacity, and for cost estimating purposes have assumed

Reactor Design Study, ORNL-4541 (to be issued).

2MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 28, 1970, ORNL-
4548,

an established molten-salt reactor industry, there is
interest at this time in the general design features and
estimated cost of a first-of-a-kind prototype reactor
that would precede construction of a large-scale plant.
A logical size for this demonstration plant would
probably be between 100 and 300 MW(e).

Studies of molten-salt reactors have shown the fuel
cycle cost to be somewhat independent of the nuclear
characteristics; that is, a relatively low fuel cycle cost of
less than 1 mill/kWhr can be achieved with a high or
low power density core and with or without the ability
to breed more fissile material than is consumed. The
penalty for operating the reactor as a converter rather
than a breeder, therefore, is not so much one of a
higher cost to produce electric power in the near term,
but rather one of reduced conservation of the nation’s
fissile fuel resources and the consequent effects on
power production cost in the long term. Important
present benefits of operating molten-salt reactors as
converters are that the neutron damage flux can be
made low enough for the core graphite to last the
30-year life of the plant and thus not require replace-
ment, salt velocities in the core can be in the laminar
region to eliminate the need for sealed graphite to
reduce '3%Xe poisoning, and the reactor can be
operated with less salt processing. These aspects would
allow a molten-salt reactor power plant to be built in
the near future on a more assured technical and
economic basis. Such a reactor would provide valuable
data and experience for design and operation of
large-scale breeder reactors.

On the basis of the above considerations, a prelimi-
nary study has been initiated of a 300-MW(e), or 750
MW(t), molten-salt converter reactor suitable for a
demonstration plant. The reactor would have a conver-
sion ratio above 0.8, an assured graphite life of 30
years, and would substitute periodic fuel salt replace-
ment for a continuous salt processing facility.

Results of the early phases of the study are reported
below. No cost estimates have been made to date. As in

Pl

previous studies, the design presented is not represented
as being the most practical or economical but as one
which indicates that a feasible arrangement exists.

3.2.2 General Description

As may be seen in the simplified flowsheet, Fig. 3.1,
the basic arrangement of the demonstration reactor is
much the same as in the large-scale breeder reactor
designs. Heat generated by fissions in the ?LiF-BeF,-
ThF,-UF, fuel salt as it passes through the graphite-

-moderated and -reflected reactor core is transported by

the circulating salt to the primary heat exchangers for
transfer of the heat to a sodium fluoroborate coolant
salt. The coolant salt is, in turn, circulated through the
steam generators and steam reheaters. Supercritical-

pressure steam is produced at 1000°F and is supplied to

a conventional turbine-generator. Reheat is to 1000°F,
and a regenerative feedwater heating system furnishes
high-temperature water to the steam generators.

Three primary salt and three secondary salt circulat-
ing loops were selected for the demonstration plant
rather than the four employed in previous MSBR
conceptual design studies. In neither, however, has the
number of loops been optimized. Each secondary loop
has two steam generator units and one reheater.

3.2.3 Buildings and Containment

As shown in Figs. 3.2-3.7, the major components of
the primary system are housed in sealed, biologically
shielded cells within a domed confinement building.
The building is about 92 ft in diameter, with a total

height above grade of about 114 ft, and terminatesina

flat bottom about 40 ft below grade. The building wall
consists of a steel shell having a 2-ft thickness of
concrete on the outside of the dome and greater
thicknesses, both inside and out, in the lower portions.
While this sealed building provides a third line of
defense against escape of airborne radioactive contam-
inants during normal operation of the plant, its primary
function is missile and tornado protection. However,
when the containment cells are opened for maintenance
purposes during reactor shutdowns, the building may
temporarily serve as the primary barrier to escape of
contaminants.

The sectional elevation of the reactor building is
shown in Fig. 3.7. The building is supported by an
8-ft-thick flange extending about 30 ft from the
cylindrical wall of the building at an elevation about 40
ft from the bottom. The flange rests upon a prepared
foundation on the bed rock. This arrangement lowers

the center of gravity of the structure relative to the
support point and is being studied to determine
whether it provides a more stable arrangement during
seismic disturbances, particularly in that many of the
heavy components of equipment are in the upper
portion of the building. The three lobes which project
from the building to contain the steam-generating cells
(see Fig. 3.5) are also supported by the flange.
Investigation of this building arrangement is not
intended to imply that the demonstration reactor
presents special problems with regard to support of
equipment. The heavy components could rest on
essentially the same stands and supports now planned
even if the building were of a more conventional design.

The reactor cell is about 34 ft in diameter and 59 ft
high, as shown in Figs. 3.5 and 3.7. As with all the
other cells containing highly radioactive materials, the
cell wall is made up of two concentric thick-walled steel
tanks to provide double containment with a monitored
gas space in between. Gas is circulated within the wall
to remove the internally generated heat. The cell roof is
not designed for easy removal of the reactor core, as in
the MSBR designs, but openings are provided to make
the required in-service inspections of the vessel and for
maintenance of the three fuel salt circulating pumps
installed above the reactor vessel.

One of the three primary heat exchanger cells is
shown in Figs. 3.5 and 3.7. These cells are about 23 ft
in diameter and 22 ft high. They communicate directly
with the reactor cell; that is, they share the same
atmosphere, but they were made separate in order to
provide better shielding during heat exchanger mainte-
nance operations and to simplify cooling of the reactor
thermal shield. The U-shell, U-tube primary heat ex-
changers are mounted horizontally, with one leg above
the other, with access to the heads through plugged
openings in the cell wall.

The primary drain tank is located in a cell at the
lowest level of the building, as indicated in Fig. 3.2, to

_assure gravity drain of the fuel salt. The heat sink for

the drain tank cooling system is located outside the

“confinement building, however, as will be discussed in

Sect. 3.2.6. Another storage tank for the fuel salt, used
if maintenance is required on the primary drain tank, is
also located on the lowest level in a cell designated for
chemical processing equipment.

A large space is provided directly beneath the reactor
cell for storage of discarded radioactive equipment and
to house the tanks used to store spent fuel salt and
fission product gases from the off-gas system. In the
case of the latter it should be noted that the bulk of the
fission product gases are recycled to the fuel salt

Space is also provided in the building for the service
areas needed for the primary heat exchangers. Rooms
for auxiliary systems, control, and instrumentation have
been indicated. The building may be larger than
necessary in that the initial study emphasized conven-
ience in the layout and seismic protection rather than
optimization of building space and costs.

3.2.4 Reactor

As indicated in Fig. 3.8, the general configuration of
the demonstration reactor is similar to that used
successfully in the MSRE. A conceptual study of an
essentially identical design, as used for a 1000-MW(e)

molten-salt converter reactor, has been described previ-
ously. The reactor vessel is fabricated of Hastelloy N
and is about 26 ft in diameter X 32 ft high and has a
wall thickness of about 2 in. The core is made up of
graphite elements 4 X 4 in. in cross section with a
central hole and flow passages on the four faces to
provide channels for the upward flow of fuel salt. The
dimensions of the holes and passages are varied as
necessary to provide three regions of different salt-to-

graphite ratio, while at the same time proportioning the
flow to give approximately the same total temperature
rise of 250°F for the salt flowing through the core. The

18

flow velocity is in the laminar region; hence the

“graphite will probably not require sealing to keep the
xenon penetration within tolerable levels. Graphite grid
plates are used at the top and bottom to retain the core
elements in position as the graphite dimensions change
with thermal expansion and neutron irradiation effects.
A 2Y,-ft-thick graphite reflector around the core is used
to improve the neutron economy and to protect the
vessel from radiation damage. As previously mentioned,
the relatively low power density of about 10 W/cm? in
the core will permit the graphite to last the expected
30-year life of the plant. Since the graphite will not
require replacement, the vessel is not designed with a
removable head, as in previous conceptual designs.

The basic design and nuclear performance data as now
known are listed in Table 4.1.

3.2.5 Primary Heat Exchangers

The three horizontal primary heat exchanger units are
the U-shell, U-tube type shown in Fig. 3.9. The fuel salt
enters at 1300 and leaves at 1050°F, while the coolant
salt enters at 850 and leaves at 1150°F. The fuel salt
flows through 1390 Hastelloy N U-tubes, '% in. OD X

31 ft long, to provide an effective surface of about
5650 ft? per exchanger. Each leg of the U-shell is 30 in.
ID and about 13 ft long.

The heat exchangers are of a design different from
those previously proposed for molten-salt reactor sys-
tems because the maintenance scheme is not based on
replacement (from above) of an entire tube bundle if a
leak should develop in a unit. Instead, plans are to
operate from the side to remove the exchanger heads
and to locate and plug faulty tubes. As shown in Fig.
3.5, plugged openings are provided between the heat
exchanger cells and the exchanger service area. These
areas are equipped with remotely operated welding and
cutting equipment, viewing devices, etc., to cut the
inversely dished heads from the exchangers to expose

the tube sheet at each end. Leaks can be detected by

visual observation or by gas pressurization of the

“secondary system and acoustical probing. Remotely

operated cutting and welding equipment is being
developed for use in making repairs.?

3.2.6 Primary Drain Tanks

The Hastelloy N tank used to store the fuel salt when
it is drained from the primary circulating system is
about 10.5 ft in diameter X 20 ft high, as shown in Fig.
3.10. The tank has sufficient capacity to store all the

fuel salt plus the amount of coolant salt that could
credibly find its way into the fuel system in event of
heat exchanger tube failures. The drain tank is located
in the drain tank cell at the lowest level in the building
(see Fig. 3.2).

During normal operation a small amount of salt
overflows from the primary circulating pumps into the
drain tank, and the fission product gases removed from
the circulating system also pass into the drain tank for
holdup and decay. Heat generation from these sources
is estimated to be about 6 MW(t). Although the salt
would not normally be suddenly drained into the tank,
a major leak in the primary system could make this
necessary. In this event the afterheat released in the
drain tank could be about 18 MW(t), but the rate would
decrease by one-half in 15 min and by two-thirds in 3

“to4 hr.

As in previous designs, jet pumps are installed in the
bottom of the drain tank to transfer the salt to the fuel
circulating system, to the fuel salt storage tank
mentioned below, or to a chemical processing system if
required. The jets are operated by a small auxiliary salt
circulating pump.

20

The flowsheet for the drain tank cooling system has
been included in Fig. 3.1. Heat is transported by a
sodium-potassium eutectic (NaK) circulated through
400 thimbles which hang in the stored salt from the flat
top head of the tank. The thimbles are fabricated of
2Y%,-in. sched 40 Hastelloy N pipe. The layout of the
thimble penetrations in the tank head is shown in Fig.
3.11, and a detail drawing of the construction at a
penetration is shown in Fig. 3.12. Each thimble
contains a 2%-in.-OD X ¥-in.-wall tube which, in turn,
contains a 17% ¢-in.-OD X Y% ¢-in.-wall tube. The NaK
enters, flows to the bottom through the inner tube, and
then returns upward through the annulus between
tubes. About 5100 ft? of effective heat transfer surface
is thus provided. The annulus between the 2 -in.-OD
tube and the thimble is filled with gas, the major
portion of the heat being transferred by radiation from
the thimble wall to the NaK-filled tube. This arrange-
ment provides a double barrier between the fuel salt
and the NaK and also an intervening gas space that can
be monitored for leakage.

The thimbles are manifolded at the top of the tank

. into 40 separate circuits. The Nak circulates by natural

convection through these circuits to 2-in.-OD tubes that
run horizontally through a 25-ft-square water-filled
tank located about 60 ft above the drain tank level and
outside the containment building, as shown in Fig. 3.5.
The tubes are installed inside 2%-in. pipe to provide a
double barrier, with a monitored gas space, similar to
that used in the drain tank. The effective heat transfer
surface is about 30,000 ft?, and, as in the drain tank,
the heat is transferred primarily by radiation across a
gas-filled annular space. The water in the pool would be
circulated and cooled as required. Should the water
supply be interrupted, the water would boil. The tank
capacity, however, is sufficient to provide about three
days of heat removal capacity at the maximum required
rate. An auxiliary supply of makeup water could
undoubtedly be established in the interval.

During initial warmup of the reactor system it is
desirable to reduce the heat losses from the drain tank

system. Electromagnetic pumps installed in the NaK-
filled riser pipes can be operated in reverse to reduce
the thermal convection flow during the startup phase.

The drain tank is installed inside another tank, as
indicated in Fig. 3.10. The outside tank, or “crucible,”
is a precaution against a leak developing in the primary
drain tank vessel. The outside tank is of double-walled
construction with an internal partition to form two
separate NaK circulation circuits for cooling the vessel
wall. If salt leaks into the outside tank, the heat would
be removed by this system. During normal operation,
heat is transferred by radiation to the outside tank to
cool the wall of the primary drain tank.

3.2.7 Fuel Salt Storage Tank

A storage tank must be provided for the fuel salt in
the event that the primary drain tank must be repaired,

it not being feasible to store the salt in.the reactor
system during the operation. The storage tank can also
be used for fluorinating a spent fuel salt charge to
“recover the uranium before the. salt is sent to the

22

separate discard tanks and for adding UF and H, toa

fresh charge of carrier salt to reconstitute the fuel salt
. for the system.

The Hastelloy N storage tank is about 10 ft in
diameter and 25 ft high. Plan and elevation views are
shown in Figs. 3.13 and 3.14, and the location of the
tank inthe building is indicated in Figs. 3.2 and 3.7.

The heat release from a fuel salt charge in the storage
tank is relatively low, since the activity will have
decayed in the primary drain tank prior to transfer.
Assuming a 30-day decay period, the heat load on the

  

DISPOSAL CANS (45)

TO AND FROM

storage tank cooling system should be less than 1
MW(t). This amount of heat can be transferred through
the tank wall to the NaK-cooled wall of an outside tank
which surrounds this vessel in an arrangement similar to
that used for the primary drain tank.

The corrosion of the tank during the fluorination
process is of greatest concern at the liquid-gas interface.
The design has not yet been studied in depth, but the
thickness of the tank wall can be made sufficient for
the anticipated number of fluorinations required.

3.2.8 Discard Salt Storage Tanks

order of seven to eight years, depending on the amount
of chemical processing available. Provisions must there-
fore be made in the demonstration plant for removal,
treatment, and long-term storage of three to four spent
fuel-salt charges. Before storage the uranium would be
recovered by fluorination in the storage tank, as
discussed above.

The preliminary design concept shows each discarded

salt charge stored in 45 cans, 2 ft in diameter X 10 ft
high, arranged vertically in concentric circles around the
fuel salt storage tank, as shown in Figs. 3.13 and 3.14.
(The location of the cans and the storage tank is
indicated in Figs. 3.2 and 3.7.) All the cans are
connected in series through 1l-in. pipes, the salt being
transferred by gas pressurization of the storage tank.
Gas blowback can be used to clear the interconnecting
piping of salt. The cans are cooled by radiation of heat
from the surfaces to concentric containers having
NaK-cooled walls. After sufficient decay time has
elapsed, the discard tanks can be cut apart using
remotely operated tools, the tank nipples can be welded
shut or otherwise sealed, and the filled tanks can be
transferred to the storage cell beneath the reactor or to
another approved storage site. A new set of salt discard
tanks would then be installed to receive the spent fuel
salt charge to follow.

3.2.9 Steam System

The steam power system associated with the demon-
stration plant has not been studied in detail, but in
general it may be said that the coolant salt would
probably transfer its heat to the supercritical-pressure
steam system delivering steam to the turbine throttle at
1000°F, with reheat to 1000°F. The regenerative
feedwater heating system would probably be very
similar to that proposed for the 1000-MW(e) MSBR
power station.! The net thermal efficiency of the cycle
would be about 44%.

3.3 AFTERHEAT TEMPERATURES IN EMPTY
MSBR HEAT EXCHANGERS

J. R. Tallackson

MSBR heat exchangers must be able to withstand the
temperatures developed by afterheat from some frac-
tion of the noble metal fission products® which plate
out on metal and graphite surfaces. Normally this
afterheat presents no difficulties, as it is easily removed

SMSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 28, 1969, ORNL-
4396, sect. 5.8.

24

by continuing the circulation of secondary salt after the
primary salt is drained. An entirely different situation
will exist, albeit unlikely, if both primary and second-
ary salt systems are rapidly drained immediately after
reactor shutdown. This afterheat must then be removed
by radiative transfer, and the heat exchangers should be
designed to withstand the temperatures required to
effect transfer.

Temperatures developed in MSBR heat exchangers
during the radiative transfer of afterheat have been
calculated. The calculations covered four sizes rated at
94, 141, 188, and 281 MW and having scaled-down
construction generally similar to the 563-MW unit in
Fig. 5.6, p. 58 in ref. 3. These calculations, fairly
detailed and extensive, are being reported in ORNL-
TM-3145.°

It was assumed that 40% of the noble metal fission
products (see Fig. 5.8, curve B, p. 60, ref. 3) will
deposit uniformly inside the heat exchanger tubes and
that no heat will be transferred by conduction through,

- or convection of, the gases in the exchanger. The

radiative transfer calculations used the method outlined
by Sparrow and Cess® for diffuse radiation in multi-
surface enclosures. In the enclosure forming the tube
annulus, the tube layout was considered to be con-
centric rings of tubes with each ring a single surface.
Emissivity of the internal surfaces is expected to be
from 0.1 to 0.3. Steady-state calculations were made
with the heat production rates expected 10* to 10° sec
after reactor shutdown. By considering the heat capac-
ity of an empty exchanger, an approximate initial
‘transient was inferred, and it appears that peak temper-
atures will be developed in from 2 to 4 hr after
shutdown. Figure 5.15 shows typical steady-state tem-
perature profiles, with emissivity a parameter, in a
141-MW exchanger at the heat rate expected 10° sec
(2.8 hr) after shutdown. This size heat exchanger is of
interest since its size is appropriate for an MSBE.

From these calculations, it has been concluded that:

1. the heavy intermediate shell adjacent to the outer
shell is an effective radiation shield and that its
removal will produce a worthwhile reduction in peak
temperatures,

the reduction, 5 to 15%, in internal heat generation
resulting from gamma energy escaping outside the
exchanger has little effect on peak temperatures;

3.4 INDUSTRIAL STUDY OF 1000-MW(E)
MOLTEN-SALT BREEDER REACTOR

M.I. Lundin J. R. McWherter

Preparations are nearly complete for issuance of a
request for proposals for an industrial study of a
1000-MW(e) MSBR. Internal reviews and approvals of
the request for proposal package have been obtained,
and the package has been submitted to AEC-RDT for
review. A preliminary expression of interest has been
received from some 26 industrial firms.

The study, to begin in FY 1971, will consist of several
sequential tasks. The first task is the development of a
concept for a 1000-MW(e) reactor plant which will have
a chemical processing plant based on information
furnished by Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The
second task is the evaluation of the effects of various
parameters on the power production cost. Other tasks
include the study of a modified plant concept having a
chemical processing plant proposed by the contractor
and the recommendations by the contractor for the
molten-salt program research and development effort.

 

 
 

 

 

4. Reactor Physics

4.1 PHYSICS ANALYSIS OF MSBR
4.1.1 Fixed-Moderator Molten-Salt Reactor

H. F. Bauman

Molten-salt reactor concepts designed for a first
generation of commercial power reactors were
presented in a brief survey in the last semiannual
report.! From this study we have drawn several
important conclusions:

1. A breeder reactor with fixed (nonreplaceable) mod-
erator can be designed within the present limitation
on graphite fast-neutron exposure. It could be in
essence a scaleup of the MSRE. The breeding gain
and power cost would be comparable with the
reference single-fluid MSBR ; however, because of its
lower power density and higher fissile inventory, it
would be only about half as effective in conserving
fissile fuel resources.

2. Molten-salt reactors require continuous processing
for breeding, but not necessarily for generating
low-cost power. A reactor with the simplest possible
batch processing, in which the salt is discarded after
removing the uranium by fluorination, has an
estimated fuel-cycle cost comparable with the refer
ence MSBR and a conversion ratio above 0.8.

3. A reactor in which the core moderator consists of a
random-packed bed of graphite spheres, while
probably the simplest to construct and maintain, has
inherently an unfavorable salt-to-moderator ratio,

leading to a higher fissile inventory and higher

fuel-cycle cost than for a prismatic core.

In light of the above conclusions, in the current half
year we have concentrated our analytical work on
prismatic, fixed-moderator core designs. We have
studied the effect of core zoning on the fast (damage)
flux distribution and the effect of salt composition on

26

the performance of fixed-moderator breeders and have
begun to study a prototype reactor [about 300 MW(e)]
with batch processing. We have developed an improved
procedure for calculating the average performance of a
reactor with batch processing.

Fixed-Moderator MSBR. — Several of the more
important parameters affecting the performance of the
fixed-moderator single-fluid MSBR were investigated.
As in other recent breeder studies, the conservation
coefficient? was taken as the figure of merit. Several
preliminary cases showed that processing cycle times of
10 days for 233Pa removal and 25 days for rare-earth
removal (as suggested by the Chemical Technology
Division for the metal transfer process) gave good
performance, and these were adopted as standard for
this study. The optimization provision of the ROD code
was used to adjust the dimensions and salt fractions in
three core zones (in spherical geometry) to optimize the
flux distribution. The salt composition, in particular the
thorium concentration, was studied in a parameter
survey. Calculations were run in parallel for 1000- and
300-MW(e) plant sizes to provide information in a size
appropriate for a prototype reactor as well as for the
standard size.

The reactor model consists of three core zones
surrounded by a salt annulus and a 2% -ft-thick graphite
reflector. The code may vary the core zone thicknesses
and volume fractions to determine the optimum flux
distribution consistent with a 30-year core life. For the
1000-MW(e) cases, the optimum fast (damage) flux
distribution was perfectly flat across zone 1, dropping
off in the other zones. For the 300-MW(e) cases, where
neutron leakage is more important, the optimum flux

distribution was flattened but still peaked at the center
of the core.

Results from a series of cases in which the thorium
concentration was varied from 10 to 18 mole % are
given in Table 4.1. The nominal composition of each
salt is given in Table 4.2. The ROD calculation as used
in this study is capable of adjusting the core parameters
to give a nominal core graphite life of 30 years within
+2%. Most of the cases fell within these limits; however,

27

three of the cases terminated with greater deviations:

(up to 7%) from the desired nominal core life. Rather
than expend additional computer time to adjust the
core life, the results of all cases were adjusted to an
equivalent 30-year core life on the basis of the
following assumptions:

1. the peak damage flux is inversely proportional to the

core volume,

the breeding ratio is unaffected by small changes in
the core volume,

the in-core fissile inventory is directly proportional
to the core salt volume.

The core dimensions, fissile inventory, conservation
coefficient, fuel yield, and fuel-cycle cost were adjusted
in accord with these assumptions, making the cases
directly comparable while introducing only negligible
error as long as volume adjustments were small.

The conservation coefficient is plotted as a function
of thorium concentration in Fig. 4.1. The optima lie in
the range 14 to 16 mole % thorium for the 1000-MW(e)
plant and 15 to 17 mole % thorium for the 300-MW(e)

plant. The optima based on fuel yield, as shown in Fig.
4.2, lie in about the same ranges. The fuel-cycle costs,
shown .in Fig. 4.3, decrease with increasing thorium
concentration for the 300-MW(e) plant, mainly because
of the decreasing fuel salt fraction in the core and
consequent fuel salt inventory. This behavior results in
part from the fact that the reactor design for each value
of thorium concentration is optimized with respect to
the fuel conservation coefficient rather than with
respect to fuel-cycle cost. The fuel-cycle costs for the
1000-MW(e) plant are very flat but begin to turn up
beyond 16 mole % thorium. The fuel-cycle costs are
based on the same economic assumptions as for the
reference MSBR.

Calculations for Batch Processing. — In our past
studies of molten-salt breeder reactors we have assumed
equilibrium fuel composition and continuous processing
— good assumptions for high-power-density reactors
which reach . equilibrium rather quickly. Relatively
low-power-density reactors (in which the radiation-
exposure life of the moderator graphite is equal to the
service life of the plant) are likely to have a lower fuel
specific power and therefore to reach equilibrium more
slowly, so that the mode of startup is not negligible in
calculating the average performance over the lifetime of
the reactor. Further, reactors in which the fuel is
processed batchwise at intervals of several years do not
achieve a breeding gain of unity and therefore require
and are sensitive to a fissile feed.

Codes for calculating the time-dependent (i.e., non-
equilibrium) behavior of MSR’s have been available to
us for several years, though each has been subject to

some limitations or restrictions. For comparison with
our equilibrium-fuel-cycle calculations, we have found
it useful to employ ROD (our equilibrium reactor code)
for nonequilibrium, batch-processing cases by estab-
lishing an approximate equivalence between the fuel-
cycle times for a continuous processing case and for a
batch process. We can then use ROD to simulate the
average performance over the duration of the batch
cycle or over as many batch cycles as may be expected
in the lifetime of the reactor.

To obtain an average performance over a reactor
lifetime, it is necessary to supply ROD with a time-
weighted average fuel composition. (The feed rate and

as 23°Pu, may be adjusted slightly by ROD to attain
criticality.) For this purpose we have used a one-group,
zero-dimensional, time-dependent code written several
years ago by R. S. Carlsmith, which we have adapted
for the IBM 360 computer and have named HISTRY.
With average reaction rates per nuclide taken from any
space-energy-dependent code (such as ROD), HISTRY
can calculate the concentrations and inventories of the
nuclides in the fuel chain over the reactor lifetime.

We have amplified the HISTRY code by adding a
computation of the lifetime-average nuclide concen-
trations, which, in turn, can be input to ROD to
calculate lifetime average reaction rates for use in
HISTRY. We have also divided the “neutron poison” in
HISTRY into two groups: a fixed poison, to represent
the neutron absorptions in such. constant absorbers as
the moderator and the carrier salt, and a lumped fission
product poison, which may be allowed to build up as a
parabolic function of time, if desired. We have further
augmented the HISTRY code to permit the explicit
calculation of any number of batch cycles; in the
revised code the plutonium nuclides, for example, may
be permitted to build up throughout the cycle and be
removed for the start of the next cycle. The fission
product poison fraction may be represented as a
parabolic function reset to zero at the start of each
cycle.

In summary, we require reaction rates per nuclide,
from ROD, as input for the HISTRY code, and we need
time-averaged concentrations over the reactor, from
HISTRY, as input for ROD. Thus an iterative process is
involved, which we find converges very satisfactorily in
about two passes so that further iteration produces
trivial changes in either ROD or HISTRY results.

To obtain an average performance over one or more
batch processing cycles it would be necessary to supply
ROD with the time-weighted average concentration for
each fission product absorber. However, ROD already
has the capability of calculating the concentration of
each fission product for a given removal rate (i.e., for
continuous processing). Much of the versatility of this

"calculation could be retained if the equivalent average
removal rate for batch processing could be related to
the continuous removal rate inherent in the ROD
calculation. This relationship, the “b/c ratio,” may be
thought of as the ratio of the batch cycle time to the
equivalent continuous processing cycle time for each
fission product poisoning on the average. It must be a
number between 1.0 and 2.0, where 1.0 is the limit for
rapidly saturating nuclides (which rise quickly to a
"saturation concentration and remain there over most of
the cycle) and 2.0 is the limit for nonsaturating nuclides

(which rise in concentration linearly throughout the
cycle). A series of ROD cases was run with continuous
processing times ranging from 0.25 to 16 years to
determine the fission product buildup for the
300-MW(e) reactor, and b/c ratios were estimated from
the saturation characteristics as exhibited in the curves
of equilibrium poisoning vs continuous processing rate.
It was found that the b/c ratios for most nuclides did
not change much over the range of processing times of
interest (say, 2 to 8 years), and it appeared reasonable
to group most of the 200 nuclides together with a single
average b/c ratio. However, three nuclides were suffi-
ciently different from the average in buildup that we
elected to assign them separate b/c ratios. They are
143Nd, **?Sm, and ! 5! Sm. The resulting b/c ratios for
these three nuclides (based on their buildup in concen-

Prototype Fixed-Moderator MSR. — Previous studies
in the molten-salt program have generally concerned
full-scale breeder reactors or relatively small reactor
experiments. We have begun a study of a reactor design
for a first commercial molten-salt reactor power station,
that is, a prototype MSR in the size range of 100 to 500
MW(e). We have selected a fixed-moderator prismatic
core design with batch processing because this would
require a minimum- development of téchnology beyond
that demonstrated in -the MSRE. We have based the
study on - the reactor ‘configuration of the best
300-MW(e) case with continuous processing given in
Table 4.1 (case 202). Thus even though the prototype is
designed as a converter with batch processing, the
addition of continuous processing at any time would
make it a breeder with the performance indicated for
case 202. Parameters such as the batch cycle time, the
salt composition, the feed material, and the plant size

are being investigated using the techniques described in

the preceding section. From the cases which have been
studied so far, a sample case [300 MW(e), with

lifetime fuel composition and conversion ratio for this

4.2 MSR EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS

4.2.1 %33U Capture-to-Absorption Ratio in the Fuel
of the MSRE

G.L. Ragan

The capture-to-absorption ratio for 233U, which we
call y;, has been determined for the circulating
233U.type fuel of the MSRE; the value (an average over
time, neutron energy, and position in the reactor) is v3
= 0.1098 + 0.0031. The corresponding capture-to-
fission ratio is a3 = y3/(1 — v3) = 0.1233 % 0.0039.
Taking v3; = 2.500 * 0.010 neutrons per fission in
233y, the measured v; yields n3 =»; (1 — v3) =2.226
+0.012.

Since the effective neutron spectrum in the MSRE is
similar to that in proposed MSBR designs, these values
have some interest in themselves. However, more
quantitative significance attaches to a comparison be-
tween the measured value of y; for the MSRE and that
calculated for the MSRE using the cross sections and
calculational techniques employed in MSBR design
work: y3; = 0.1092. A slight variation in calculational
technique gave vy; = 0.1077. Both values® are well
within one experimental standard deviation of the
measured value. Qur analyses have shown that an
uncertainty in 73 causes an essentially equal un-
certainty in breeding ratio and is the dominant un-
certainty. The good agreement noted encourages us to
believe that our uranium cross sections and compu-
tational methods will not, by themselves, contribute an
appreciable error in our estimates of breeding ratio for
an MSBR.

The sampling and mass spectrometer techniques used
were similar to those used earlier® to determine the
capture-to-absorption ratio for 235U in the 235U-type
fuel of the MSRE. Three sets of samples were taken of
the circulating 233 U-type fuel; about 1% depletion of
233U occurred between successive sets (designated as
sets A, B, and C). The 22 samples of the three sets were
grouped to form eight working samples: Al, A2, Bi,
B2, and C1 to C4. Five intercomparisons were made

between selected pairs of working samples. The samples

were introduced as UF¢ into a dual-aperture mass
spectrometer with electron-bombardment source.’ A

fixed slit always intercepted the beam containing 233 U,
while a movable slit intercepted another selected
uranium isotope. The slit-current ratio was proportional
(with factor undetermined) to the isotopic abundance
ratio. With a given slit setting (e.g., for 233U) final and
initial samples were alternately introduced to determine
the ratio of ratios,

Cancellation of the undetermined proportionality fac-
tor permitted precise measurement (of the order of one
part in 10%) of the ratio of ratios.

The experimental data (R3;s and R,g) were first
analyzed in the same way as were those for 235U, using
a suitable modification of Eq. (1) of ref. 5. Results were
unreasonable and highly erratic, with y; ranging from
0.4 to 0.9 times the calculated value. In addition, the
Ry data indicated® a 233U depletion rate ranging
from 1.0 to 1.6 times that expected. The behavior was
indicative of a proper relationship between 233U and
2349J in the samples but of an erratic error in the ratio
of 238U to the other two.

An exhaustive search for possible sources of sample
contamination revealed none after the samples left the
reactor, but it did reveal two that had been overlooked
in the sample-taking procedures. Each sample was taken
by lowering into the molten fuel a cylindrical capsule
having two large open windows on opposite sides near
the top. These windows might have admitted con-
taminating uranium from either or both of two sources.
First, from the walls of the 14-ft-long transfer tube,
through which the capsule was lowered. Second, from
the floor of the transfer box, where each capsule was
placed before and after lowering. In both of these
places, other sampling and enriching operations had left
significant quantities of earlier fuel samples (both 235U
and 223U types) and enriching salt (of both types).

It was determined that moderate amounts of these
contaminants (of the order of 1 mg of contaminant
uranium per gram of sample uranium) could explain the
abnormal 233U to 233U ratios observed. At the same
time, the 234U to 233U ratios would not be signifi-

* cantly upset by such contamination; this is because the

234y, and the 233U fuel and enriching salts contained
233( and 234U in about the same proportions as did
the samples. Consequently, an alternative method of
determining y; was developed that depended only on
the 234U to 233U relationships and on an accurate
knowledge of the reactor power® integral.

variation of 233U and 234U, one derives the pair of

deviation §v; was determined by calculating the effect
of 8R,43 on 7; using Egs. (2) and (3).

In addition to the statistically independent uncer-
tainties associated with §R,3, there are several uncer-
tainties that affect all measured values of vy; in a
common way. These are given in Table 4.6; they are
associated with 8S,, 8f3, and 8(N,/N;) of Egs. (2) and
(3). The four main uncertainties in f; have been listed
separately. Some items (e.g., Ng/N;) are different for
the several comparisons, but their chief uncertainty
arises from the normalization to the analytical data of
the calculation used in their determination. Hence,
these are essentially common errors.

The five independent measurements of Table 4.5 have
been used to obtain the weighted mean value given in
Table 4.7. Since the weighted statistical error and the
common error are independent, they are combined to
give the overall experimental error shown. Two differ-
ent calculated values are given. For a discussion of their
differences see ref. 4. Both are within 2% (less than one
experimental standard deviation) of the experimental
value. :

As noted above, the logged megawatt-hour values
have been multiplied by the correction factor derived
from the 235U depletion and 236U buildup experi-
ments reported earlier.® The logged value of cumulative
megawatt-hour was carefully determined by integrating
frequent readings (about 5 min apart) of a nuclear
chamber that was normalized to carefully measure heat
balance power determinations (made six times a day).

operation was the same as that finally adopted for the
235U operation and used in determining the above
correction factor. The weighted mean correction factor
so determined was 0.9175 + 0.0113.

The source of the implied error in the heat balance
power determination has not been found, despite
 

 

 

intensive search.® Although it appears to be in error as
to absolute value, the logged-megawatt-hour scale pro-
vides a precise common basis for determining the power
integrals for the 235U and 233U operations. The
standard deviation for the individual heat balance
power measurements is believed to be less than
0.5%—perhaps much less. Since each megawatt-hour
interval used in these experiments represents the sum-
mation of at least 180 statistically independent heat
balance power measurements (30 days at six per day),
the standard deviation of the sum is less than 0.04%
(0.5%/+/180). This error has been neglected in the
analysis.

The use of “kg of 233U loaded” in Table 4.6 needs
clarification. If no fuel drain occurred between taking
initial and final samples, as was the case for AB
comparisons, f3 would be defined as 233U fissions per
2330 atom in the circulating fuel at the time sample A
was taken. Circulating inventory is most accurately
determined by starting with the accurately measured
initial loading and multiplying by the ratio of circu-
Iating-loop volume to total fuel volume (partly retained
in fuel drain tanks). This volume ratio is taken as 0.919
+ 0.005, ‘and the uncertainty in this ratio should be
included in the error analysis. On the other hand, had
both A and C samples been taken immediately after the
fuel drains (mixing) that preceded them, f3; would be

8MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 28, 1970, ORNL-
4548, p. 15.

defined as 233U fissions per initial 233U atom in the
total fuel inventory, In that case the volume ratio and
its uncertainty would not be involved. The actual
situation was far more complex, and all f; values were
based on the circulating fuel inventory. An adjustment
(—928 MWhr) was made for the C samples, to account
for the mixing of undepleted drain-tank fuel with loop
fuel-which had been depleted by 11,461 MWhr of
operation at the time of the drain that preceded taking
them. The volume ratio and its uncertainty entered in
different ways for the various comparisons and even
gave different signs for the resulting uncertainties in v5.
Analysis showed that the net overall uncertainty thus
caused in vy; was only 0.05%, which was neglected.
Whereas the term “logged megawatt-hour” has the
precise quantitative meaning given above, the term
“nominal full power” does not represent a well-defined
power level. It is unfortunate that the discussion of ref.
6 was based on an assumed nominal full power. What
was actually determined by each experiment reported
was the correction factor by which the logged mega-
watt-hour should be multiplied to give agreement with
the experimental data on %2°U depletion or 23°U
buildup. The factors so determined were multiplied by

the assumed nominal full power value of 8.00 MW to

obtain the reported values of nominal full power. All
nominal full power values given there should be divided
by 8.00 MW to get the measured value for this
correction factor. Thus the final reported combined
value of 7.34 £0.09 MW (Table 6.5 of ref. 6) yields the
correction factor 0.9175 + 0.0113 used herein.

5. Systems and Components Development

Dunlap Scott

The reorientation of the MSBR program into a
technology program has resulted in curtailment of
efforts to produce components for the MSBE and
added emphasis on a program of experiments and
studies that will explore more deeply some of the
technical problems and their significance to the MSBR
design. The program for the participation of industry in
the design and fabrication of steam generators has been
reduced to provide for design studies only. The pro-
grams concerned with further study of the techno-
logical problems will center around the operation of a
gas system test loop, a secondary system technology
loop, and later a steam generator technology loop.

The gas system test loop will be constructed of
Hastelloy N and will be operated with a salt containing
lithium, beryllium, thorium, and uranium in propor-
tions representative of the fuel salt for a single-fluid
MSBR. The loop will be used to evaluate the operation
of the gas-removal systems under different chemical
states of the salt as well as to investigate other technical
areas of interest to the fuel system. We expect to
improve our confidence in the use of water as an easy
fluid for developing components which are actually to
be operated in salt. :

The secondary system technology loop, also con-
structed of Hastelloy N, will be operated with a sodium
fluoroborate eutectic to study the mechanical and

chemical features of the secondary salt system. Other

coolants may be tested in the loop in search of
alternatives to sodium fluoroborate. This loop will also

- provide salt for circulation through the steam generator -

technology loop, which will be operated to study basic
problems of molten-salt-heated steam generators.

The program for the procurement and testing .of

pumps for an MSBE has been curtailed until the
program for the construction of the MSBE is reacti-
vated.

The program for the development of equipment and
techniques for remote welding of pipe and vessel

closures has been centered around establishing the
feasibility of an automatic welding system which, by
virtue of its reliability and versatility, would be adapt-
able to remote operation. The interest in this equip-
ment has grown to such an extent that the results of
this feasibility study probably will be perfected. by
others for use in making field welds during construc-
tion, Our program will continue with a study of such
associated considerations as the remote inspection of
weld passes and remote preparation, cleanup, and
alignment for-welding. The status of the programs
which have been started is given below.

5.1 GASEOUS FISSION PRODUCT REMOVAL
C. H. Gabbard

5.1.1 Gas Separator

Water testing of the latest gas separator design’ has
continued, Although the attachment of the gas core to

“the recovery vane hub is much improved over the

previous - designs, the main vortex still tends to be
somewhat unstable in front of the recovery hub at low
gas flow rates, as shown in Fig. 5.1. At higher gas flow
rates the vortex is more stable and becomes fully
attached to the recovery hub, as shown in Fig. 5.2.
Under both of these conditions, some of the gas escapes
the vortex and bypasses the separator. Although all the
gas bubbles appear to move to the central vortex, losses

“around the recovery hub reduce the actual gas removal

efficiency to less than 100%. -

- Performance data for the gas separator have been
taken at flow rates of 440, 570, and 660 gpm of water
with gas input rates ranging up to 1.0 scfm. The

"maximum efficiency in each test occurred at the highest

gas input rate and was nominally 94, 88, and 78% for
the three water flow rates respectively. The higher
efficiency at the lower water flow rate is probably the
result of reduced turbulence at the recovery hub. The
results of the performance tests at 570 gpm are shown
in Fig. 5.3. Each of the three curves was taken with a
constant throttle setting on the gas-water takeoff line.
The inlet void: percentage for the MSBE separator,
based on an average of 0.2% voids in the loop, would be
about 0.1% but would vary depending on the operating
pressure of the separator. Although the removal
efficiency increased with increasing gas flow rate up to
1.0 scfm, the gas removal capacity of the separator is
limited, and the removal efficiency would fall off
rapidly at somewhat greater gas flow rates.

The recovery hub of the separator is being redesigned
with an annular gas takeoff port in an attempt to
improve the vortex stability and to increase the removal
efficiency at the lower void fractions.

5.1.2 Bubble Generator

The design and testing of a reduced-scale “teardrop”
bubble generator was presented previously.2 The tests
reported at that time indicated that the bubble diam-

eter was about one-fourth of the flow annulus thickness
and that an annulus of about 0.080 in. would be
required to produce the desired 0.020-in.-diam bubbles.
A multiple vane design was envisioned for the full-sized
MSBE or MSBR bubble generator to avoid the large
diameter that would be required for a “teardrop”
design with the 0.080-in. flow annulus. A reduced-scale
prototype model with a single vane is shown in Fig. 5.4.
A satisfactory bubble size was generated by this design,
but there were flow oscillations around the trailing edge
of the vane in the vertical plane and also in a horizontal
plane within each of the diffuser sections. There was
also difficulty in distributing the gas flow uniformly
across the width of the flow channels and between the
top and bottom gas feed holes.

The development tests of both the “teardrop” and
the “multivane” bubble generators have been discon-
tinued for the present time to evaluate a simpler
“venturi” design. Two commercial jet pumps with
throat diameters of 0.316 and 0.656 in. were used for
the preliminary testing. The tests indicated that a
satisfactory bubble size could be obtained in water at
throat velocities greater than about 30 fps. The bubble
size did not appear to be pressure dependent between
throat pressures of 1.47 and 2.9 psia. The only
difficulty encountered with the jet pumps was pulsa-
tions in the bubble output. The pulsations occurred
when the jet pumps were run at throat pressures greater
than about 1 to 3 psia. The suction cavity of the larger
jet pump was filled with epoxy and remachined with a
minimum gas volume in an attempt to eliminate the
pulsations. The pulsations were reduced but were not
eliminated by this change.

A larger pressure drop across the gas feed ports will
probably be required to obtain a constant bubble
output under all operating conditions.

5.1.3 Water Test Loop

A water test loop which will permit testing full-sized
MSBE bubble generators and gas separators has been
designed and is being fabricated. Figure 5.5 is a
schematic diagram of the loop. The test loop will have a
liquid flow range of 300 to 800 gpm and a gas input
capacity that will provide a maximum void fraction of
about 0.02. This loop will be used. to verify the
performance of the full-sized bubble generators and
separators in water and will also permit testing with
different fluid properties to obtain hydraulic similarity
with molten salt. Although the high surface tension of
molten salt cannot be duplicated in water, surfactants
and wetting - agents will be used in an effort to
determine the effect of surface tension on the bubble
generation and separation. The loop will also be useful
to study the operating characteristics of the separator
and generator in a closed system and to determine the
control requirements for maintaining a desired gas flow
on void fraction. -

5.2 MOLTEN-SALT STEAM GENERATOR
R.E.Helms J.L.Crowley

Steam generators for molten-salt reactors require the
development of much new technology because the
proposed heat source can be any one of several salts
which freeze at temperatures in the range of 700 to

850°F. These freezing temperatures are well above the
temperature at which water is normally admitted in
conventional steam generators. The tendency for the
salt to freeze, the large temperature gradients that can
exist in some regions of the steam generator, and the
need to provide materials that are compatible with salt
and water create problems that require special atten-
tion. Since so little is known about steam generators for
molten-salt reactors, design studies and some immediate
experiments are needed to assist in the definition of a
development program for this component.

The steam generator development program plan® as
previously formulated has been reduced in scope from
one of procurement of steam generators for the MSBE
and the testing of models in the 3-MW Steam Generator
Tube Test Stand to one of obtaining conceptual design
studies from industrial firms and of gaining some
experimental information through operation of.a small
technology loop. A discussion of these programs
follows.

5.2.1 Steam Generator Industrial Program

The major objective of this program has been changed
from the specific development of steam generators for

"the Molten-Salt Breeder Experiment to the investigation

3MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 28, 1970,
ORNL-4548, pp. 67-68.

 
 

 

 

of the basic technological problems associated with
molten-salt-heated steam generators. Design studies
from U.S. industrial firms will be requested to assist in
the definition of the development program for this
component. Therefore, as a result of the change in
objective from procurement of MSBE hardware to
development of technology, the request for proposal
package to obtain design studies from industrial firms
has been rewritten. One or two industrial firms will be
chosen on the basis of their proposal of how they
would proceed to accomplish the design studies. The
studies include four tasks, which may be described
generally as follows:

Task I: Conceptual Design of a Steam Generator for
the ORNL 1000-MW(e) MSBR “Reference
Steam Cycle”

Task II: Conceptual Design of a Steam Generator for
: the 2250-MW(t) MSBR “Alternate Steam
Cycle”

Task III: Conceptual Design of a Steam Generator for a
Molten-Salt Reactor of about 150 MW(t)

Task IV: Description of a Research and Development
Program for the Task IH Steam Generator

In Task I the industrial firm will produce a conceptual
design of a steam generator unit for the ORNL
1000-MW(e) MSBR reference design. The salt con-
ditions will be specified by ORNL. The ORNL steam
cycle requires that feedwater be supplied to the steam
generator at supercritical pressure and 700°F with full
load outlet conditions of 3600 psia and 1000°F.

For Task II the industrial firm will define changes
that it believes will improve the reference steam cycle.
These changes could result in a steam cycle with
different steam and feedwater pressures and tempera-
tures, a different steam generator design, etc.

For Task HI the industrial firm will use the con-
ceptual design chosen by ORNL from Task I or II and
show how it would modify the unit for operation in a
molten-salt reactor system of about 150 MW(t), the
power level of the MSBE.

For Task IV the industrial firm will prepare a report
describing the research and development program
necessary to assure the adequacy of the design of the
Task III steam generator.

5.2.2 Steam Generator Tube Test Stand (STTS)®

Our plan for the development of steam generators for
the Molten-Salt Breeder Experiment (MSBE) included a
facility for testing models containing full-size, full-

40

length tubes in a configuration representative of steam
generator designs for the MSBR. This facility included a
salt-circulating system with a salt heater capable of
supplying 3 MW of heat, a water purification system, a
feedwater system to provide water to the test unit at
pressures to about 4000 psi and temperatures to 700°F,
and a cooling system to remove 3 MW of heat while
letting the 1000°F supercritical steam down to atmos-
pheric pressure. A conceptual system design description
(CSDD) of this facility was written and will be
published as an ORNL internal memorandum. Further
work on this facility was suspended for the present.

5.2.3 Molten-Salt Steam Generator
Technology Loop (SGTL)

A steam generator in which molten salt is the heating
medium is an essential component in present versions of
molten-salt power reactors. There are many uncer-
tainties associated with the design, startup, and opera-
tion of molten-salt-heated steam generators. At present,
there is no experience, and there are no test facilities
that can be used to resolve the uncertainties.

The decision not to proceed in FY 1971 or FY 1972
with the 3-MW Steam Generator Tube Test Stand
(STTS) has delayed until at least FY 1975 the time that
experiments could be run in this facility. Since it is
important to begin now to develop basic steam gener-
ator technology, a Molten-Salt Steam Generator Tech-
nology Loop (SGTL) is proposed to permit proceeding
with experiments on a smaller scale. This loop will have
a capacity in the range of 50 to 150 kW and will be
used to study steady-state operation of sections of
molten-salt-heated steam generators.” A conceptual
system design description (CSDD) is being prepared for
this facility.

5.2.4 Development Basis for Steam Generators
Using Molten Salt as the Heat Source

Although no one has built a steam generator to work
by transferring heat from molten salt to water, there
has been some experience with similar systems using
sodium as the source of heat, and this experience is
continuing to accumulate. The lower melting point of
sodium, which is well below the 700 to 850°F liquidus
of the candidate salts, makes the design and operation
problem different. However, there are many similarities
which will make the experimental program for the
LMFBR useful to the molten-salt steam generator
development program. We are preparing a report which
will describe the status of the molten-salt steam
 

generator technology, show which elements of the
LMFBR program will be of use in the molten-salt
technology program, and define the areas which need
further experimental study.

5.3 SODIUM FLUOROBORATE TEST LOOP
R.B. Gallaher A.N. Smith

The fluoroborate circulation loop was operated for
478 hr during this report period. A test was run to
determine whether a small quantity (about 10 g) of
water injected into the salt in the pump bowl could be
detected by monitoring the off-gas stream for a change
in contaminant level. The test was completed, and the
loop was shut down on April 13, 1970, concluding the
current phase of the test program. Since the initial
operation in March 1968, 11,567 hr of circulating time
have been accumulated. Of this time, 10,632 hr have
been with the clean batch of salt.

5.3.1 Water Addition Test

Previous reports®+S have included discussions of the
acid fluid which has been observed in the fluoroborate
loop off-gas stream. In an attempt to shed additional
light on the fluid emission question, a water injection
test was run during the current report period. Briefly,
the procedure was to make a rapid injection of water
under the surface of the salt in the pump bowl, then to
make observations to determine what effect the injec-
tion had made on the nature and concentration of
contaminants in the off-gas stream.

A schematic diagram of the test arrangement is shown
in Fig. 5.6. The injection apparatus was connected to
the pump bowl at the salt sample access pipe. The salt
temperature was 1025°F, and the total overpressure
was 24 psig. As part of the normal operation of the
loop, a continuous purge of helium was passed down
the pump shaft to protect the oil seal region from the
BF; in the pump bowl. A small flow of BF;, slightly
diluted with helium, was added through the bubbler of
the liquid level indicator to make the partial pressure of
BF; in the mixed gases equal to the partial pressure of
BF; in the salt at the temperature in the pump bowl.
These two gas flows totaled 1500 cm®/min, of which
about 50 ¢cm®/min was BF.

From the pump bowl the gas stream passed through a
mist trap, a sintered metal filter, and a trap cooled with
wet ice, as previously described for the mist trap tests,’
and then through a trap cooled with a mixture of dry
ice and trichloroethylene (—100°F). The mist trap was
maintained at 900°F at the inlet end and 340°F at the
outlet end. A connection was installed between the mist
trap and the sintered metal filter to provide a
100-cm® /min sample flow to a Karl Fischer water
analyzer. The sample line to the water analyzer was
maintained at 250°F to reduce the possibility of
condensation. After leaving the cold traps, the gas
stream flowed at 1 fps through about 25 ft of %-in.
tubing before reaching the takeoff for the conductivity
cell feed line and the loop pressure control valve. These
lines were at ambient temperatures (80°F).

With the system at steady state, background readings
were obtained on the Karl Fischer apparatus and the
thermal conductivity cell, and collection rates were
determined by periodic weighings of the traps. Then on
April 2, 1970, helium was used to force 9.9 g of water
into the salt in the pump bowl in 20 sec. During the
injection an auxiliary flow of 100 cm?®/min of helium
was maintained through the water injection tube to
guard against plugging the tube by suck-back of salt.
Some helium (estimated <200 cm?) was also admitted
to the pump bowl through the bomb along with the
charge of water. Immediately after the injection there
was a sudden pressure rise of 4 psi. Following this,
automatic control valve action caused the pressure to

oscillate, with the maximum deviations being 3% psi -

above and 2%, psi below the control point pressure of
24 psig. About 15 min after the injection the pressure
appeared to be stabilizing, but at this time the pressure
drop across the sintered metal filter became excessive
(AP = 24 psi). The filter element was replaced, during
which time (<5 min) the gas flow was bypassed around
the cold traps. Replacement of the filter element and
associated operation of valves caused additional pres-
sure fluctuations of 4% psi above and below the
control point. At this time (33 min after the injection),
normal flow through the traps was restored, and the
pressure was level at 24 psig. The pressure remained
level until 2%; hr after the injection of water, at which
time flow through the sintered metal again became
restricted (AP = 15 psi).. Replacement of the filter
element took about 15 min. During this time the
pressure was maintained by bleeding gas through the
trap bypass line. At 3 hr 5 min after the water injection

the pressure leveled out once again at 24 psig, and
pressure control was steady for the balance of the test.
For several hours after the injection, sample flow was
maintained to the Karl Fischer water analyzer and the
thermal conductivity cell. The cold traps were weighed
periodically throughout the test, and weight gains were
recorded as grams of fluid. The mineral oil bubbler,
which is downstream of the pressure control valve, was
examined visually 24 hr after the injection, and the oil
had a cloudy appearance, as though’ it contained
suspended solids. The oil recovered its normal trans-
parent appearance with continued operation; however,
the oil bubbler walls appeared to have collected some
material. The water injection test was terminated on
April 13, 1970, after 478 hr of circulation.

After shutdown of the loop, the mist trap was cut
open for inspection. Visual inspection revealed that the
upstream side of the hot-zone filter had a dark film on
all metal surfaces but had little or no salt on it. One
gram of salt was recovered ahead of the filter as two
solid lumps. Between the two filters, 7.3 g of salt was
found. None was found on the face of the cool filter,
but its appearance suggested that salt had been dis-
lodged from the filter during handling. The trap
discharge line contained 0.23 g of black solids. No film
was found on the trap walls downstream of the cool
filter. Spectrographic analysis (semiquantitative) of
similar black solids recovered from a previous test

showed the major elements to be Fe, Cr, and Ni.
Carbon, if present, would not be detected. The mist
trap and the connecting tubing were fabricated from
304 stainless steel. Figure 5.7 shows the posttest
appearance of the upstream face of the filter elements
from both the hot and cold sections of the mist trap.

Three different techniques were used to observe the
effects of the water injection on the off-gas stream:
collection of fluid in cold traps, a Karl Fischer on-line
water analyzer, and an on-line thermal conductivity
cell. The following is a brief discussion of the observed
effects as compared with the effects which might have
been predicted.

1. The total amount of fluid collected during the test
was 4 g, distributed as follows: 2.6 g in the 32°F trap,
0.8 g in the —110°F trap, and 0.64 g in the sintered
metal filter. No solids were observed in the sintered
metal filter. Data from the trap weighings are sum-
marized in Table 5.1. The results indicate that the
collection rate increased sharply immediately after the
injection but returned to the average background rate
within about 24 hr.

It is difficult to predict the amount of material which
should have been collected in the cold traps. If the
water was all vaporized and transported out of the
pump bowl, the theoretical amount of condensate
available would be 9.9 g of water plus an estimated 3 g
of BF; which would be present in a saturated water

vd

Pa
 

solution. It is more reasonable to assume that the water
reacted with the BF; or the salt, but it is not clear as to
what the nature and quantity of the reaction products
would be. There are several possible reaction products
which could be transported out of the pump bowl in
the form of gases or mists which would condense in the
cold trap — for example, HF, HBF, and H3;BO;. If a
reaction occurred, the theoretical weight of material
could be much greater than 10 g. For example, a
stoichiometric yield of as much as 60 g and as little as
11.4 g of product could be obtained by reacting 10 g of
H,0 with BF;. In addition to the questions of degree
of reaction and identity of reaction products, there are
uncertainties regarding the amount of material which
might have been deposited in the lines between the mist
trap outlet and the cold traps, the efficiency of the cold
traps, the amount of material lost through the bypass
line while the sintered metal filter elements were being
changed, the amount of material retained by the salt,
and the material lost by reaction with the metal
surfaces in the loop and in the gas lines.

2. Sample flow was maintained to the Karl Fischer
water analyzer during the water injection and for
several hours thereafter. At no time during this period
did the instrument show an increase in the water
content of the gas. The Karl Fischer reagent would
titrate 6.7 mg of H, O per milliliter of reagent, and the
buret could be read to the nearest 0.1 ml, so that a flow
of 0.67 mg H,0 to the analyzer should have been
detectable. If all the H, O had been converted to steam,
the maximum concentration in the off-gas would have

been 250 mg of H,O per liter of gas (pump bowl gas
space is estimated to be 1.5 ft*). This would have been
equivalent to 0.4 ml of reagent per cubic centimeter of
off-gas, and a sample flow of 100 cm®/min would have
resulted in a reagent usage of 40 ml/min. If the actual
concentration had been only 1% of the theoretical, the
reagent usage would have been 0.4 ml/min, which
should have been easily detectable. After the Karl
Fischer analyzer had been taken off stream, two tests

~ were run to check the sensitivity of the analyzer to the

trapped fluid. In the first test the 1-in.-ID X 18-in.-long
Pyrex pipe cold trap containing about 0.5 g of the
condensed fluid was mounted vertically on a laboratory
bench, and the lower three-fourths of the trap was
wrapped with electrical heating tape. A small flow of
helium (about 100 cc/min) was established through the
trap, and the effluent gas stream was conducted to the
Karl Fischer analyzer by a length of %-in.-OD tubing
about 3 ft long. The trap was then heated until the
temperature of the lower end was at an estimated
400°F. At this point it was observed that the inner wall
at the upper end of the trap was wet, as though vapor
were rising from the lower heated section and con-
densing on the relatively cool upper surface. The
temperature of the upper surface is not known, but it
was probably somewhere between 150 and 250°F. With
the system at the elevated temperature, the gas flow to
the analyzer was maintained for several minutes. At no
time, however, did the analyzer show a response which
would indicate that the gas contained water or a water
derivative. In the second test some of the fluid was
taken from the cold trap and poured directly into the
Karl Fischer reagent in the analyzer. This time there
was a strong positive response.

3. After the water injection the thermal conductivity
cell showed a decrease equivalent to a drop in BF;
concentration of about 10%. The instrument returned

. to its normal preinjection reading within a few minutes.

If it is assumed that the water reacted with the BF; in
the pump bowl gas space, then a concentration drop of
100% would be theoretically possible, since the water
was capable of combining with 16 liters of BF 3, and the
normal BF; content of the gas space is 1.5 liters. Other
experiments indicate that BF; lost from the gas space is
quickly replaced by transfer of BF; from the bulk salt,
so that the brief transient which was observed is the
type of change which one might predict. It should be
noted that the feed line to the thermal conductivity cell
was downstream of the cold traps, so that many of the
condensables would have been removed.

5.3.2 Conclusions

The general conclusions from the water injection test
are as follows:

1. The injection produced an immediate increase in
the cold trap collection rate. The rate returned to the
normal background level within 24 hr. The material
collected appeared to be the same as, or similar to, the
fluid which has been routinely collected in the 32°F
cold trap throughout the course of the fluoroborate

44

circulation test program, The mass of material collected
was about 40% of the mass of water injected. Various
uncertainties in the test prevented the formation of any
meaningful conclusions as to the fate of the missing
material.

2. An on-line Karl Fischer water analyzer, which was
used to monitor the off-gas stream during and after the
injection, failed to show a positive response, although in
a subsequent test the instrument gave a strong positive
response to a sample of the fluid which had been
collected in the 32°F cold trap. This suggests that the
material was trapped in the lines upstream of the
analyzer, although none was found in the room-
temperature lines upstream of the cold traps except in
the sintered metal filter.

3. A thermal conductivity cell which was used to
monitor the off-gas stream showed a brief drop in
reading shortly after the injection. The change could be
interpreted as a decrease in BF; concentration, and
such a response would be expected if the water reacted
rapidly with a large fraction of the BF; in the pump
bowl gas space and the reaction products condensed out
of the carrier gas before reaching the conductivity cell.

5.4.1 MSBE Salt Pump Procurement

The general approach outlined in the Program Plan
for the Procurement and Testing of MSBE Sait Pumps
was approved by DRDT-Washington.

The evaluation team reviewed the additional informa-
tion supplied by Westinghouse for their proposal’ to
produce the MSBE salt pumps. In the opinion of the
team, the Westinghouse proposal indicated that they
were qualified to design and fabricate the MSBE salt
pumps. Westinghouse was informed of the decision not
to proceed with the program at the present time and
thanked for the cooperation they gave us and the work
they put into their proposal.

Although the MSBE salt pump procurement program
was delayed indefinitely, plans are being made to obtain
additional design information for MSBE and MSBR
pumps. We will obtain data on the nuclear radiation
dose and heat deposition rates to be expected in the salt

information on the rotor dynamic characteristics of
suitable rotary element configurations.

5.4.2 MSBE Salt Pump Test Stand

Early in the report period DRDT-Washington re-
viewed and provided technical comments on the Pre-
liminary System Design Description® (Title I) for the
MSBE Salt Pump Test Stand.” We then provided DRDT
with our written discussion of these technical com-
ments. All work on the Salt Pump Test Stand was
suspended indefinitely in view of the AEC decision to
redirect the efforts of the MSRP toward a technology
program.

5.4.3 ALPHA Pump

The fabrication and assembly of the water test model
of the ALPHA pump,’ which were delayed by a craft
strike of ten weeks’ duration at the X-10 and Y-12
plants, were completed at the end of the report period.
Installation of the pump into the water test stand and
electrical connections to the drive motor remain to be
completed prior to the initiation of water tests of the

pump.

5.5 REMOTE WELDING

P.P. Holz C.M. Smith, Jr.

T. R. Housley

In the remote welding program, emphasis has been
placed on developing equipment, welding procedures,
and automatic controls so that welds of nuclear quality
can be produced in many applications without direct
observation or manual adjustments. Automated cutting
and welding equipment that performs to nuclear
systems standards will be of value in the initial
construction of reactors and will also be suitable for
further development to achieve completely remote
operation for maintenance applications in high-
radiation zones. .

The welding development program is a joint effort of
the Reactor and the Metals and Ceramics Divisions. The
basic equipment for automated welding is the cutting

and welding system developed under an Air Force
contract by North American Rockwell Corporation.
During the past year we have developed and fabricated
modified equipment and controls which greatly im-
prove the cutting and welding performance.

5.5.1 Operational Prototype Equipment

The basic equipment used in the ORNL program to
develop a reliable remote maintenance system for
molten-salt (and other) reactors consists of a conven-
tional welding power supply, an electronic console
called the programmer-controller, and an orbiting
carriage which propels interchangeable cutting or
welding heads around the circumference of pipe.'®!2
With this system a different orbiting carriage is provided
for each of the following ranges of pipe sizes: 1-3 in.,
3-6 in., 6-9 in., 9—12 in., and 12-16 in. Many of the
same subassemblies and parts, as well as the cutting and
welding heads, are used in all sizes of carriages. This
assists greatly in minimizing the spare parts inventory.
Figure 5.8 shows a schematic diagram of a remote
maintenance system that includes, for future develop-
ment, means for remotely aligning, inspecting, bore
cleaning, and handling the pipe.

5.5.2 Cutting Development

Results of cutter performance tests on horizontal
pipes in the size range of the 6-9 in. carriage have been
reported previously.!!*!2 These tests were essentially
duplicated in limited trials of 1-3 in. and 3-6 in.
carriages loaned to us by the Air Force. These smaller-
diameter orbiting carriages do not have enough room in
the arms for the torsion spring-loaded links that provide
flexible gripping force in the large carriages; instead,
they use gear trains in the horseshoe-shaped arms to
provide a gripping force on the pipe. In the pipe cutting
tests, especially those with difficult-to-machine mate-
rials such as Hastelloy N, the more rigid, gear-train-
driven gripping arrangement of the smaller carriages
produced less vibration and less tool chatter and made
deeper cuts possible. However, the rigidity which helps
the cutting action can cause the gears to break when a

weld-spatter spot or out-of-round section of pipe is
encountered. Since out-of-roundness and variations in
wall thickness are controlled by piping manufacturers as
a percentage of the pipe diameter, larger pipe sizes will
have greater dimensional variation, so the rigid structure
of the gear train may not be applicable to larger
carriages.

tubing with the Air Force 1-3 in. carriage. Three orbits

thick circular saw blade: one to scribe or index, one to
cut nearly through the wall, and one to sever the tube.
No problems were encountered. The as-cut square tube
ends were satisfactory for welding.

We were not able to properly clamp the Air Force
1-3 in. carriage on a l-in. pipe. It appears that
1%,-in.-OD tubing is the smallest diameter this carriage
can handle. We have not yet attempted to make a cut

and drive rollers are slightly out of parallel, and this
prevents “true” saw blade tracking when cutting.

5.5.3 Welding Development

Welding development tests under laboratory condi-
tions continued to demonstrate clearly that our equip-
ment is capable of producing high-quality welds auto-
matically by use of programmed welding control
procedures. The incorporation of a drive motor which
adapts the torch up-and-down position in response to
arc-voltage feedback signals has provided improved
control of the torch-to-work spacing. The torch drive
control also provides a means of automatically tack
welding the edges of pipe joints prior to welding the
root pass. We developed and demonstrated an effective
welding control program for the tack welding.

Test welds on butt joints, with and without con-
sumable inserts, were made on 347 stainless steel with
very good results. For the present it appears that
insertless joints should be limited to production-type
welds where conditions can be extremely well con-
trolled. We continue to recommend use of square insert
rings for any remote welding of pipe joints where misfit
is likely to occur and commercial Y insert rings for butt
joints where satisfactory (nonprecision) fitup can be
assured.

We also performed welding tests on 6-in. sched 80
stainless pipe positioned horizontally to obtain informa-
tion on maximum production rates. The highest rate of
production of good weld with 0.045 in.-diam filler wire
was obtained under the following conditions:

Tungsten electrode ¥%. in. diameter

Passes 1 root and 9 filler
Wire feed Approx. 40 in./min
Dc amperes : 170

Torch oscillation
Travel speed

Elapsed weld time Approx. 10 min per pass,
100 min total
Total elapsed time 200 min

(including setup, interpass
cooling to 350°F, etc.)

Although good welds were produced in a few tests
under the above conditions, we are not sure that a good
weld would be produced every time at this maximum
production rate. We believe that the following more
conservative conditions provide better assurance of
consistently high-quality welds at a high production
rate.

It is possible to increase the speed of the “optimum”
procedure by shifting from 0.045- to 0.060-in.-diam
filler wire after five or six passes. It therefore still
appears feasible to produce quality welds on 6-in. sched
80 stainless pipe in 200 min.

Excellent results have also been obtained in tests of
welding pipes in the vertical position (see Fig. 5.9).
Accurate tracking around the pipe was obtained by
adding nylon thrust bearings to the rear of our 6-9 in.
carriage to transfer vertical loads to a split collar that
was clamped to the pipe. Root and filler passes of butt
joints with Y inserts in 6-in. heavy-wall 347 stainless
steel pipe were made with the same programmer input
selections that were used for horizontally positioned
pipe. The welds were of high quality. The bead shape
(Fig. 5.10) and the metallographic results adequately
met requirements. The vertical position is actually
better suited to automatic welding than the horizontal
position because the effects of gravity and capillary
action on the weld puddle remain constant around the
entire circumference of the pipe joint.

We utilized the borrowed 1-3 in. Air Force carriage
with our welding head for fusion welding of tubing
without addition of filler metal and for multipass
welding of pipe. Satisfactory results were obtained with
single-pass welds on thin-wall tubing provided that the
arc was kept stable throughout the welding. This was
best accomplished by lowering the arc voltage, using a
Y, ¢-in. electrode, and reducing the welding current to
almost half the normal value. Satisfactory multipass
welds were made on 2-in. sched 80 type 304L stainless
steel pipe by use of Y inserts. Welding parameters for
the tube and pipe welding were as follows:

We also used the borrowed 9-12 in. Air Force
carriage to investigate methods for welding 12-in. sched
10 (about ¥¢-in. wall) type 304 pipe that was

available. We had to program the welding current during’

the orbit of the carriage to compensate for the greatly
decreased heat capacity of the thin-walled pipe and to
adjust for the bending caused by the weight of the
carriage, which is approximately 50 Ib. Best results were
obtained without the use of consumable inserts. Addi-
tional development work is needed to overcome the
complicating factors of the thin wall.

Limited tests on 6-in. sched 40 carbon steel pipe were
conducted in order to investigate the influence of
metallurgical variables (melting point, thermal conduc-
tivity, viscosity, etc.) on welding parameters. So far, it
appears that power, speed, and other welding control
parameters are about the same as for stainless steels and
Hastelloy N.

In these exploratory tests on carbon steel, we welded
samples having four different joint designs. The best
was J-beveled with pipe ends butted together and
welded without insert rings. Filler wire was added to
the root pass because we found that burn-through
would occur on subsequent passes unless care was
exercised to first obtain a heavy root pass. Even then,
relatively thin beads had to be added over the first filler
pass before heavier beads could be used. The other
three joint designs were made with consumable inserts.
The root pass tended to burn through in some cases and
to lack full penetration in others.

We built a special combination pipe-bore-sizing and
tool-handling fixture for handling Y-shaped welding
inserts. The jib permits precise fitting of the ring and
improves the efficiency and quality of the weld-ring
tacking operation.

The weld programmer was checked to determine
whether any of the readouts had shifted during several
months of weld development testing. The curves that
were produced were identical to the initial calibration
data recorded over nine months earlier.

5.5.4 External Interest

Interest has been generated in our automated orbital
welding system for use in field erection of nuclear
reactors and other systems for containing radioactive
materials. We have been requested to submit proposals
for automated welding systems to the Tennessee Valley
Authority Browns Ferry site and to the Division of
Reactor Development and Technology, USAEC, for
possible use in the construction of the FFTF, SPTS
(Sodium Pump Test Facility), and/or the LOFT facility.

49

Use of the equipment for construction applications will
provide valuable information and experience under
actual field conditions. The extensive performance
testing and the resulting improvements of the machin-
ery and programming components that are common to
both the automatic-direct and the fully remote systems
will be of great benefit to the MSRP remote mainte-
nance program.

5.5.5 Design Studies

Looking beyond our prototype equipment, we have
begun to design larger-size orbiting carriages and to
consider ways of overcoming problems of high tempera-
ture and radiation. In the matter of size, it appears
questionable whether one can scale up the design of the
existing carriages beyond the 12-16 in. size. The
limiting factors to simple scaleup are the following: (1)
more torque is required to propel the heavier equip-
ment around the pipe and to provide the thrust force
for the cutting operation, (2) as the pipe diameter
increases, the effects of out-of-roundness, pipe wall
thickness variations, and surface irregularities become
increasingly important and require the use of a more

flexible system, (3) larger equipment of the existing
design would be expensive to fabricate. Design changes
to overcome these difficulties are indicated, concep-
tually, in Fig. 5.11. The pivoted roller assembly with
two rollers, instead of one, provides room for larger
motors, and more motors if necessary, plus more area
for frictional contact. The pivot arrangement also
decreases the effects of pipe surface irregularities on the
uniform travel of the carriage. The constant-torque
spring maintains a constant pressure between the roller
and the pipe regardless of any out-of-roundness
condition.

Use of the constant-torque spring and the pivoted
roller assembly is attractive for the MSR situation.
Here, the primary problems result from high tempera-
ture and gamma radiation. The two most vulnerable
items of the present carriage design are the Viton
rubber rollers and the drive motors. The Viton on the
drive rollers can be eliminated by use of a pair of split
geared tracks around the pipe to serve as a driving
surface for gears on the carriage, as shown in Fig. 5.12.
The body of the carriage fits between the two tracks,
allowing the idler roller to contact the pipe and thus
position the torch with respect to the work as is done in
present practice. Use of the constant-torque spring
permits the Viton to be eliminated from the idler roller.
The split track design also offers advantages for
operations such as internal pipe cleaning, weld prepara-
tion, and pipe aligning. Protection from gamma radia-
tion can be obtained by housing the dual drive assembly
in such a way as to provide shielding for the motor.

The welding module has been improved with the

addition of the self-adjusting vertical torch positioning

device. This reduces the stringent requirements that
formerly had to -be met in the carriage design to
compensate for pipe irregularities. The design criteria
will be further simplified if a new horizontal torch
positioning device now being designed performs satis-
factorily.

6. MSBR Instrumentation and Controls

W. H. Sides, Jr.

The report on the methods and results of the analog
simulation studies of the reference 1000-MW(e) MSBR
described earlier’ has been issued.? A report which will
document the analog computer program used in this
study is in preparation.

Further studies were conducted of the part-load
steady-state behavior of the reference MSBR plant. A
digital computer program similar to that reported in ref.
4 was written for a single-tube model of the steam
generator. The unit was divided into 500 axial regions
of equal heat flow. Variations in heat transfer coef-
ficients were taken into account, and steam-table data
and metal and salt property variations were included.
The inlet and outlet temperatures of the salts in the
primary heat exchanger were calculated using a “log
mean AT” approximation.

In the partload cases studied the heat load and
certain system flow rates and temperatures were
specified in various combinations as constants or
functions of load. The remaining system temperatures
and flows were calculated for loads between 20 and
100% of design load.

Five cases have been calculated. The primary salt flow
rate was held constant, and the feedwater temperature

‘was held constant at 700°F at all loads in all cases.

In case 1 the steam temperature was held constant at
1000°F, and the flow rate of the secondary salt was
held constant at all loads. The reactor inlet and outlet
temperatures, the secondary salt hot and cold leg

temperatures, and the flow rate and inlet pressure of
the steam were calculated as functions of load.

Case 2 was similar to case 1 except that the secondary
salt flow rate was specified as directly proportional to
the load. The results of this case are shown in Fig. 6.1.
Both these cases yielded an unacceptably low reactor
inlet temperature and/or secondary salt cold leg temper-
ature and indicated the need for a more effective means
to decouple the salt system from the steam system at
part load.

Case 3 included a variable bypass flow of secondary
salt around the primary heat exchanger. Again, the
steam temperature was held constant at 1000°F, and
the secondary salt flow rate through the steam genera-
tor was held constant. Also, the reactor inlet tempera-
ture was held constant at 1050°F at all loads. This
arrangement prevented the low salt temperatures. The
temperature difference between the secondary salt cold
leg and the feedwater increased, however, from 150°F
at design load to about 240°F at 20% load. Two further
cases were calculated to investigate a solution to this
problem.

In case 4 the steam temperature was allowed to rise
with decreasing load. The secondary salt flow rate was a
specific linearly decreasing function of load with no
bypass used. The reactor inlet temperature was again
held constant at 1050°F. The increasing steam tempera-
ture was subsequently attemperated to 1000°F before
reaching the turbine by the injection of feedwater. The
results yielded salt temperatures in an acceptable range.
The temperature difference between secondary salt cold
leg and the feedwater increased only to 190°F at 20%
load.

In case 5 the steam temperature was held constant at
1000°F at all loads. The secondary salt flow rate was
variable in the steam generator as well as in the primary
heat exchanger. A bypass of secondary salt around the
primary heat exchanger was included. The secondary
salt cold leg temperature was held constant at 850°F

 
 

 

 

52

and the reactor inlet temperature at 1050°F. The
required flow rates of secondary salt in the steam
generator and in the primary heat exchanger were

calculated. The results indicated that in order to -

maintain the cold leg temperature at 850°F, a slight
increase in secondary salt flow above the design point
value was required in the steam generator in the range
of 60 to 100% load. However, the penalty for not
allowing the flow rate to increase above its design value
but maintaining it constant in this range was a decrease
of only a few degrees in the secondary salt cold leg
temperature. These results are shown in Fig. 6.2. The
salt temperatures remained within the acceptable range,

and the temperature difference between the secondary
salt cold leg and the feedwater varied only a few degrees
over the 20 to 100% load.

The results of cases 4 and 5 yielded acceptable
temperature and flow profiles. The arrangement of case
4 required steam attemperation, and that of case 5
required a salt bypass valve and mixing chamber.

Further investigation is being carried on of the
part-load conditions for the MSBR. When one or more
systems for operating at part load are developed,
further dynamic analysis will be required to determine
overall system behavior.

7. Heat and Mass Transfer and Thermophysical Properties

H. W. Hoffman

7.1 HEAT TRANSFER
J. W. Cooke

Heat transfer experiments employing a proposed
MSBR fuel salt (LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF,, 67.5-20-12-0.5
mole %) flowing in a horizontal tube have indicated
that the local heat transfer coefficient varies somewhat
irregularly along the entire length of the tube in the
range 1000 < Ny, < 4000 for heat fluxes of the order
of 2 X 10° Btu hr! ft™2; it was suggested that a delay
in transition to turbulent flow could result in such a
variation for the transitional flow range. 2

To study the effect of flow development on heat
transfer, a new test section has been fabricated which is

_&

J. J. Keyes, Jr.

being installed in the inert-gas-pressurized molten-salt
heat transfer system shown schematically in Fig. 7.1.
This test section consists of a 48-in. length of
0.25-in.-0D X 0.035-in.-wall Hastelloy N tubing which
is centrally supported from a weigh cell by an electri-
cally insulated sliding cantilever beam. This weigh cell
will be used to ensure that a change in the supported
weight will not affect the calibration of the other two
weigh cells used to calculate the mass flow rate of salt.

Three electrodes are welded to the test section so that
either the left or right half, or the entire length, can be
resistance heated.

Since the flow alternates in direction, six different
modes of operation of the heat transfer system are
possible. Initially it is planned to heat only the left
section so that, with flow to the left, there will be a
24-in. hydrodynamic entrance length '(//d = 130) and
with flow to the right there will be no entrance length.
The 24-in. entrance length should be sufficient to
establish turbulent flow before the heat is applied. Thus
comparisons of heat transfer results for flow with and
without an entrance length should establish whether a
delay in the transition to turbulent flow does exist and,
if it does, to what extent the heat transfer coefficient is
affected.

In addition to the entrance effect studies, an investi-
gation of the effect of wetting on heat transfer is
planned. The fuel salt is normally nonwetting, but the
addition of certain metals (normally uranium) can cause
the salt to be reducing and to wet certain materials,
including Hastelloy N. The wetting characteristics of
the fuel salt with respect to Hastelloy N will be
monitored by an apparatus described in the following
section.

The influence of gas entrained by or evolved from the
molten salt on heat transfer is related to wetting of the
wall by the salt. Based on flow visualization studies
employing a 0.2-in.-diam tube with water flow and
helium bubble injection, it was concluded that bubble
coalescence would result in gas voids filling the cross
section of the small-diameter test section; it was
decided to defer gas entrainment experiments until a
pump loop is available which could accommodate a
larger test section. It is still planned to investigate the
effect of helium replacing argon as cover gas, on the
basis that more gas will be evolved due to the higher
solubility of helium.

7.2 THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES
J. W. Cooke

A new technique has been developed to determine the

54

angle of contact, 0, at the common intersection of the '

interfaces separating a solid, a liquid, and a gas (see Fig.
7.2). This technique consists in measuring the pressure
difference across the interface between a gas and a
liquid at various stages of the growth of a bubble which
is formed on the tip of a capillary tube immersed in the
liquid specimen.

In Fig. 7.3 are shown the various stages of bubble
growth for a given fluid which wets, partially wets, and

does not wet the capillary tube. For a constant volu-
metric flow rate of gas into the capillary tube, the
traces of pressure difference as a function of time are
shown on the right of the figure.

In the situation where the fluid wets the tube, the
pressure difference increases linearly as the interface
moves from position a to the end of the tube at
position b', where the interface is free to make a 90°
turn to position d’. In the process of moving from
positionb’ tod’, the radius of curvature of the interface
passes through a minimum (and the pressure difference
passes through a maximum value of hy) at position c. At
position d’, the interface cannot turn further because of
the contact angle, 8, and must move to the outside
radius of the capillary (position d), where (under stable
conditions) it is free to make another 90° turn to
position f'. The dashed portion of this curve and the
curve for partial wetting cannot be recorded unless the
total free gas volume (i.e., the bubble, the pressure
measuring device, and the connecting tubing) is very
small (<1 cm?).

In the situations where the fluid wets the tube only
partially, or not at all, the contact angle limits the
further growth of the bubble on the inside tube radius
(positions ¢") before the maximum pressure difference,
h;, can be obtained. The interface must then move to
the outside tube radius (positions d), where it is again
free to make another 90° turn to positions". In moving
from positions d to f’, the pressure differences will
again reach a maximum value of 4,,. Either &,, and r,, or
h; and r; can be directly related to the surface tension.

The pressure differences at the points on the pressure
trace where the pressure rise is no longer linear
(position b"), where the further growth of the bubble

. on the inside tube radius is limited by the contact angle

(positions ¢’ and d’), and where the growth on the
outside tube radius is limited by the contact angle
(positions f') can all be related to the contact angle.

Using the results obtained from a computer solution
for the interface separating two fluids, the contact angle
can be related to the dimensionless radius of attach-
ment, r/a, and the reduced pressure difference:

Bh,
h ’

 

1

where
r = radius of attachment, cm,

a® = specific cohesion, cm?,

55

h = maximum pressure difference, cm of fluid,

hg = pressure difference at points where the contact
angle can be determined (b', ¢’, d’, and"), cm of
fluid.

A plot of the reduced pressure difference as a
function of r/a for various ¢,, the angle between the
axis of revolution and the normal to the interface at the
radius of attachment (see Fig. 7.2), is given in Fig. 7.4.
The solid curves: describe the conditions before the
maximum pressure difference, k, is obtained (points b’
and ¢'), and the dashed curves describe the conditions
after the maximum pressure difference is obtained
(points d' and f"). To relate 6 to ¢,, the following
equations are used. For the contact angle with respect
to the inside tube surface (position b),

0=90°—9,; ©)

surface (positions ¢’ and d'),

6=180°—¢,; 3)

and, finally, for the contact angle with respect to the
outside tube surface (positions f'),

0 =270° —¢, . 4)

Experimental verifications of the technique have been
obtained using mercury and water at room temperature
(24.5°C). Unretouched recorder traces of the pressure
transducer output for the three types of wetting are
shown in Figs. 7.57.7. It is clear that each of these
recorder traces is nearly identical to those corre-
sponding in Fig. 7.3.

The pressure differences at the various positions
shown in Figs. 7.5—7.7 were used in conjunction with
the functions plotted in Fig. 7.4 and with Egs. (2), (3),
and (4) to obtain the results for the contact angle given
in Table 7.1. Concurrently, a standard sessile drop
technique (where direct optical measurements are made
of the profile of a drop resting on a horizontal surface)
was also used to obtain the contact angles for the same
systems. These results are also given in Table 7.1 and
are in excellent agreement with the results obtained by
the new technique. It is planned to use this technique
for monitoring the wetting characteristics of the
molten-salt—Hastelloy N system during the heat trans-
fer experiments discussed in Sect. 7.1.

developed to describe droplet sizes produced by spray
nozzles. If the percent of the total number of bubbles

Using the technique described above to establish the

Figure 7.10 is a cross plot of the data of Fig. 7.9
along with that of the other two mixtures for a bubble

decreased, the mass transfer coefficients appear to
approach a more or less constant value. The asymptotic
behavior at low values of the Reynolds modulus may be
deduced by assuming that the mass transfer coefficient
for a swarm of bubbles rising through a quiescent liquid
has the same functional dependence as that of a single
bubble. The latter is given by Calderbank,’

and, using the apparent asymptote of the 50% glycerol

Part 3. Chemistry /

W. R. Grimes

The chemical research and development activities
described below are conducted to establish the basic
chemical information required for the development of
advanced molten-salt reactor systems.

A substantial fraction of these efforts continued to be
devoted to the transport, distribution, and chemistry of
fission products in the MSRE. Investigations of fission
product behavior have been continued with specimens
removed from the MSRE fuel circuit, with “synthetic”
fuel mixtures, and by investigation of the chemistry of
molybdenum, niobium, and ruthenium in molten fluo-
ride mixtures.

A broad program of fundamental investigations into
the physical chemistry of molten=salt systems was
maintained; from it are derived the basic data for
reactor and chemical reprocessing design. Within the
scope of these efforts are included research in solution
thermodynamics and phase equilibria, crystal chem-
istry, electrochemistry, spectroscopy (both Raman and
electronic absorption), transport processes, and theo-
retical aspects of molten-salt chemistry.

Studies of the chemical aspects of separations
methods were continued. The results of these studies

form the basis for evolving modifications of methods
for reprocessing MSBR fuel salts. With recent adoption
of a fundamental change in the reference design for
MSBR fuel reprocessing, one which effects transfer of
rare earths from liquid bismuth to lithium chloride as
an acceptor solvent, emphasis in separation studies has
expanded to include the chemistry of molten chloride
systems.

The principal emphasis of analytical chemical de-
velopment programs has been placed on methods for
use in semiautomated operational control of molten-salt
breeder reactors, for example, the development of
in-line analytical methods for the analysis of MSR fuels,
for reprocessing streams, and for gas streams. These
methods include electrochemical and spectrophoto-
metric means for determination of the concentration of
U* and other ionic species in fuels and coolants and
adaptation of small on-line computers to electroana-
lytical methods. Parallel efforts have been devoted to
the development of analytical methods related to assay
and control of the concentration of water, oxides, and
tritium in fluoroborate coolants.

8.1 NOBLE METAL FISSION PRODUCT BEHAVIOR

It was noted in the previous report’ that noble metals
in MSRE salt samples acted as if they were particulate

constituents of a mobile “pool” of such substances held
up in the system for a substantial period and that
evidence regarding this might be obtained from the
activity ratio of pairs of isotopes.

Pairs of the same element, thereby having the same
chemical behavior (e.g., '°3Ru/'°®Ru), should be
particularly effective. As produced, the activity ratio of
such a pair is proportional to ratios of fission yields and
decay constants. Accumulation over the operating
history yields the inventory ratio, ultimately propor-

tional (at constant fission rate) only to the ratio of

fission yields. If however there is an intermediate
holdup and release before final deposition, the activity
ratio of the retained material will depend on holdup
time and will fall between production and inventory
values. Furthermore, the material deposited after such a
holdup will, as a result, have ratio values lower than
inventory. (Values for the isotope of shorter half-life,
here !°3Ru, will be used in the numerator of the ratio
throughout our discussion.) Consequently, comparison
of an observed ratio of activities (in the same sample)
with associated production and inventory ratios should
provide an indication of the “accumulation history” of
the region represented by the sample. Since both
determinations are for isotopes of the same element in
the same sample (consequently subjected to identical
treatment), many sampling and handling errors cancel
and do not affect the ratio. Ratio values are thereby
subject to less variation.

We are in process of using the '®2Ru/! °° Ru activity

ratio among others to examine samples of various kinds
taken at various times in the MSRE operation. These
include salt and gas samples from the pump bowl and
other materials briefly exposed there at various times.
Data are also available from the sets of surveillance
specimens removed after runs 11,2 14,> 18% and 20.5
Materials removed from the off-gas line after runs 14°
and 187 offer useful data. Some information is
available® from the on-site gamma spectrometer surveys
of the MSRE following runs 18 and 19, particularly
with regard to the heat exchanger and off-gas line.
Inventory and Model. — The data will be discussed in
terms of a “compartment” model, which will assign
first-order transfer rates common for both isotopes
between given regions and assume this behavior was
consistent throughout MSRE history. Because the

half-lives of !®3Ru and *®®Ru are quite different, 39.6
days and 367 days respectively, appreciably different
isotope activity ratios are indicated for different com-
partments and times as simulated operation proceeds. A
sketch of a useful scheme of compartments is shown in
Fig. 8.1.

We assume direct production of °3Ru and !?®Ru in
the fuel salt in proportion to fission rate and fuel
composition as determined by MSRE history.” The
material is fairly rapidly lost from salt either to
“surfaces” or to a mobile “particulate pool” of agglom-
erated material. The pool loses material to one or more
final repositories, nominally “off-gas,” and also may
deposit material on the “surfaces.” Rates are such as to
result in an appreciable holdup period of the order of
50 to 100 days in the “particulate pool.” Decay, of
course, occurs in all compartments.

Material is also transferred to the “drain tank” as
required by the history, and transport between com-
partments ceases in the interval.

From the atoms of each type at a given time in a
given compartment, the activity ratio can be calculated,
as well as an overall inventory ratio.

We shall identify samples taken from different regions
of the MSRE with the various compartments and thus
obtain insight into the transport paths and lags leading
to the sampled region. It should be noted that a
compartment can involve more than one region or kind
of sample. The additional information required to
establish the amounts of material to be assigned to a
given region, and thereby to produce a material balance,
is not available.

In comparison with the overall inventory value of
103Ru/'°®Ru, we should expect “surface” values to
equal it if the deposited material comes rapidly and
only from “salt,” and to be somewhat below it if in
addition “particulate” is deposited. If there is no direct
deposition from “salt” to “surface,” but only “par-
ticulate,” then deposited material should approach
“off-gas” compartment ratio.

The “off-gas” compartment ratio should be below
inventory, since it is assumed to be steadily deposited
from the “particulate pool,” which is richer in the
longlived '°®Ru component than production, and
inventory is the accumulation of production minus
decay.

The particulate pool will be above inventory if
material is transferred to it rapidly and lost from it at a
significant rate. Slow loss rates correspond to long
holdup periods, and ratio values tend toward inventory.

accumulation, and decay of '°3Ru and '°°Ru atoms

with respect to these compartments were incorporated
into a fourth-order Runge-Kutta numerical integration
scheme which was operated over the full MSRE power
history.

The rates used in one calculation referred to in the
discussion below show rapid loss (<1 day) from salt to
particulates and surface, with about 4% going directly
to surface. Holdup in the particulate pool results in a
daily transport of about 0.2% of the pool to “surface”
and about 2% per day of the pool to “off-gas,” for an
effective average holdup period of about 45 days. All
transport processes are assumed irreversible in this
scheme, =

Off-Gas Line Deposits, — Data have been reported on
the examination® after run 14 (March 1968) of the
jumper line installed after run 9 (December 1966), of

the examination” after run 18 (June 1969) of parts of a

specimen holder assembly from the main off-gas line
installed after run 14, and of the examination’ of parts
of line 523, the fuel pump overflow tank purge gas
outlet to the main off-gas line, which was installed
during original fabrication of MSRE. These data are
shown in Table 8.1.

For the jumper line removed after run 14, observed
ratios range from 2.4 to 7.3. By comparison the
inventory ratio for the net exposure interval was 12.1.
If a holdup period of about 45 days prior to deposition
in the off-gas line is assumed, we calculate a lower ratio
for the compartment of 7.0. It seems indicated that a
holdup of ruthenium of 45 days or more is required.

Ratio values from the specimen holder removed from
the 522 line after run 18 ranged between 9.7 and 5.0.
Net inventory ratio for the period was 19.7, and for
material deposited after a 45-day holdup we estimated a
ratio of 12.3. A longer holdup would reduce this
estimate. However, we recall that gas flow through this
line was appreciably diminished during the final month
of run 18. This would cause the observed ratio values to
be lower by an appreciable factor than would ensue
from steady gas flow all the time. A holdup period of
something over 45 days still appears indicated.

Flow of off-gas through line 523 was less well known.
In addition to bubbler gas to measure salt depth in the
overflow tank, part of the main off-gas flow from the
pump bowl went through the overflow tank when flow
through line 522 was hindered by deposits. The

observed ratio after run 18 was 8—13.7, inventory was
9.6, and for material deposited after 45 days holdup the
ratio is calculated to be 5.8. However, the unusually
great flow during the final month of run 18 (until

blockage of line 523 on May 25) would increase the

observed ratio considerably. This response is consistent
with the low value for material from line 522 cited
above. So we believe the assumption of an appreciable
holdup period prior to deposition in off-gas regions
remains valid.

Surveillance Specimens. — Surveillance specimens of
graphite and also selected segments of metal were
removed “from , the core surveillance assembly after
exposure throughout several runs. Table 8.2 shows
values of the activity ratios for '°3Ru/'°®Ru for a
number of graphite and metal specimens removed on
different occasions in 1967.2 19682 and 1969.4-°
Insofar as deposition of thesé isotopes occurred irre-

versibly and with reasonable directness soon after
fission, the ratio values should agree with the net
inventory for the period of exposure, and the samples
that had been exposed longest at a given removal time
should have appropriately lower values for the
103Ru/*®® Ru activity ratio.

Examination of Table 8.2 shows this latter view is
confirmed — the older samples do have values that are
lower, to about the right extent. However, we also note
that most observed ratio values fall somewhat below the
net inventory values. This could come about if in
addition to direct deposition from salt onto surfaces
deposition also occurred from the holdup “pool,”
presumed colloidal or particulate, which we mentioned
in discussing the off-gas deposits. Few of the observed
values fall below the parenthesized off-gas values. This
value was calculated to result if all the deposited
material had come from the holdup pool. Therefore, we
conclude that the surface deposits did not occur only
by deposition of material from the “particulate pool”;
calculated values are shown which assume rates which
would have about two-thirds coming from a particulate
pool of about 45-day holdup. The agreement is not
uncomfortable,

In general the metal segments showed lower values
than graphite specimens similarly exposed, with some
observed values below any corresponding calculated
values. This implies that in some way in the later part of
its exposure the tendency of the metal surface to
receive and retain ruthenium isotope deposits became
diminished, particularly in comparison with the
graphite specimens. Also the metal may have retained
more particulate and less directly deposited material
than the graphite, but on balance the deposits on both
types of specimen appear to have occurred by a
combination of the two modes.

Pump Bowl Samples. — Ratio data are available on
salt samples and later gas samples removed from the
pump bowl spray shield beginning with run 7 in 1966.
Similar data are also available for other materials
exposed from time to time to the gas or liquid regions
within the spray shield. Data from outer sheaths of
double-wall capsules are included. Data for the activity
ratios (dis min! '®3Ru/dis min" !°¢Ru) are shown
for most of these in Fig. 8.2. In this figure the activity
ratios are plotted in sample sequence. Also shown on
the plot are values of the overall inventory ratio, which
was calculated from power history, and the production
ratio, which was calculated from yields based on fuel
composition. This changed appreciably during runs
4-14, where the plutonium content increased because
of the relatively high 232U content of the fuel. The

106 Ru yield from 23°Pu is more than tenfold greater
than its yield from 233U or 23%U. The plutonium
content of the fuel did not vary nearly as much during
the 233 U operation and was taken as constant.

Also shown are lines which have been computed
assuming a particulate pool with average retention
periods of 45 and 100 days. The point has been made
previously! that noble metal activity associated with
any materials exposed in or sampled from the pump
bowl is principally from this mobile pool rather than
being dissolved in: salt or occurring as gaseous sub-
stances. Consequently, similar ratios should be en-
countered for salt and gas samples and surfaces of
various materials exposed in the pump bowl.

Examination of Fig. 8.2 indicates that the prepon-
derance of points fall between the inventory line and a
line for 45-day average retention, agreeing reasonably
well with an average holdup of between 45 and 100
days — but with release to off-gas, surfaces, and other
regions resulting in a limited retention rather than the
unlimited retention implied by an inventory value.

Although meaningful differences doubtless exist be-
tween different kinds of samples taken from the pump
bowl, their similarity clearly indicates that all are taken
from the same mobile pool, which loses material, but
slowly enough to have an average retention period of
several months.

Discussion. — The data presented above represent
practically all the ratio data available for MSRE
samples. The data based on gamma spectrometer
surveys® of various reactor regions particularly after
runs 18 and 19 have not been examined in detail but in
cursory views appear not too inconsistent with values
given here.

It appears possible to summarize our findings about
fission product ruthenium in this way:

The off-gas deposits appear to have resulted from the
fairly steady accumulation of material which had been
retained elsewhere for periods of the order of several
months prior to deposition.

The deposits on surfaces also appear to have con-
tained material retained elsewhere prior to deposition,
though not to quite the same extent, so that an
appreciable part could have been deposited soon after
fission.

All materials taken from the pump bowl contain
ruthenium isotopes with a common attribute — they are
representative of an accumulation of several months.
Thus all samples from the pump bowl presumably get

- their ruthenium from a common source.

Since it is reasonable to expect fission products to
enter salt first, as ions or atoms, presumably these
rapidly deposit on surfaces or are agglomerated. The
agglomerated material is not dissolved in salt but is

fairly well dispersed and may deposit on surfaces to
some extent. It is believed that regions associated with
the pump bowl — the liquid surface, including bubbles,
the shed roof, mist shield, and overflow tank — are
effective in accumulating this agglomerated material.
Regions with highest salt surface/salt mass (gas samples
containing mist and surfaces exposed to the gas-liquid
interface) have been found to have the highest quan-
tities of these isotopes relative to the amount of salt in
the sample. So the agglomerate seeks the surfaces. Since
the subsurface salt samples, however, never show
amounts of ruthenium in excess of inventory,! it would
appear that material entrained, possibly with bubbles, is
fairly well dispersed when in salt.

Loss of the agglomerated material to one or more
permanent sinks at a rate of 1 or 2% per day is
indicated. In addition to the off-gas system and to some
extent the reactor surfaces, these sinks could include
the overflow tank and various nooks, crannies, and
crevices if they provided for a reasonably steady
irreversible loss.

The ratio method without additional information
cannot indicate how much material follows a particular
path to a particular sink, but it does serve to indicate
the paths and the transport lags along them for the
isotopes under consideration.

8.2 SHORT-TERM FISSION PRODUCT
DEPOSITION TESTS

S.S.Kimslis  F. F. Blankenship
L. L, Fairchild

A considerable amount of data pertaining to fission
product deposition on graphite and Hastelloy N during
long-term exposures to fissioning fuel salt in the MSRE
core has been collected. It is of practical interest to
know whether reactor surfaces become “saturated”
with deposited fission products leading to decreasing
deposition rates with continued reactor operation. The
data from long-term tests are generally consistent with
deposition rates for all fission products not changing
with time. after long operation. This conclusion would
be strengthened if short-term tests showed early deposi-
tion rates rapidly leveling off to match the long-term
rates. The results of early attempts to measure short-
term deposition rates in the MSRE pump bowl were
uninterpretable because of neavy deposition of fission
products on the specimens from the gas phase above the
fuel salt level, while the specimens were being lowered
down to and raised up from the fuel. Therefore, a
“window” capsule was designed in which the specimens
were protected from the gas phase before and after

66

immersion in the fuel. Three small graphite rods and
three Hastelloy N strips were attached by wires below a
hollow metal bulb (Fig. 8.3) which could move ver-
tically inside a nickel capsule with windows cut in its
sides. The walls of the cylindrical bulb sealed the
windows except when the capsule was immersed in the
fuel salt; immersion caused the buoyant hollow bulb to

float upward, “opening the windows” and exposing the
specimens to fuel salt. Four capsules of this type were
immersed in the pump bowl fuel salt for exposures of
10,3,1,and % hr.

The small quantities of ®*Zr, *4!Ce, '*4Ce, '*"Nd,
and '*°Ba found on all specimens, corresponding to
0.02 mg or less of fuel salt per square centimeter of
sample, could be reasonably accounted for as simple
contamination by the fuel salt. This explanation is
consistent with the further observation that there was
no significant variation of deposition with exposure
time for these species. The higher depositions of these
species on core-exposed specimens (1 to 4 mg of salt
per square centimeter) was probably due to the
operation of fission recoil, a mechanism absent in the
pump bowl.

The behavior of 8?Sr, shown in Table 8.3, was at first
surprising: the deposition on all specimens for all
exposure times was approximately the same — equiv-
alent to about 0.1 mg of fuel salt per square centimeter
of surface. By comparison, 8°Sr deposition on core-
exposed metal specimens corresponded to about 3 mg
of fuel salt per square centimeter, while on graphite

67

specimens it was equivalent to 3000 mg of salt per

square centimeter or 4000 mg of fuel salt per gram of
graphite.

These facts can be rationalized if the ®°Kr concen-
tration in the pump bowl salt were low as compared
with that in the core salt. This must be so, since the
core salt is relieved of the bulk of its gas content by
being sprayed into the pump bowl. Thus one would not
expect that much ®°Kr enters the graphite while it is

fuel salt containing the concentration of 32Sr it would contain

On the other hand, while the metal and graphite
specimens are in the gas phase, before and after
immersion, they are equally exposed to a rain of ®°Sr
from decaying krypton in the gas phase. If both
surfaces are good sinks for elemental Sr, the equal
deposition on both surfaces is explained. The exposures
to the gas phase were for similar lengths of time for all
these runs. The window capsule can protect the samples
against a particulate dust or spray but not against truly
gaseous species like 3°Kr.

The deposition of the noble metal nuclides (°°Mo,
95Nb, 11 Ag, 1297, 1 327e, 103pu, and 106 Ry) and
1311 on both graphite and Hastelloy N showed a
definite but not very large variation with time of
exposure. The 10- and 3-hr exposures showed about
five times as much deposition of these nuclides as the
1-hr and 10-min exposures. However, the data from the
10- and 3-hr exposures were very similar, as was the
case for the 1-hr and 10-min exposures. These data are
best compared with each other and with the long-term
surveillance data in terms of the rate equation:

where

N = atoms deposited per square centimeter,

A = decay rate, sec” , and

t = deposition time, sec.

Table 8.4 gives a comparison of deposition rates (k’s)
calculated from the 10-hr exposure data and from the
fifth set of surveillance specimens. Reasons for the low
10-hr deposition rates of °*Mo, '32Te, and '3'I on
Hastelloy N are not known. However, a surprising
number of the ratios of these rates are near 1, indicating
nearly equal deposition rates in the pump bowl after 10
hr and in the core after about 2000 hr. Thus it appears
that the reactor surfaces would not become saturated
with noble metal fission products and would therefore
continuously absorb them. It also appears that the
original fast 10-min rates of deposition are reduced
within about 10 hr to more moderate rates which then
remain constant.

The high 10-hr deposition rate of !3'I on graphite
resulting in the unusually high ratio of 24.8 in Table 8.4
is also difficult to explain. The deposition rate of '*'I
on graphite for the 3-hr exposure in the pump bowl was
even higher. In both short-term tests the deposition of
1311 was usually only slightly less than that of !3*Te
and usually higher than that of '2°Te, measured in
grams of theoretical salt per sample. In long-term core
exposures, the deposition of tellurium usually exceeded
‘that of '*'lI by an order of magnitude or more
measured in the same units. This suggests that the
25-min '3!Te originally deposited heavily, then de-
cayed to '3'I, which was slowly washed off by the fuel
salt.

8.3 FISSION PRODUCT DEPOSITION ON THE
FIFTH SET OF GRAPHITE AND HASTELLOY N
SAMPLES FROM THE MSRE CORE

S.S.Kirstis  F. F. Blankenship
L. L. Fairchild

A fifth set of long-term surveillance specimens of
graphite (Poco grade AXF-5Q) and Hastelloy N was
exposed to fissioning molten fuel salt for 12,943 MWhr
during the final runs 19 and 20 of the MSRE. These
tubular specimens were especially designed’ to test the
effects of surface roughness and different flow con-
ditions on the deposition of fission products from the’
fuel salt on or into the solids. One of the specimen
assemblies contained electron microscope screens for
_ detecting particulate matter in the gas phase above
stagnant molten fissioning fuel salt.

Specimen Array for MSRE Runs 19 and 20, ORNL-TM-2743
(Dec. 22, 1969). .

8.3.1 Effect of Surface Roughness

There was no variation of deposition of any fission
product with surface roughness for either graphite or
Hastelloy N. For graphite the adjacent samples were
machined to surface roughnesses of 5, 25, and 125 pin.
rms. Most of the metal samples were machined to the
same range of roughnesses, but they also included
1, 6-in.-diam Hastelloy N wire samples with surfaces as
drawn and one tube with surface as machined (of
undetermined roughness).

Two different explanations are invoked for the lack
of dependence of deposition on surface roughness,
which clearly eliminates a simple adsorption theory.
For the deposition of °5Zr, '*!Ce, and '**Ce on
graphite and of ®°Sr, **Zr, *27Cs, '4°Ba, '*! Ce, and
144Ce on Hastelloy N, the quantity deposited
amounted only to the equivalent of contamination by 1
to 4 mg of fuel salt per square centimeter of surface.
Fission recoil is thought to be the mechanism by which
these species are injected into the graphite and metal
surfaces. The much heavier (by two or three orders of
magnitude) depositions of noble metal fission products
(*°Mo, °5Nb, '°3Ru, '?°Te, '32Te) on metal and
graphite are thought to be controlled by mass transfer
through a stagnant film of salt adjacent to the surface.
However, large differences in diffusion coefficients,
particle size, or accommodation coefficients for the
different elements must be invoked to make the simple
mass transfer model fit the data.

A similar model for the mass transfer of the rare-gas
precursors of 2°Sr and '*®Ba through a salt film is
thought to account for the observed heavy deposition
of these species in graphite. In the case of '*7Cs a
mobility of cesium in the graphite must be also pos-
tulated to account for the low concentration remaining
in the graphite.

8.3.2 Effect of Flow Conditions on Deposition

- The several tubular test specimens of graphite and
Hastelloy N in the fifth set of surveillance specimens
were intentionally arranged to provide some variety of
flow conditions under which the fuel contacted the
graphite and metal surfaces. The low pressure drops
available made it impossible to extend the flow con-
ditions into the turbulent range. The flow conditions
varied only from stagnant fuel salt to linear velocities of
about 1 fps, or Reynolds numbers of about 700.
Turbulence promoter wires were wrapped around one
graphite and one metal tube, although sizable effects on
turbulence were not expected at these low velocities.

uv

ne
 

On the Hastelloy N specimens, deposition of fission
products varied significantly from the average only for
the tube containing stagnant fuel salt with a 1%-in.-
long gas-phase region above the salt. Deposition on
Hastelloy N from stagnant salt was about the same as
from flowing fuel for %°Sr, °3Zr, '37Cs, '*°Ba,
141Ce, and '**Ce. As expected, heavy deposition of
89Sr and fivefold greater deposition of '*®Ba than
from salt took place from the gas phase on Hastelloy N.
For °°Mo, deposition from stagnant fuel was even
heavier than the heavy deposition from flowing fuel.
There was equally heavy deposition of *°Mo on the
metal surfaces contacting the gas phase. But the
deposition from stagnant salt of °>3Nb, !°3Ru, !32Te,
and '2'1 was lower by a factor of 10 than from flowing
salt. The quantities of ®SNb, '®2Ru, '°®Ru, and '3'1
on gas-exposed Hastelloy N were another factor of 10
lower. The amounts of '32Te on Hastelloy N exposed
to stagnant salt and to the gas phase were similar. The
different behaviors of ?Mo, !32Te, and the remaining
noble metal fission products are difficult to explain.

There was no graphite specimen exposed to stagnant
fuel; thus no significant variations of deposition on the
graphite specimens were observed.

It was rather disappointing that the above results did
not confirm the film-controlled diffusion model more
definitely. The decreased deposition of *SNb, '®?Ru,
106Ru, '32Te, and '3'I from the stagnant fuel is in
accord with the model. The behavior of *?Mo in the
stagnant region is anomalous.

8.3.3 Comparison of Deposition of Noble Metal
Fission Products on Graphite and Hastelloy N

One of the assemblies in the fifth set of surveillance
specimens was designed expressly’ to compare fission
product deposition on metal and graphite surfaces
exposed to fissioning fuel under identical conditions.
The fuel was made to flow in a Y¢-in.-wide annulus
between a Hastelloy N core % in. in diameter and a
%s-in.-ID Poco graphite tube.

The deposition of noble metal fission products on
these graphite and metal surfaces is compared in Table
8.5. The unit of activity used in the table is grams of
‘theoretical salt per square centimeter of surface. The
theoretical salt contains all of each nuclide which would
be found in the fuel salt if decay were the only loss
mechanism. This unit of comparison takes into account
the power history of the fuel. Each value can be
multiplied by the total area of graphite (~2 X 10° cm?)
or metal (~1 X 10° cm?) and divided by the total
grams of fuel (~5 X 10°) in the reactor to yield the

fraction of total nuclide present to be found on the
graphite or metal.

The last two columns of the table give the average
depositions on the 12 graphite and the 13 metal
surveillance specimens exposed to flowing fuel salt
during the same period.

These results show that the deposition behavior on
adjacent specimens is generally similar to that on
geometrically separated samples and confirm the previ-
ously noted preference of most noble metal nuclides to
deposit on metal rather than on graphite. This would
argue for different accommodation coefficients for
deposition on metal and graphite. In previous tests
more °Nb usually deposited on graphite than on
metal.

8.3.4 Concentration Profiles of Fission Products
in Graphite

The interior surfaces of the two graphite tubes from

the fifth set of surveillance specimens (see ref. 9) were

sampled in a hot cell with a special adjustable boring
tool making successive cuts 1, 2, 3, 10, and 10 and 20
mils thick. The graphite powder samples were dissolved
and analyzed radiochemically for 3°Sr, *5Zr, '4°Ba,
1370 1 41 Ce, ! 44, 99 Mo, 1297 1 32g 131 1,
95Nb, '°2Ru, and !°°Ru. A sample of each graphite
piece which remained after boring was analyzed to
provide information on fission product deposition on
the exterior surfaces of the graphite tubes.

The concentration profiles and total depositions per
square centimeter obtained were generally similar to
those from previous sets of surveillance specimens. As
usual, except for 3°Sr, !37Cs, and '#°Ba the concen-
trations of fission products fell by two or more orders
of magnitude in a few mils. For the three exceptions,
each possessing a rare-gas precursor of appreciable
half-life, the interior profiles were level, as previously
observed for Poco graphite. The interior level averaged

 
 

 

 

3.7 X 10"! dis min™' g™* for ®°Sr, about twice the
average for Poco graphite in the fourth set of surveil
lance specimens and four times the average for Poco
graphite in the third set. The interior concentrations for
149Ba (and most other isotopes) were similar in the
three sets of specimens.

The 2° Sr profiles were unusual also in that all five of
them showed higher interior than surface concen-
trations. The first surface sample, about 1 mil thick,
usually contained a concentration of about 2 X 10'!
dis min™ g™ of 8%Sr, which rose to about 4 X 10!
dis min" g™' at a depth of 5 mils. Hints of similar
behavior were noted for *4°Ba and '37Cs. A reexami-
nation of profiles for Sr, !*°Ba, and !37Cs from
previous surveillance specimens also frequently showed
low concentrations in the first few mils from the
salt-exposed surface. Typically, the concentrations
would fall from a high initial value at the surface to a
low value at a depth of 3 to 5 mils, then rise to a level
intermediate value.

This mobility was anticipated for '37Cs, which is
known to exhibit a volatility as the element or carbide.
Some information on a high mobility of ®?Sr and
140B, diffusing through pyrolytic carbon coatings on
UO, and UC, fuel particles is in accord with the
observed profiles. Since the fuel salt or flush salt should
be an effective sink for elemental ®°Sr, '*°Ba, and
137Cs, their diffusion from the interior of the graphite
toward the salt could conceivably result in the observed
concentration gradients, particularly during low- or
Zero-power operation.

8.3.5 Electron Microscope Examination of Particles
in the Gas Phase Above Fuel Salt in the MSRE

The topmost test assembly in the fifth set of
surveillance specimens was a Hastelloy N tube closed at
the top end, open to flowing salt at the bottom end,
and containing a central rod with 11 electron micro-
scope screens attached every ', in. vertically. Post-
irradiation examination of the rod and screens showed
that during MSRE power operation the salt level in the
tube rose so that only the top two screens were in the
helium gas phase at the top of the tube. The long
heating of the screens caused them to self-weld to the
rod, so that it was not possible to remove the copper

70

screens from the Hastelloy N rod without damaging the

delicate carbon film on the screens.

With the electron microscope it was possible to see
irregularly shaped particles with a sintered appearance
on a few remaining scraps of carbon film. The particles
were about 0.1 to 10 u in size, occasionally strung

together in chains, and gave electron diffraction
patterns suggestive of Li, BeF, crystals. No other kinds
of particles could be identified on the screens from the
gas phase above the molten fissioning salt. Radio-
chemical analyses had shown that deposits on the
gas-phase tube walls contained 6 to 9 X 10'*® atoms of
°9Mo per square centimeter (several monolayers) at
reactor shutdown. Apparently this material did not
collect into particles big enough to see with the electron
microscope.

8.4 A POSSIBLE ORIGIN OF SMOKES AND MISTS
EMITTED BY MSRE FUEL

F. F. Blankenship

The fact that fluoride fuels are strongly nonwetting
toward clean metals is well established. The conse-
quences of such interfacial behavior for very small
metallic particles or even single atoms are perhaps
novel, if not surprising.

In the first place, a particle which is at the melt
surface is on the surface rather than in the surface as in
more familiar cases. This is because the interfacial
energies are less the smaller the area of liquid-solid
contact. A particle at the surface is expelled from the
surface, and work would be required to cause the
particle to penetrate the surface again.

As diagrammed simply in Fig. 8.4, once out of the
liquid the particle tends to remain out. Figure 8.4

shows the interfacial energy levels, E, over a distance .

interval (d) that includes a liquid-gas interface.

Either Side of a Liquid-Gas Interface.

The question arises whether, as a particle moves from
a higher potential energy in the liquid to a lower energy
state outside, part of the potential energy difference is
converted to kinetic energy.

Looking at the reverse process we can calculate the
minimum kinetic energy a metal particle must possess
to penetrate the surface as it collides with the liquid
interface. A new liquid-metal interface having the area
of the particle is created. The assumption is made that
the increase in interfacial energy is at least as great as
for this much newly created liquid area. The surface
energy of the liquid is numerically equal to the surface
tension, and in the case of MSRE fuel is about 200
ergs/cm?. The surface tension increases as temperature
decreases.

Considering a single atom of molybdenum (diameter
2.80 A), the surface area is 2.46 X 107! cm? and the
energy increment is 4.92 X 107"? erg. Thus the
minimum velocity required is 8 X 10* cm/sec. For
comparison, the most probable velocity for gas mol-
ecules is /2RT/M, which for molybdenum at 900°K is
4X 10% cm/sec.

The notion of using for the surface energy of a single
atom the same value as for an ordinary interface seems
somewhat unrealistic. However, this procedure gives the
correct answers in calculating the solubility of rare gases
in liquids and in nucleation theory.

If, when the liquid surface collapses as the particle is
ejected, droplets are also jetted, as when a gas bubble
collapses, we have an explanation of both the smoke
and the mist that seem to arise from the fuel.

Another peculiar consequence of the nonwetting
interface is that a single atom is already a critical
nucleus. In other words, there is no surface energy
barrier to the growth of any size clump. Thus the only
hindrance to homogeneous or bulk nucleation of metals
in the melt is the great dilution. We suspect that not
much nucleation occurs there or else the metals would
form alloys and travel together. Usually for homo-
geneous nucleation about 200 atoms are required to
form a critical nucleus. :

According to the hypothesis presented here, the
differences noted in the behavior of various metal
fission product atoms are to be attributed to differences
in wettability which alter the value of 200 ergs/cm>
used in Fig. 8.4.

This proposed mechanism is compatible ‘with the
observed behavior of smokes arising from quiescent
fuels where there are no bubbles. It explains why the
phenomena can be demonstrated at the tracer level with
95 Zr-2$Nb, again without bubbles. It also explains why
we were unable to prepare stable metallic colloids in the

71

fuel. It allows the diffusion in the liquid to be the
rate-controlling step and does not depend on the nature
of the surface in contact with the liquid.

At first glance the particle rejection by the fuel, as
proposed here, is at variance with the fact that during
the later operation of the MSRE the noble metals were
sometimes found in the fuel and sometimes not, in an
erratic fashion. The explanation may lie in the fact that
fuel analyses detected sludges that were rafted around
and were sometimes sampled and sometimes not. The
sludge was probably not in the liquid in the sense that a
wetted or soluble particle might be. Also, the sludge
was alloyed, in that the proportions of the metals were
not erratic.

Another prediction that can be made with confidence
is that a nonwetted particle on the surface of a liquid
could, if small enough, be dislodged by the molecular
movements causing Brownian motion.

8.5 SYNTHESIS OF NIOBIUM FLUORIDES
C.F. Weaver J1.S.Gill

Small (1-g) samples of niobium tetrafluoride were
synthesized by the reduction of excess NbFs with
niobium metal in quartz containers at 200°C.'® The
product was identified by x-ray diffraction anal-
ysis.! 21! It is currently being used in studies of the
disproportionation reactions of the lower fluorides of
niobium. A portion of the tetrafluoride was supplied to
J. B. Bates and G. E. Boyd for use in Raman spectra
studies.

Prolonged heating of NbF, at 250°C under vacuum in
a quartz tube produced NbFs and a material different
than Nb, NbF,, and NbFs which by mass spectrometric
analysis contained few impurities, suggesting that this
was a niobium fluoride with valence less than 4.

These studies will be continued in order to determine
the conditions under which the niobium fluorides are
stable and under which the disproportionations may be
used to synthesize the lower fluorides.

of 7 X 10~3 ppm—1/2 hr—1. This behavior was not
affected by the helium flow rate, surface area of the
copper container, presence of UF,, presence of
graphite, or the quantity of molybdenum metal pro-
duced. In no case has the copper container been
oxidized by the molybdenum solutions. These observa-
tions lead to the conclusion that trivalent molybdenum
in molten Li,BeF,; at 500°C was removed from the
system by a homogeneous disproportionation reaction.

The behavior of similar solutions at higher tempera-
tures is not as well understood at present. The few
experiments which we have conducted at 700°C
suggest! 25 that the loss of molybdenum occurred
more rapidly than at 500°C, the order of removal was
variable and higher than at S00°C, and the removal rate
was flow dependent. A recent experiment was started at
500°C and finished at 600°C as shown in Fig. 8.7. It
displayed a much more rapid loss of molybdenum than
a similar experiment which differed only in that the
surface area of the copper container was less by an
order of magnitude. These experiments suggest that the
mechanism of removal of Mo" from molten Li, BeF, is
different in the 600 to 700°C temperature range than
near 500°C. Such observations are consistent with the
previously reported mass spectrometric results! >! 61°
that near 500° only MoFs and MoF; are found in the
vapor above disproportionating MoF3. Above 500°C
MoF, occurs and becomes an increasingly important
species as the temperature rises.

Fig. 8.7. Removal of Mo® from Molten Li, BeF.

Evidence that niobium metal was oxidized in the
MSRE when the U*/U* ratios were low led to the
suggestion that its behavior might provide a means of
monitoring the redox potential of such a system. In this
connection the reactions

Nb + xHF(g) = (x/2)H,(g) + NbF_(d)
and
NbF,(d) + Li > Nb + xLiF

in molten Li, BeF, are being investigated.' 7! ®

The solutions produced by hydrofluorination of
niobjum metal at 500°C in molten Li, BeF,; have been
found to be stable for periods as long as a month with
no evidence of a drop in concentration'® and have
shown strong resistance to reduction with H, gas.
Consequently a stronger reductant, lithium metal, was
used to reduce the Nb** and to determine its valence.
Over the concentration range 340 to 2990 ppm Nb**
the valence was determined to be 3.8 + 0.3. We
detected no obvious trend in the value with concen-
tration. The fractional value may be caused by a
mixture of species, a cluster compound, or simply
experimental error in the determination. The value of
Py p/P? was near 10™ atm!/? and varied by about
20% over the concentration range 1000 to 1600 ppm of
Nb** consistent with the high valence mentioned

73

above. This behavior with respect to reduction by
hydrogen indicates that niobium is only slightly more
noble than chromium and considerably more reactive
than iron. These observations should not be extrapo-
lated to other temperatures, since there is evidence in
the literature? that both the valence and the stability
of the niobium fluorides are strongly temperature
dependent.

8.7 MASS SPECTROSCOPY OF NIOBIUM
FLUORIDES

C.F.Weaver J.D. Redman

Earlier work'®:!7:2! on the mass spectroscopy of

niobium fluorides consisted in observing the penta-
fluoride, the associated oxyfluoride impurities, and the
fluorination of niobium metal. More recently the
disproportionation of the lower fluorides was given
attention. We have previously reported that both a
dimer and trimer of NbFs have been observed.2! The
ionization efficiency curves and appearance potentials
for the fragments of these species were given.'¢:' 7-2!
The cracking pattern for NbOF; was tabulated as well
as that for the complex polymer mixture of pentavalent
niobium fluorides. We have recently attempted to
resolve this composite pattern into the cracking
patterns for the individual pentavalent species. Tenta-
tive cracking patterns based on the assumption that the
vapor over NbF; crystals at 75°C is essentially all

These studies have also shown that at the higher
temperatures both fluorination of niobium metal as
well as the disproportion of NbF, produce, in addition
to NbF;s, at least one lower fluoride of niobium,
probably NbF;, in the vapor phase.

Analysis of the NbF, disproportionation experi-
ments, which are still in progress, suggests that NbF,
disproportionates above 100°C. This is consistent with
the disproportionation of NbF, in quartz at 250° noted
above (Sect. 10.3). That these temperatures are some-
what lower than those in the literature?® is most likely
a reflection of low operating pressure and high sensi-
tivity of the mass spectrometer. In the temperature
range 100—300°C the vapor over disproportionating
NbF,, was nearly all NbFs. Above 300°C the vapor
contained, in addition to NbFs, a lower niobium
fluoride, probably NbF;. A typical vapor composition
in the temperature range 320 to 550°C was 89% NbF;,
1% Nb,F,4, and 10% NbF;. The low-temperature
instability of pure NbF, contrasts sharply with the
stability of the NbF; 3 solutions in molten Li, BeF, at
500°C described in Sect. 10.4. The temperature de-
pendence of the equilibrium shown in Fig. 8.8 yields a
AH° of 7 kcal per mole of Nb,F;o in the same
temperature range.

Use of the cracking patterns tabulated above to
analyze the results of niobium fluorination indicates
that the reaction Nb + F, yields essentially pure NbF;
with a few percent Nb,F;, between 150 and 600°C.
At temperatures between 650 and 900°C the trifluoride
also appeared to be present. A typical yield was 83%
NbF; , 1 1% Nb, F, 0> and 6% NbF, .

8.8 RAMAN SPECTRA OF CRYSTALLINE
MoF; AND MoF,

John B. Bates George E. Boyd

The infrared and Raman spectra of liquid and
polycrystalline MoF; have been reported by Quellette
et al.2? The vibrational spectrum of molten MoFs was
interpreted on the basis of Dj, molecular symmetry
(trigonal bipyramid), but no attempt was made to
assign the infrared or Raman spectrum of the poly-
crystalline material. The Raman spectrum of crystalline
MoF, has not, to the best of our knowledge, been
previously reported.

We have remeasured the room-temperature Raman
spectrum of crystalline MoFs under conditions of
higher resolution than were employed previously.??
The spectrum, shown in Fig. 8.9, was recorded with a
Jarrell-Ash model 25-300 spectrophotometer using the
4880-A line of a Spectra Physics 141 argon ion laser as
the exciting source. The spectral slit width (resolution)
was set at between 1 and 2 cm™ on different scans.
Samples of MoF; which had been sublimed onto the
upper walls of a quartz reaction flask were employed.
Spectra of MoF, (Fig. 8.10) were obtained from a
yellowish-tan solid contained in the bottom of the
reaction flask using the 6328-A line of a helium-neon
laser. Both MoF; and MoF, were obtained in one stage
of a process leading to the synthesis of MoF3.23 By

exciting the Raman spectra of these materials when
they were contained in the evacuated reaction flask, it
was not necessary to interrupt the synthesis of MoF; at
this stage.

Raman spectra of crystalline NbFs and TaF;, which
have the same crystal structure as MoFs,2* were
recently reported by Beattie and coworkers.?® The
observed bands were assigned from a normal coordinate
analysis of the NbyF;4 and Ta FF, tetrameric struc-
tures which are contained in the primitive unit cell of
the respective crystal lattices.2%:27 Of particular im-
portance to the subject of this report, it was assumed in
ref. 25 that coupling between the four corners of the
tetramers across the fluoride bridges was small.

From the structure determination of Edwards et
al.,’* MoF; crystallizes in the monoclinic system, and
the lattice belongs to the C3; (C,/m) space group.
There are 24 atoms in the primitive cell in which the
four molybdenum atoms are joined through fluoride
bridges to form a square tetrameric unit, as shown in
Fig. 8.11. Two of the molybdenum atoms located at
opposite corners of the tetramer occupy C, sites, while
the remaining (opposite) pair of molybdenum atoms

standard procedures, the irreducible representation for
the 69 optical (k = 0) modes of crystalline MoF; is
given by

TOP(C,,) = 194+ 178, +154, +188, .

Thus, based on C,j, selection rules, 36 k = 0 modes of
crystalline MoFs are Raman active and the remaining
33 optical modes are infrared active. The observed
spectrum of crystalline MoFs (Fig. 8.9 and ref. 22),
however, appears to be much less complex than
expected from the above selection rules. A comparison
of the Raman spectrum of crystalline MoFs (Fig. 8.9)

with that of the molten material suggested to us an
interpretation of the crystal spectrum based on a
double-correlation scheme.

The correlation diagrams which map the symmetry

species of the Dy (molecular) group of MoFs onto the
species of the C,, factor group through the C, and C
site groups are presented in Table 8.6. The 0, orien-
tation of the C; group with respect to the D3; group
was chosen (Table 8.6) after consideration of the
arrangement of fluorine atoms about the “C” corners
of the Mo, F,, tetramer. The correct orientation is not
clear in this case, but this is a minor point in the
following discussion and in view of the presently
available spectral data. The 12 MoFs fundamental
modes assuming Dj; symmetry are described by 2 Ay +
2 A3 + 3 E +E". In the limit of zero (or very weak)
coupling between adjacent comers of the Mo,F,,
tetramer, the origin of the MoFs ¥ = 0 crystal
vibrations can be determined from Table 10.6. For
example, the v; (4) molecular mode gives rise to two
A, components in the crystal, AZ and AL, where 2 and
b denote that the factor group states arise, respectively,
from a C; and a C, site state. The observed splitting
- between the Raman-active (4) components of v, is
caused by the difference in the static fields at the two
(nonequivalent) sites occupied by molybdenum atoms
(C; and C,).

The remaining assignments of the Raman spectrum of
crystalline MoFs proposed in Table 8.7 follow from the
example of »; discussed above: The A modes (v; and
v,) give rise to two By crystal components (Table 8.6),
but only single, weak bands were assigned to these
modes (Table 8.7). Four Raman-active crystal com-
ponents are derived from the E' modes (4 ¢ and B, from
C, site states and two 4, from Cj site states). However,
only two components each were assigned to vs and v,,
and a single component of vs; was identified at 747
cm! (Fig. 8.9 and Table 8.7). Additional components

of vs are probably obscured by the strong »; (4})
components. The E' modes, which give rise to four
Raman-active components (4, and B, from C, site
states and two B, from C; site states), exhibited only
single, weak components in the Raman spectrum of
crystalline MoF 5 (Table 8.7).

The assignment of the Raman spectrum of crystalline
MoF; proposed in Table 8.7 successfully accounts for
both the number and intensity of the observed crystal
components, especially in the stretching mode region,
in which two strong components are observed for each
of the A} modes. The treatment of Beattie et al.®
could probably be applied in assigning the modes of
crystalline MoFs, but the analysis should be based on a
tetrameric structure having C,; symmetry rather than
D,;, symmetry assumed in ref. 24,

The crystal structure of MoF, has not been de-
termined, so that a satisfactory interpretation of the
Raman spectrum (Fig. 8.10) cannot be given at this
time. However, we can tentatively identify the crystal
components as originating from vy; (4:), v2 (E), v3
(F,), and v; (F,) modes of an assumed tetrahedral
MoF,.

The strong band at 722 cm™ is a totally symmetric
component of »; (4), and one of the weaker bands at
746, 710, and 690 cm™ may be a second component
of v; (the 746-cm™ band is a likely candidate). Two of
the three weaker bands observed in this region are
probably crystal components of the v3 (F,) asymmetric

OC
 

stretching mode. Alternatively, all three of the weak
bands (746, 710, and 690 cm™') may be correlation
field components of »; (F,).

The degenerate bending modes of MoF, are probably
giving rise to the low-frequency components observed
at 280, 251, and 211 cm™ and possibly to the
low-frequency shoulder on the 251-cm™ band ob-
served at about 220 cm™ (Fig. 8.10). The bands
observed at 176 and 142 ¢cm™ may be due to external
modes of the MoF, lattice, as these frequencies have
about the correct magnitudes expected for librational
motions of the MoF,; tetrahedra. However, the 176-
cm” band could also be a correlation field component
of one of the degenerate bending modes (v, or v,).

The crystal structure of MoF; is isomorphic to that
of NbF,; hence, we might suppose that MoF4 has the

77

same structure as NbF, as determined by Gortsema and
Didchenko.2® A group theoretical analysis of the NbF,
structure (D}}), however, shows that only two k = 0
modes are Raman active:

TOP =A, +E +2A,, +B,, +3E,.

In view of the spectrum shown in Fig. 8.10, it would
not appear that the sample of MoF, observed in this
work has the NbF, structure.

9. Properties of the Alkali Fluoroborates.

9.1 SOLUBILITY OF BF; GAS IN FLUORIDE MELTS

S. Cantor W.T.Ward

The purposes of this program are: (1) to use BF;
solubility as a thermodynamic probe to determine
changes in fluoride ion activity and (2) to provide data
on how BF; might be used as a burnable neutron
poison for purposes of reactor control.

The initial data in this program were obtained on
LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) employing a double-pot
apparatus similar to that described by Shaffer et al.,! »2
in which the salt was saturated with BF; in one vessel,
after which a portion was transferred through a
connecting tube to a second vessel where the trans-
ferred melt was stripped of BF; by sparging with
helium. For greater experimental convenience we have
employed a single-pot apparatus in which the vessel of
900 cm® volume was fabricated from 2%-in. sched 40
nickel pipe.

The experimental procedure consists, as before, of
saturating the molten salt at constant pressure and
temperature and stripping with helium. After exiting
from the vessel the helium-BF; stream passes through
columns of aqueous NaF solution which remove the
BF;. The absorbed BF; is analyzed by mannitol
titration. The vapor space above the melt at the end of
the saturation consists solely of BF; gas; this quantity
of gas, easily calculated for the temperature-pressure
conditions of the run, is subtracted from the total BF,
analyzed in the absorber.

The saturating time has been about 4 hr for virtually
all the runs. Two runs in which 1-hr saturation times
were used yielded BF; solubilities 9 to 10% lower than
the 4-hr runs for the same temperatures and pressures.
Stripping data indicate that with a helium flow rate of

(1967).

78

100 cm®/min, 4 hr is sufficient to remove >99% of the
BF; from the LiF-BeF, melt.

The main advantage of the single-pot apparatus is the
elimination of the melt-transferring procedures. In the
double-pot apparatus, the two transfers per run re-
quired at least 1 hr, sometimes longer because dip lines
frequently plugged during the transfer operations.
There appear to be no disadvantages in the single-pot
system as long as the solubility of BF; is great enough
so that BF; in the gas space above the melt is small
compared with that dissolved in the melt. In LiF-BeF,
(66-34 mole %), the ratio of BF; in the gas space to

that in the liquid varied from 0.032 at 523°C t0 0.18 at

723°C (the melt occupying ~60% of the volume of the
vessel).

In the pressure range studied, 1 to 2.5 atm, Henry’s
law was obeyed. A plot of Henry’s law constants
obtained by the single-pot procedure is given by the
solid line in Fig. 9.1 using

InK =-22.1/R + 15,900/(RT) ,

where R is the gas constant, 1.987, and T is in degrees
Kelvin, The line and the scatter for the data obtained in
the double-pot procedure are also shown for compari-
son, as are the data reported by Shaffer et al.! for BF,
solubility in LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-ThF,-UF, (65-28-5-1-1
mole %). In the latter melt the solubility of BF; is
about two-thirds that in LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %). The
lesser BF; solubility is consistent with the hypothesis
that, in fluoride melts containing alkali fluoride as the
major component, M*" ion “combines” with more
fluoride ions (and therefore makes fluoride ions less
available for interaction with BF) than does Be®* ion.

Solubilities of gaseous HF have also been measured?
in LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %), and inert gases have been
measured? in a slightly different melt (64-36 mole %).

These data are summarized and compared with BF;
solubility in Table 9.1. Note that BF; ‘and HF
solubilities decrease with increasing temperature. For
BF; the magnitude of the enthalpy (AH") of solubility

79

suggests that a strong chemical interaction occurs in the
melt (perhaps the reaction BF5(g) + F~ = BF,").

There is a qualitative difference in the solubility of
BF; and HF, on one hand, as compared with the
solubility of the inert gases. Note in Table 9.1 that the
inert gas solubilities are about four orders of magnitude
less and that solubility increases with temperature. The
interaction of inert gas and the melt is probably
“physical” (in contrast to “chemical™) in which dissolu-
tion has been effectively represented* as the inert gas
making bubbles of atomic dimensions by working
against the surface tension of the liquid.

9.2 STUDIES OF HYDROGEN EVOLUTION AND
TRITIUM EXCHANGE IN FLUOROBORATE
COOLANT SALT

S. Cantor R.M. Waller

Investigations that seek to determine the extent to
which chemically bound hydrogen in low concentra-
tions will be retained in fluoroborate salts in the
presence of metals of construction were continued. If it
were noncorrosive, bound hydrogen in low concen-
trations in the melt would afford a reservoir for isotopic
exchange with tritium diffusing into the MSBR coolant
circuit. The metals of construction are those (Ni, Mo,
Cr, Fe) which constitute the heat exchanger, steam
generator-superheater, and the coolant drain tanks.

The main feature of the experimental apparatus used
in this investigation is a silica vessel connected to a
manifold from which gas samples can be removed or
added (e.g., tritium gas can be introduced). Evacuated
capsules containing salt and metal coupons were posi-
tioned within the silica vessel. The silica vessel fits into
a tube furnace. The apparatus was described previ-
ously,’

The conditions and observations of the experimental
runs are given in Table 9.2. In all cases the salt used,
NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole 9%), has an analyzed H,0
content of 120 = 60 ppm. In the analysis the moisture
was extracted from the salt with pyridine, and the
pyridine-water azeotrope was subsequently distilled
into Karl Fischer reagent. All capsules were constructed
of nickel.

The most significant experiment is run 5. The tritium
analysis of the salt shows that very little tritium

Procedure and Observations

 

While heating to 550°C, vapor pressure in silica vessel rose and reached a steady value (4 mm) in 2 hr. Gas
sample taken at this point showed 62 vol % Hj. Removal of subsequent gas samples led to decrease in
pressure, but with increases in percentage of H,. Gases were analyzed chromatographically., Assuming that

In heating to 530°C, vapor pressure in silica vessel rose steadily to 3.4 mm in 4 hr. First gas sample
contained 74% Hj; subsequent gas samples contained a higher percentage of Hj, reached 87 vol %.
Assuming all hydrogen gas came from reaction of H,O with Cr (see above) then 57 ppm H,O has reacted.

Heated to 500°C; in 1.7 hr pressure reached a steady value of 3.5 mm, of which 74 vol % was Hj.
Subsequent samples were higher in H,, From hydrogen analyses, 58 ppm H,O had reacted. After 3.5 days
at temperature, vessel and sample were cooled to room temperature and vessel and manifold were
evacuated. Then 0.098 Ci of tritium gas (T,) was introduced into the silica vessel, which was heated back
up to 500°C. The T, interacted with the sample at 500° for almost three days. After cooling, capsule was
cut open and some salt removed for tritium analysis. Another salt sample was removed after overnight
evacuation, Both samples gave precisely the same low tritium concentration — 1.61 X 1078 g-atom of T

exchanged with hydrogen in the salt. At the time the
tritium was introduced into the experiment the concen-
tration of bound hydrogen was miniscule — when
expressed in terms of H,O, the concentration was
probably less than 1 ppm. (An attempt to analyze
gaseous H,, HT, and T,, mass spectrographically,
towards the end of the experiment was unsuccessful;
hence the equilibrium ratio of bound hydrogen to
bound tritium in the salt is not known.) The results of
these experiments seem to indicate that in the presence
of chromium the fluoroborate coolant salt does not
retain sufficient H,O or OH™ ions to serve as the
tritium trap in a molten-salt reactor.

The question arises: If the salt contained 120 ppm

. H,0, how is it that in runs 3, 4, and 5 only 50 to 58

ppm H,O0 can be accounted for in terms of the gas
chromatographic analysis for hydrogen? The only an-
swer consistent with the analysis for tritium in the salt
at the end of run 5 is that the analysis of 120 ppm was
too high by about a factor of 2. Since it is known that
CsH5N-BF; is more stable than NaF-BF;, it is quite
plausible that CsHgN (pyridine) would react with any

20

NaF-B Ff

in the salt to form

CsH; N-BZD ,

some of which would be distilled into the Karl Fischer
reagent. (The

would react with methanol in the Karl Fischer reagent
to yield water, which would, of course, be reported as
water.)

9.3 REACTION OF WATER WITH
THE SODIUM FLUORIDE—-SODIUM
TETRAFLUOROBORATE EUTECTIC

Harold W. Kohn

On the basis of present knowledge,’ the equilibria in
the NaBF,4-H, 0 system can be represented by the sum
and difference of the two equations: ’

Ss. Pawlenko, Z. Anorg. Allgem, Chem, 347, 1 (1966).
 

 

NaBF, + H,0 = NaBF;0H + HF , (1)

NaBF; OH = NaBF,0 + HF . 2
A study of these equilibria was initiated in order to
assess the hydroxide concentration attainable in molten
fluoroborates and to evaluate the possibility of using
the reverse reaction as a purification method. Neither
the actual existence nor stability of NaBF;O0H in
molten fluoroborates has been established. On the basis
of standard free energy data’ and estimates of B—OH
bond energy (from the standard free energy of forma-
tion of boric acid suitably corrected for temperature)
one concludes that the standard free energy is +16.5
kcal for the first reaction and —26.5 kcal for the
second. These calculations suggest that the compound
NaBF;0H is unstable with respect to decomposition
into NaBF,0 and HF. There are additional reasons,
some presented later in this report, which lead to the
inference that NaBF3;OH is to some extent stable,
especially when dilute in molten NaBF,.

By passing HF + H,0 into 5 kg of a sodium
fluoroborate eutectic in a nickel pot containing residual
oxide and/or hydroxide, we attempted to measure the
equilibrium quotient for the reverse of the two reac-
tions shown. The concentration of HF + BF; in the
off-gas stream was determined by alkalimetry, H,O by
titration with Karl Fischer reagent, and oxide plus
hydroxide in the salt by KBrF, reaction with filtered
samples. It may be assumed that all the oxygen as
measured is present as hydroxide, as oxide, or as a
mixture of the two. If one assumes that reaction (1)
predominates (oxygen present as hydroxide), the meas-
ured equilibrium quotients,

Koo B20
' [OH] [HF]

determinations. The variation in individual determina-
tions is quite wide because of various analytical

difficulties; the interference of BF; with the Karl
Fischer titration is particularly serious. Hence the data
are not useful for calculations involving the coexistence
of oxide and hydroxide.

In a continued effort to examine the pertinence of
reactions (1) and (2), auxiliary experiments were
conductéd adding various quantities of boron oxide to
the melt. In one experiment 3 g of B, 0; was added to
the melt, and after overnight agitation the melt was
purged continuously with a gas stream containing HF.
For 1 hr the water in the effluent gas remained low,
<0.2 mg/liter, then suddenly increased about tenfold to
2 mg/liter. We assumed that this was due to the
preferential reaction of oxide first with HF to form
hydroxide followed by the reaction of hydroxide with
HF to form water. On the other hand, when we
measured HF/H,O over a range in a highly (>1000
ppm) oxide-contaminated melt, so that the oxide is
sensibly constant, the results shown in Table 9.3 were
obtained. These data suggest that the true equilibrium
quotient is more likely to be .

[H,0]
[HF]? [0%]

rather than

{H,0]
[HF] [OH]

When we passed H,O through molten NaF-NaBF,
eutectic to see whether the reverse of reaction (1) or (2)
was the preferred reaction by measuring the equivalence
of HF per molecule, the results were too erratic to be
meaningful. Again, interference from BF; is an impor-
tant factor.

We also conducted experiments using deuterium as a
tracer to test the stability of the NaBF; OD formed and
to avoid interferences from this ubiquitous H, O which
could arise from accidental contamination. A gas stream
containing D,O vapor was passed into a NaF-NaBF,

eutectic melt at 400 and 550°C. The amount of
deuterium which remained in the salt was determined
by reaction with metallic chromium in a sealed capsule?

3NaBF;0D +Cr° - CrF; + 3NaBF,0 + %D, . (3)

The hydrogen gas generated in the reaction was purified

82

in the process by diffusion through the sealed capsule.

Most of the gas so collected was protium, corresponding
to 300 to 500 ppm OH™ which, presumably, remained
from the previous experiment. A small amount might
also have been contributed by a handling blank. A
nonnegligible amount of deuterium was, however,
retained by the salt and released by reaction (3), but
this was less than 5% of the total deuterium added. The

"results are summarized in Table 9.4.

It was anticipated that half of the added D,0O would
be lost immediately as DF by reaction (1), and an
additional amount might be lost as a result of corrosion
reactions. The apparent retention of a small fraction of
deuterium leaves open the possibility that a small
amount of hydrogenous species can be retained in
sodium fluoroborate at 400°. The release of protium in
this experiment, corresponding to results obtained by
Cantor and Waller,® suggests rather an artifact effect.

An auxiliary observation we have made is that in spite
of the addition of comparatively large amounts of
B,0; and of water to the fluoroborate melts, none of
the filtered samples contained greater than 816 ppm of
0%, although, according to inventory calculations, the
concentration could have been as high as 2500 ppm.
This result suggests the separation of an oxide-rich
phase which has been reported cursorily before®* ® but
the existence of which Pawlenko disputes.® Indeed, if

we use a saturation value for oxide of 816 ppm to
calculate the equilibrium quotients from the data in
Table 9.4, we get, respectively, K; = 0.85, 1.2, and 1.85
and K,"K, = 166, 175, and 215, in reasonable
agreement with the previous 460° data. Analysis of the
samples has also indicated segregation of an oxygen-rich
phase during cooling of fluoroborate melts, suggesting
that solubility of oxides in these melts is quite
limited.!!

9.4 RAMAN SPECTRA OF MOLTEN NaBF,
AND NaF-NaBF, TO 606°C

Arvin S. Quist John B. Bates George E. Boyd

Studies of the vibrational spectra of molten salts
provide the possibility of directly identifying poly-
atomic species which may exist in the melt and also
indicating the extent and nature of interionic interac-
tions in these liquids. Differences in the vibrational
spectra of an ion observed in the “free” and the molten
state may be attributed to cation-anion complex forma-
tion in the latter or to interactions with quasi-lattice
states in the melt, depending on the magnitude and
type of the changes observed.

Raman spectroscopy is particularly well suited for
studying the tetrahedral tetrafluoroborate anion (BF,"),
because all four normal modes of vibration are Raman
active, The characteristic vibrational spectrum of the
BF,” ion in molten salts has not been obtained until
now, primarily because these melts are very corrosive
toward the usual optical window materials. However,
the recently developed windowless cells for laser Raman
spectroscopy of fused salts’? can be used to study
these melts.

reported earlier'* were assigned, and the observed band
splitting was discussed in terms of the anistropic forces
acting on the BF, ion in the crystal lattice. The
observed wave number difference between the high-
frequency components of the BF, fundamentals in
crystalline NaBF; and those observed in the melt
(Table 9.5) can be attributed to anisotropy at the site
occupied by BF, in the crystal lattice. The lack of any
evidence for splitting of the bands in molten NaBF,
(ie., as separate components or as shoulders on the
main bands) indicates that there is no cation-anion
complex formation; the BF,™ ion in the melt is in an
isotropic environment. This conclusion is supported by
the close agreement between the spectrum of the 3 M
aqueous solution and the melt spectra (Table 9.5),
because the spectrum in solution can be considered as
arising from the “free jon.”

In general the band maxima in molten NaBF,
appeared to shift to lower frequencies with increasing
temperature. For example, the maximum intensity of
the », band was observed at 776 cm™' at 414°C, while
at 606°C its frequency was 772 cm™'. The shift to
lower frequencies of the BF,™ vibrations as the tempera-
ture of the melt is increased may be due to the
increased population of higher vibrational levels or to
changes in the effective force constants of BF,”
resulting from changes in cation-anion interactions as
the temperature is changed. It should also be pointed
out that, similar to the behavior of molten perchlo-
rates,' 2°29 no low-frequency, quasi-attice vibrations of
the type common to nitrate melts were observed in
molten NaBF,.

9.5 ELECTRONIC POLARIZABILITY OF THE
TETRAFLUOROBORATE ION AND VARIOUS
GASEOUS HALIDE MOLECULES AS COMPARED
WITH THE FREE (GASEOUS) HALIDE IONS

M. A. Bredig

Together with the polarizing power, mainly of the
positive ion, the polarizability of the negative ion is one
of the important fundamental parameters determining
the chemical and physical properties of a salt. For
example, the large difference in the polarizabilities of
the C1™ and F~ ions is implicitly the basis of the metal
transfer process using a chloride melt for purposes of

separations presently under development. Unfortu-
nately, there is considerable confusion in the literature
in regard to the use of proper standard ion polariza-
bilities with which to compare the measured polar-
izabilities of a given salt. We are dealing in the following
with a brief discussion of this problem as applied to (1)
the tetrafluoroborate ion, of great current interest to
the Molten-Salt Reactor Program, (2) a number of
halides of polyvalent elements similar to boron, and (3)
some “anomalous” behavior found with tri- and tetra-
halides of the larger, more highly polarizable halide
ions, Br and I".

9.5.1 The Polarizability of the Tetrafluoroborate Ion

The polarizabilities, o,,, of the alkali metal tetra-
fluoroborates, MBF, , measured by Cantor, McDermott,
and Gilpatrick®' were used together with the polariza-
bilities of the free (gaseous) cations, a, , given by Fajans
and co-workers,?? to derive a_ = a, — a, for BF; in
these crystals (Table 9.6).

In the salts of sodium to cesium, a_ = 3.06 + 0.04 A3
does not show a systematic change, This is as expected,
because in M(BF,) the weak field of M* (“ionic
potential,” z/r = 1.05 to 0.6 as compared with z/r =~ 15
for B®") contributes very little to the tightening of the
electron shells, which is Ao/4 = —0.84/4 = —0.21 A3
(21%) per F~ ion. In the alkali sulfates, Aa = —1.40 +
0.03 A3 per 0?” and Aaja = 49% are similarly constant.

An apparent trend for a_, from 2.87 A? in Na(BF,)
to 2.29 in Cs(BF,), reported earlier,2’ was merely the
result of the very misleading nature of the average solid-
state polarizabilities proposed for the cations by Tess-
man, Kahn, and Shockley? which were used in the
calculations and which are inconsistent with the obser-
vation of distinct systematic deviations from additivity
in the alkali halides.

The polarizability of BF," in the lithium salt, a_ <3 4
A® (see Table 9.6), is not accessible at present to
more exact measurement but most likely resembles that
of the other four salts, a_ = 3.0 A3.

It seems noteworthy that the amount of the tight-
ening in BF;", —0.21 A® per F~, appears to be not
smaller, as might have been expected from the larger

conclude, as Fajans did by applying his method of

9.5.3. Effect of Interaction Between Halide
Ions on Polarizability

The values of Aafa for BCl; and BBr; in Fig. 9.5
represent a smaller tightening of Cl™ and Br™ than
expected from that of F~ in BF; (dashed curve). I
propose as an explanation a mutual interaction, such as
a “loosening” of the larger, more highly polarizable
halide ions Br™ and I”, when “crowded” around a small
ion such as B*". This interpretation applies also to a
similar experimental observation reported for Al, Is and
to a smaller degree for Al, Brg in the series of the three
aluminum trihalide dimer molecules.®®3? Here the
tightening of I”, —Aajo = 0.089, and also that of Br,
—Aafa = 0.144, is smaller than expected in comparison
with that of C17, —Aaf/a = 0.153 (Fig. 9.6). Quite
similarly, in the carbon and silicon tetrahalides, CX,
and SiX, , the apparent tightening increases at first from
—Aafa = 0.24 and 0.18 in the fluorides to 0.26 and
0.21 in the chlorides but then decreases to 0.24 and
0.19 in the bromides. By analogy with Al,I¢ a further
decrease must surely be anticipated for the iodides, for
which data do not seem to be available.

The mutual interaction of the halide ions here
referred to may consist of a mutual loosening of the
electron shells near the periphery of the molecule.

L.O. Gilpatrick C.J.Barton H. Insley

Bauman and Chang! have recently recommended that
the salt composition LiF-BeF, -ThF, (70-15-15 mole %)
be adopted as the optimum composition for succeeding
studies of the permanent-core single-fluid MSBR. In
view of its probable importance in future reactor design
considerations, we thought it desirable to confirm the
liquidus temperature and the primary phase assignment
of this specific composition.

The composition was prepared from the pure compo-
nents and examined by the quench tube technique. It
was found to have a melting point of 505 + 2°C, and
the primary phase was identified from its optical
properties as 3LiF-ThF,. The liquidus temperature was
confirmed by an independent set of three differential
thermal analysis (D.T.A.) measurements which averaged
506.3 + 1°C.

Results agree very well with the published phase
diagram in'all respects.’

10.2 EQUILIBRIUM PHASE RELATIONSHIPS
IN THE SYSTEM LiF-BeF, -CeF,

L.O.Gilpatrick H.Insley C.J. Barton

Investigation of this system was reported earlier’ and
has progressed far enough to warrant the preparation of
a tentative phase diagram (Fig. 10.1). Additional data
have been obtained using the gradient quench tech-
nique. The solubility of CeF; in LiF-BeF, composi-
tions was measured’ earlier® and correlated with other

CeF; solubility measurements.’ Interest in the system
stems chiefly from the analogy between the behavior of
CeF; and PuF;.® a possible fuel constituent.” .

Four primary phase fields have been identified in this
system, of which the largest is CeF;, as expected from
its high melting point (1459°C). Lithium fluoride forms
the next most extensive primary phase field, followed
by 2LiF‘BeF,. Adjoining or contained in this field are
the lowest-melting compositions in the system, ‘the
lowest being the ternary eutectic melting at 358°C
having the approximate composition LiF-BeF,-CeF;
(47.5-52.00.5 mole %). As CeF; is added to a mixture of
this composition there is a sharp rise in the liquidus
temperature. This can be seen from the closely spaced
isothermal contours tracing the liquidus boundary in
Fig. 10.1. For example, when as little as 3 mole % CeF;
is added to the LiF-BeF, eutectic composition melting
at 360°C, the equilibrium liquidus temperature rises to
635°C.

At higher BeF, compositions, such as those above 80
mole %, the experimental difficulties entailed in secur-
ing equilibrium data mount rapidly because of the high
viscosity of liquid BeF, . Additional data will be needed
to refine the present diagram at high BeF, composi-
tions. At the higher CeF; compositions, the need for
high-temperature techniques has been a limitation.

Invariant compositions and their temperatures can be
read from Fig. 10.1. They represent tentative values
based upon our present understanding of the system,

ThF,. Preliminary results were given for this subsystem
in an earlier report? Some progress has been made in
overcoming the experimental problems referred to
earlier when using the quench-tube technique at tem-
peratures between 1000 and 1200°C. Inserting a graph-
ite liner with a cap into the nickel furnace core has
prevented the nickel-to-nickel welding between sample
tube and core which previously resulted in many lost
heats. Use of Rodar alloy (Fe-Ni-Co-Mn, 51-29-17-3 at.
%) quench tubes which have a greater strength at
1200°C than pure nickel has also reduced the failure
rate, although neither it nor other commonly available
alloys are found to possess both entirely adequate
strength and corrosion resistance in this temperature
range.

A preliminary phase diagram is presented in Fig. 10.2
which represents our present understanding of this
system. The compositions region greater than 40 mole
% in ThF, has been examined in sufficient detail at

temperatures below 1100°C to give a fairly clear picture
of the system in this region. A eutectic is formed at 45
mole % ThF, between CeF,-2ThF, and ThF,; it
exhibits the lowest melting temperature in the system,
estimated to be 950°C. Thorium fluoride is the primary
phase at higher ThF, compositions, but the compound
CeF3-2ThF, is the primary phase for only a narrow
composition range from the eutectic to 73 mole %
ThF,. At this composition a peritectic is found which is
formed by the incongruent melting of CeF3-2ThF, at
960°C.

A second peritectic is formed when the compound
CeF;-ThF, melts incongruently at about 1155°C. At
higher temperatures the only stable solid phase is CeF,
solid solution. From the change in optical properties,
we infer the existence of a CeF; solid solution; but
more work is needed to define the extent of this region
as shown by the dotted lines. Below approximately
860°C CeF;-2ThF, is unstable, and only ThF, and .
CeF; solid solution exists. Additional information is
needed especially in the temperature range above
1100°C to complete this study.

10.4 THE INSTABILITY OF PuOF AND THE
SOLUBILITY OF Pu(III) IN MSBR SOLVENT SALT

C.E. Bamberger R.G.Ross C.F.Baes, Ir.

We have previously reported® measurements of the
following equilibrium involving the oxidative precipita-
tion of plutonium oxide at 590 and 690°:

3/4ThO, (ss) + 1/2NiO(c) + PuF,(d)
= Pu0, (ss) + 3/4ThF 4(d) + 1/2Ni’(c),

where ss, ¢, and d denote, respectively, a solid solution
of PuO, and ThO,, pure crystalline phases, and
components dissolved in LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12
mole %). From these results and available thermochemi-
cal data for the other reactants, we were able to
estimate the free energy of formation of PuF; and to
conclude therefrom that under the normal reducing
conditions of an MSBR fuel there was no possibility of
precipitating plutonium as PuO,, Pu0, ¢,, or PuO, ;.
One other oxygen-containing compound of Pu(III) has
been reported by early workers! ® from x-ray examina-

tion of impurities formed during the reduction of PuF;
by atomic hydrogen and during the determination of
the melting points of PuF; in an argon atmosphere.
Indeed, Oetting'! has estimated the thermochemical
values for PuOF by comparison with those for PuOClI,
PuCl;, and PuF;. Using his estimation procedure and
our revised estimate for the formation free energy of
PuF;, we would predict the precipitation of PuOF by
the addition of ThO, to a molten fluoride containing
PuF;. This has been clearly ruled out, however, by one
of our previously reported tests in which an addition of
excess oxide failed to remove a detectable amount of
Pu(Ill) from such a molten fluoride solution nearly
saturated with PuF; (0.21 mole % at 494°C). Thus the
PuOF clearly is less stable than might be judged from
Oetting’s estimation procedure.

The present measurements were made in order to
confirm previous estimates of the solubility of PuF; in
LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) and to determine if
the presence of oxide has any effect on that solubility.
While it appears that the solubility is not decreased by
the precipitation of an oxyfluoride, the possibility
remains that it might be increased by the formation of an
oxy ion such as PuO™,

The experimental procedure consisted in equilibrating
the melt with excess PuF; (containing ~0.1% 24! Am)

Y1g 1. Qetting, Chem. Rev. 67, 261 (1967).
 

 

by sparging the mixture with argon at 120 cc/min for
several (4—16) hours. The plutonium concentration was
determined by alpha pulse-height analysis of 23?Pu and
by neutron activation analysis. The 2*'Am present
showed the same distribution behavior as 23°Pu
between the crystalline PuF; and the melt and there-
fore was used as a tracer for rapid analysis during the
runs. In runs with ThO, present, stirring was used for
mixing the phases under an atmosphere of Ar+ 4% H,.
The reducing atmosphere was used in order to avoid the
formation of PuQ,-ThO, solid solution in case of
accidental contamination with air.

The solubility of PuF; measured in the presence and
absence of ThO, was the same within the scatter of the
analytical data (Fig. 10.3). This indicates that an oxy
ion of plutonium III, such as PuO™, has no significant
stability in the molten fluoride solvent used. Thus PuO*
appears to form neither a stable solid fluoride nor a
stable species in molten fluoride.

The results of the various analyses used to determine
the solubility of PuF, in 72-16-12 salt (Fig. 10.3) were
fitted by least squares, giving

The heat of solution of PuF; was estimated from this

These results are nearly identical with those obtained
by Barton et al.'? for CeF, in the same solvent salt,
72-16-12, thus confirming the suitability of CeF; as a
proxy for plutonium in the earlier measurements.

10.5 OXIDE CHEMISTRY OF PROTACTINIUM
IN MSBR FUEL SOLVENT SALT

R.G.Ross C.E.Bamberger C.F.Baes, Jr.

The precipitation of protactinium from LiF-BeF,-
ThF, molten mixtures by oxide additions was demon-
strated by Shaffer ef al. some years ago.}® When it later
became apparent from reductive extraction measure-
ments that the valence of protactinium in such melts
was +4, it was generally assumed that the oxide
precipitated in these earlier experiments was PaO,.
Furthermore, since UO, and ThO, form solid solutions
in equilibrium with such melts when UF is present,’*
it seemed likely that protactinium was precipitated by
the formation of a (U-Pa-Th)O, solid solution.

The present further investigation of the oxide chem-
istry of protactinium in molten fluorides was under-
taken by us to identify the oxide phases of protactin-
ium which are precipitated under various conditions
and to measure the related equilibria. In an initial test
(Fig. 10.4) an LiF-BeF, -ThF, melt containing 100 ppm
of protactinium was treated with an excess of UO,
more than sufficient to precipitate all the protactinium.
Surprisingly, only a small fraction (~10%) of the
protactinium was precipitated. A subsequent addition
of hyperstoichiometric UO, (an oxidant), however,
caused a sharp increase in the amount of protactinium
precipitated. Hydrogen sparging of the mixture

returned much of this protactinium to solution, while’

subsequent addition of NiF, (an oxidant) again in-
creased the amount of protactinium precipitated. It is

concentration was 100 ppm.

clear from these results that the extent of protactinium
precipitation as oxide increases with increased oxida-
tion of the system. It seems likely that a Pa(V) oxide,
presumably a pure phase or a solid solution of Pa, Os
with ThO,, was the principal oxide formed in these
tests and in the previous tests of Shaffer ez al.'3

In order to characterize more directly the protactin-
ium oxide precipitated, an LiF-BeF,-ThF, mixture
(72-16-12 mole %) containing 3000 ppm protactinium
was extensively hydrofluorinated with HF at ~0.7 atm
to dissolve any oxides initially present and to oxidize
the protactinium to the pentavalent state. This was
followed by equilibration at several temperatures with
small amounts of ThO, added stepwise in a leak-tight
stirred vessel'® assembled in a glove box suited for
work with alpha-active material. The results obtained
are shown in Fig. 10.5 as the number of moles of
protactinium in solution plotted vs total moles of 0%"
added. It can be seen that at 563°C, the experimental
points agree well with a line calculated on the assump-
tion that the protactinium was precipitated quantita-
tively as Pa,Os. From this we conclude that the
precipitated oxide is pure or nearly pure Pa, Os. At
higher temperatures the amount of protactinium in
solution was well above the line corresponding to
complete precipitation. Calculating the amount of
oxide ion in solution by a material balance based on the

Uses
These estimates of the solubility products of ThO, {Eq.

mole %) are in reasonably good agreement with
previous estimates!® of these quantities in Li; BeF,
melts, considering the uncertainties involved and the
change in medium. We are thus encouraged to believe
that the protactinium was precipitated in these tests as
pure or nearly pure PaO; and that the present
estimate of its low solubility is a usefully accurate one.

which relates the saturation concentration of PaFs in
the presence of Pa, 05(c) to the oxide ion concentra-
tion in the melt — here expressed in terms of the
activity of UO, — and the UF, concentration. This,
then, is a useful representation of the behavior to be
expected in an MSBR fuel. In the absence of protactin-
ium, sufficient oxide will cause the precipitation of a
UO, rich (~95 mole %) solid solution with ThO,.}*
Such a precipitate would establish a UQ, activity near
unity (Fig. 10.7). With PaF; present, equilibrium
described in Eq. (6) would apply, showing clearly that
the amount of PaFs remaining in a solution saturated
with Pa, Os depends on the concentration of UF, in
the fuel and on the oxide activity. The behavior
predicted from the present estimate of the equilibrium
quotient for reaction (6) is indicated in Fig. 10.7. From
this we conclude that it should be possible to selectively
precipitate protactinium as pure or nearly pure Pa, Os
from an MSBR fuel salt without prior removal of
uranium, This important conclusion will be verified by
precipitation tests on melts containing both uranium
and protactinium.,

The redox potential required to produce the PaF; in
such a melt remained to be estimated. This was

inadvertent precipitation as Pa, Os.

The equilibrium quotients Q4 and Qs may be used to
estimate the conditions under which 233Pa might be
isolated as Pa, Os in an MSBR. If oxide is added to an

From this expression it can be seen that the concentra-
tion of protactinium in the effluent from the decay
tank will be minimized by (1) lowering Q¢ (ie.,
lowering the temperature), (2) lowering the ratio of the
UF, concentration to the activity of dissolved UO,
(ayo ,) — presumably by increasing the latter, and (3)
lowering the ratio of UF; to UF,. Based on the present
estimates of Q¢ and Q,, it is thus predicted that with
an XypF, [Xu F, ratio less than 107° and with an oxide
concentration equivalent to a UQ, activity of 0.5,
which should be insufficient to precipitate a uranium-
rich oxide phase, it should be possible to lower the
protactinium concentration of a fuel stream to ~20
ppm by precipitation of Pa, Os.

The current program of investigation includes experi-
ments which are designed to define the redox potential
of the Pa®*/Pa*" couple with high precision because of
the significance of this value to the control of precipita-
tion of protactinium as oxide in molten-salt reactors.
Subsequently, the present estimate of the extent to
which. protactinium may be selectively precipitated as
Pa, Os in the presence of UF, , without precipitation of
UO, as a pure phase or as an oxide solid solution, will
be verified in direct tests.

10.6 ENTROPIES OF MOLTEN SALTS

The entropies of several classes of inorganic com-
pounds in both the liquid and solid states are currently
being correlated. An equation that has been developed

maximum discrepancy between calculated and experi-
mental S;000 for these cases is 1.4 cal mole™ deg™.

When Eq. (1) is applied to the entropies at 1000°K of
eight molten alkaline-earth halides (note that n = 3), the
average value of 4 = —13.4. The correlation is poorer
than for the alkali halides; the worst discrepancy
between calculated and experimental S7gg0 is 6 cal
mole deg.

The success in correlating the entropies of alkali and
other univalent halides has led to extensions of Eq. (1)
for estimating the entropies of more complex com-
pounds. Among these are salts containing a complex
anion (examples: fluoroborates, hydroxides, nitrates,
carbonates, and sulfates). In these compounds it can be
assumed that the anions exhibit “gaslike” degrees of
freedom. In other words, in the melt the complex
anions execute rotations and the atoms within the
anion execute internal vibrations, both types of motion
being unhindered by the immediate environment. When
these assumptions are included in the calculated
entropy, Eq. (1) is modified:

In applying Eq. (2) to nine compounds with univalent
anions, the constant A at 1000°K was assumed to be
the same (0.62) as for the univalent halides. The
calculated and experimental entropies are given in the
upper part of Table 10.2. Only LiOH exhibits a sizable
discrepancy between observed and calculated values.
For melts of divalent anions, the constant 4 was
obtained from Eq. (2) using the experimental S;¢¢0(1)
of Na,SO, (hence in Table 10.2 observed and calcu-
lated entropies for Na, SO, must agree). Equation (2),
with 4 = —17, was then applied to four other alkali
melts containing divalent anions. The results for these
four, given in Table 10.2, show fairly good agreement,
with Li, CO; showing the worst discrepancy.

The experimental entropies of the two lithium com-
pounds, LiOH and Li, CO;, are both considerably less
than the calculated values. A possible explanation for
this discrepancy is that the anionic rotation is not
totally free — perhaps the relatively large electric field
strength of the lithium ions acts to hinder the free
rotation of the anion.

10.7 ALL-METAL CONDUCTANCE CELL
FOR USE IN MOLTEN SALTS

G.D. Robbins J. Braunstein

Electrically insulating materials which are inert to
molten fluorides are rare. Previously, we have employed
conductance cells constructed of silica with molten
LiF-BeF, mixtures,! over ranges of temperature and
composition where the degree of attack was small and
did not influence the conductance results. This imposed
an undesirable limitation on the range of salt composi-
tions and temperatures amenable to study. For ex-
ample, it did not prove possible to supercool these
melts in the presence of silica, probably due to the
presence of corrosion product precipitates. Thus infor-
mation on that part of the liquid range where transport
properties are changing most rapidly with temperature
— the supercooled region — could not be investigated.
Drawing on the experience of previous investigators of
molten fluorides,?? a new conductance apparatus has
been designed and constructed? in which only metal
contacts the molten fluoride melts. The cell is designed
to permit conductance measurements in an inert atmos-
phere and is compatible with the currently employed
silica and Lavite furnace.?* Provision is also made for
the periodic addition of s6lid salt under a protective
atmosphere.

Figure 10.8 is a schematic drawing of the "metal
conductance apparatus. The melt is contained in a
nickel cup (6.6 cm ID, 9 cm high) resting on three silica
pegs and enclosed in a silica well 8.3 cm in diameter and
34 cm high. The silica well fits into a silica and Lavite

The two platinum electrodes are concentric cylinders
Heliarc welded to unplatinized platinum rods. The
outer electrode is 4 cm in diameter and 1.5 cm high,
while the dimensions of the inner cylinder are 0.5 X 0.5
cm. The two replaceable electrodes are rendered im-
mobile relative to each other by means of a Lavite
spacer holding tightly fitted nickel rods into which the
platinum support rods are inserted and held by nickel
screws. This affords the capability of modifying the
electrode size and configuration to accommodate vary-
ing electrochemical demands. The Lavite spacer also
serves as a heat baffle to reduce convective currents in
the glass envelope. The three electrode supports rise
through the Pyrex cell top (joined to the silica well by a
102/75 ground glass joint) through heavy-walled Pyrex
pipes. Double O-ring seals provide protection against
atmospheric contamination. The maximum vertical
displacement of the electrode assembly is 8 cm, The
length of the silica well is such that the upper portion
of the apparatus shown in Fig. 10.8, including the
ground joint, is above the cooling collar and outside the
furnace.

Two Teflon core stopcocks admit and release an inert
cover gas. If gas bubbling into the melt is desired, the
retractable nickel bubbling tube is used. The movable
nickel thermocouple well and bubbler are admitted in
the same manner as the electrode supports.

A Pyrex bulb for adding frozen salt to the melt is
shown joined to the top by a ground glass joint.
Normally a Pyrex cap fills this joint while salt is loaded
into the addition chamber in an inert-atmosphere dry
box. While rapidly expelling inert gas, the addition
chamber is positioned onto the glass joint. Depression
of the plunger lowers the Teflon cone, permitting salt
to fall down the silica addition tube which terminates
just above the nickel cup. In this way salt additions are
made with minimum exposure to atmospheric moisture.

The cell has been satisfactorily leak tested (empty) up
to 500°C. Room temperature tests in dilute aqueous

KCl and KC1-H,O-dioxane mixtures are currently in

progress and indicate a cell constant of the order of 0.1

10.8 GLASS TRANSITION TEMPERATURES
IN NaF-BeF, MIXTURES

G.D. Robbins J. Braunstein

In the recent development of transport theories of
molten salts,2527 attention has been focused on the
lower end of the liquid range — the supercooled region.
Supported by the concept of a vanishing free volume? ®

99

or configurational entropy?®>3° at temperatures above

0°K, it has been suggested®>:27 that the heat capacity
of a supercooled liquid (in metastable equilibrium)
must drop rapidly, as the temperature is reduced, to
values near those of the crystalline phase. This is in
order to avoid the implausibility of an (amorphous)
liquid phase having lower entropy than the correspond-
ing crystal. The temperature of such a transition has
been termed a *‘theoretical glass transition tempera-
ture,” Tp, and is thought to lie near, but somewhat
below, the experimental glass transition temperature,
T,. Attempts at comparing T, obtained from analysis
of conductance data from supercooled nitrate? and
acetate! melts with experimental glass transitions have
previously been reported. No such information is
available for molten fluorides.

As part of an investigation of transport and thermo-
dynamic properties in molten fluorides, glass transition
temperatures have been measured by differential ther-
mal analysis®? for three glass-forming NaF-BeF, mix-
tures. These melt compositions correspond to the
congruently melting compound NaBeF; (mp 376°C),
the eutectic at 55 mole % BeF, (365°C), and 60 mole
% BeF, (liquidus = 405°C).33-34

hydrogen. These were ground to 100 mesh in a
controlled-atmosphere box (moisture content <0.1
ppm, continuously monitored), and 10-g quantities of
the requisite weighed proportions (+0.1 mole %) were
mixed on a rotating tumbler. Approximately 3 g of
each mixed material was subsequently loaded into
predried nickel DTA sample tubes, evacuated at 100°C,
and welded closed. Heating for approximately 20 hr at
850°C with intermittent inversions and shaking was
followed by quenching into. ice water. The exterior of
the nickel cell (wall thickness = 0.5 mm) experienced
the 850° temperature drop in approximately 2 sec.

Figure 10.9 shows reproductions of actual pen traces
from DTA warmups at heating rates of 2°/min for the
three compositions. The ordinate represents the temper-
ature difference (in microvolts) between one thermo-
couple in an aluminum oxide reference sample and a
second thermocouple monitoring the fluoride glass, the
temperature of which is shown as the abscissa. The
upper portion of the figure depicts duplicate warmups
on glass formed by quenching the 50 mole % BeF,
mixture. The initial part of the trace corresponds to the
difference in heat absorption of the Al;O; and glass
sample with its characteristic heat capacity, Cp ,555- At
117°C the heat capacity of the sample exhibits a
pronounced change corresponding to an endothermic
process. This is interpreted as the glass transition,
subsequent heating reflecting the heat capacity of a
mobile amorphous phase persisting until the onset of
crystallization.

Similar behavior is exhibited by the eutectic composi-
tion, as shown in the center section of Fig. 10.9. Here
trace 1 corresponds to the glass formed by cooling 850°
in ~2 sec. After observation of the glass transition but
prior to the onset of crystallization, the sample was
slowly cooled (100° in ~4 hr), followed by a second
warmup. The same value of T, = 117 (¥2°C) was
observed as at the higher quenching rate. Traces 3 and 4
are a repeat of the experiment at a different heating
rate after which the temperature was again cycled past
T, following crystallization (trace 5). The absence of
thermal effects in cycle 5 is consistent with the
interpretation that the double peaks in the 200 to 250°
region represent crystallization of the liquid, the result-
ing crystalline phase exhibiting no solid state transitions
over this interval and, of course, no glass transition.

The lower portion of the figure represents results
obtained on a quench from the primary phase field of
BeF,, and again T,’s of 117 (£2°C) were observed.
Examination of the glass of the eutectic composition by
powder x-ray diffraction and polarizing light petrog-
raphy®® did not indicate the existence of microscopic
phase separation. Thus it appears that over the composi-
tion range investigated here, the experimental glass
transition temperature of 117 (+2°C) is invariant with
composition.

10.9 CORRELATIONS OF ELECTRICAL
CONDUCTIVITIES IN MOLTEN
LiF-BeF,-ThF, MIXTURES

G.D.Robbins A. S. Gallanter®”

In a previous report>® we communicated specific
electrical conductance data for six molten lithium-
beryllium-thorium fluoride mixtures ranging in com-
position from 73-16-11 to 60.5-28.0-11.5 mole %
LiF-BeF,-ThF,. Among these were several proposed
MSBR fuel compositions. For these mixtures specific
conductances were well represented as linear functions
of temperature from near the liquidus to 650°C. In
order to interpolate between the experimental composi-
tions, and as an aid in estimating conductances of
nearby compositions, attempts to obtain a smoothly
varying correlation of conductance as a function of
composition have been made.

A number of correlations were tested: (1) for the
specific conductance (the conductance of one cubic
centimeter of melt), (2) for the conductance of one
equivalent of fluoride ions, Ap, and (3) for the
conductance per equivalent of lithium ions, A; ;. These
are related as A = k/Cq, Where Cgq is the concentra
tion (in equivalents per cubic centimeter) of the
assumed charge-carrying constituent and p is the
density. Hence,

adequately represented the isothermal data. Further-
more, a, b, and c¢ appeared to be linear functions of

more complex combinations of composition would also
produce smooth correlations.

It is not to be expected that extrapolations of these
correlation functions to distant regions of the phase
diagram should accurately predict values of conduct-
ance. The primary utility of the correlations lies in the

ternary composition region near which the data are

10.10 COORDINATION EFFECTS ON U(1V)
SPECTRA IN FLUORIDE MELTS

L.M. Toth

The investigation of coordination effects on U(IV)
spectra in molten fluorides has continued in an effort to
broaden our understanding of how these effects influ-
ence both the spectrum and the reactivity of pertinent
transition metal ions in solution. Spectra demonstrating
a change from one species present in fluoride-rich
low-temperature melts to another present in fluoride-
deficient high-temperature melts have been shown
previously.*® The characteristic transitions of each
species are listed in Table 10.4 along with absorption
coefficients of some major peaks.

Previous experience with transition metal ions in
molten salts indicates that these changes originate
primarily from an interaction of the solvent anions in
the first coordination sphere with central metal ion.
Identification of these changes could, in principle, be
accomplished by energy-level calculations.*! However,
this method is, at the moment, not refined to the point
where changes as shown in Table 10.4 for the actinides
can be unequivocally identified. A more direct method
is by comparison of the melt spectra with crystal
spectra where the coordination of the cation has been

~ described by an independent means — x-ray crystal-

lography. Such an approach is ordinarily hampered by a
lack of corresponding single-crystal structural informa-
tion. However, fluoride single crystals have been under
examination for some years now at this laboratory,*?
so that an accumulation of fluoride crystal structural
information is available.

Host crystals of general formula A, Th,F,,,,, (where
A is an alkali metal) doped with approximately 1 mole
% U(IV) in the sites of known fluoride ion coordination
number have been grown. Spectra of these U(IV)
crystals have been measured from 25 to 550°C.
Representative spectra of 9, 8, and 7 coordination are
shown in Figs. 10.12—10.14, with characteristic peaks
and noteworthy absorption coefficients listed in Table
10.4. Comparison of the two melt species spectra
(Table 104) with 9-, 8-, and 7-coordinated U(IV)
crystal spectra at 550°C (Table 10.5) leads to the
conclusion that the fluoride-rich species is UFg* and
the fluoride-deficient is UF,3 — apparently in an
equilibrium which is dependent upon the F ~ concentra-
tion:

UFg* = UF,> +F".

The identification of the UFg? species in solution is
based on the close agreement of the melt spectrum with

the well-established crystal species. However, the identi-
fication of the UF,3 species is less certain because the
crystal structure is not as well established (being of a
defect-type structure*3) and because the spectrum
undergoes gross changes upon heating from 25 to
550°C.** Very good agreement between both peak
position and intensity of this 550° crystal spectrum and
the fluoride-deficient melt spectrum cannot be over-
looked, and therefore the cautious conclusion is drawn
that the two species, crystalline and melt, are the
same.*® Confirmation that the crystal structure at
550°C is still 7-coordinated would strengthen this
conclusion, :

Turning from the identification of the species, it is
possible to use the spectral measurements at 550°C for
an estimation of relative concentrations of the two

the UF3*/UF,3 ratios are 0.66 and 0.177 respec-

LiF-BeF, system.*’

The 7- and 8-coordination equilibrium does not agree
with conclusions drawn by Baes using the polymer
model to calculate coordination numbers.*® He calcu-
lates much lower coordination numbers for the very
analogous Th(IV) ion. Although this discrepancy has
been discussed, it has not been resolved.*” It should be
stressed, however, that the melt coordination numbers
determined by spectroscopy are by direct comparison
of known crystal spectra with melt spectra. There is
agreement both in peak position and intensity, account-
ing for all*® of the U(IV) as either 7 or 8 coordinated.
Data of this nature therefore demonstrate the validity
of predictions made from simple models.

11. Chemistry of Molten-Salt Reactor Fuel Technology

11.1 REMOVAL OF FLUORIDE FROM MOLTEN
LiCl

F.A.Doss W.R.Grimes . J, H. Shaffer

During operation of the MSBR fuel reprocessing plant
by the reductive extraction process, rare earths will be
back-extracted from molten bismuth into molten lith-
ium chloride. This process step provides, as its primary
feature, for the separation of rare earths from thorium.
If the fluoride fuel is entrained or has finite solubility in
the molten bismuth stream, contamination of the
molten LiCl system will occur. In this event thorium
will be more readily extracted into the chloride phase,
and the corresponding separation of rare earths from
thorium will become less effective. Thus a process for
stripping fluoride ion from molten chlorides may be
required for the satisfactory operation of the fuel
reprocessing plant. This experimental program has
examined the reaction

BCl,(g) + 3LiF(d) = 3LiCK(]) + BF;(g)

for possible application to MSBR fuel reprocessing
technology.

The experimental procedure was similar to that used
for studying the removal of chloride ion from a
simulated MSBR fuel solvent.! Boron trichloride
admixed with hydrogen was bubbled through molten
LiCl at 650°C to which known amounts of LiF had
been added. Samples of the gas influent and effluent
streams were periodically collected in water and ana-
lyzed by titration with standard caustic solution.
Filtered samples of the molten salt were also withdrawn
at intervals during the reaction period and analyzed for
fluoride ion,

The results from four of eight experiments conducted
thus far are shown in Fig. 11.1; they demonstrate the

effectiveness of this method for removing fluoride ion
from molten LiCl. Initial concentrations of 5000 to
10,000 ppm by weight fluoride were rapidly diminished
to low values within the 4-hr reaction periods at low
BCl; concentration (0.8 millimole per liter of H;) in
the sparge gas stream.

After establishing that essentially complete fluoride
removal from LiCl (<40 ppm) could be achieved, the

purpose of subsequent experiments was to determine
relative reaction velocity constants and equilibrium
quotients. However, experimental conditions imposed
thus far have been inadequate for these determinations.
As shown by Fig. 11.2, the reaction of fluoride ion with
BCl; has been essentially quantitative even at these low
concentrations. Thus the rate of chemical reaction has
been controlled by the rate at which BCl; was admitted
to the system. Values calculated for the equilibrium

the fluoride ion concentration in the melt diminished

experiments will be made in an attempt to determine

precisely the velocity and equilibrium constants for the .

exchange reaction.

The high rate of chemical recombination observed by
these experiments and the effectiveness of fluoride
removal are very favorable attributes of this proposed
chemical process. In addition chemical analyses of salt
samples have indicated that measurable corrosion of the

Chemical analyses also indicated that the boron content
of the melt, used repetitively, increased to about 200
ppm during initial . experiments and has remained
essentially constant at that value during the later
experiments. However, a spectrochemical method has
failed to detect boron concentrations above an analyt-
ical limit of 50 ppm. Although the differences in the
analytical methods have not been resolved, the presence
of this small boron concentration in the salt is not a
serious deterrent for the process. Elemental boron is
not wet by bismuth even at temperatures of 1500 to
1600°C.2 Its transport to the fluoride fuel should then
be limited to a salt entrainment condition and should
be a negligible process consideration.

11.2 DISTRIBUTION OF SODIUM AND POTASSIUM
IN THE METAL TRANSFER PROCESS AT 650°C

D.M. Richardson, J. H. Shaffer

The reductive extraction process for removing rare
earths from MSBR fuel solvent will also result in
transport of other fission products and impurities
among the many liquid phases of the extractor system.
It is important to determine where these elements
would become concentrated so that they could be
effectively removed and so that locations of possible
interaction with process efficiency can be identified.
Additional interest in the distributions of the alkali
metals arose from the possibility that some of them
might be used as diluents in the lithium chloride phase
of the system, thereby conserving "Li whenever it
became desirable to discard the chloride extractant. The
distributions of sodium and potassium for both the
fluoride/bismuth and chloride/bismuth extractions have
been measured at 650°C.

The four reductive extractions were performed in
4-in, IPS SS 304L vessels with mild steel liners. In each
vessel two ¥%, -in. steel pipes extended to within % in. of
the bottom and provided separately for adding lithium
directly to the metal phase and for withdrawing
bismuth samples in graphite dippers. Additional ports
were provided for material additions, salt sampling with
hydrogen-fired copper filter sticks, gas exhaust, and
thermocouples. In the fluoride/bismuth experiments
insulated ports for inserting beryllium electrodes were
also provided. Each vessel was charged with approxi-

mately 3000 g of bismuth and was hydrogen sparged
for 8 hr at 600°C.

The fluoride salts consisted of LiF-BeF,-ThF,
(72-16-12 mole %) to which NaF (labeled with several
millicuries of 22Na) or KF was added to make 1 mole
%. The salts were treated in nickel preparation vessels at
650°C according to standard hydrofluorination pro-
cedures, followed by hydrogen sparging, and approxi-
mately 3000 g were transferred at 650°C to the
extraction vessels under flowing argon.

The chloride salts consisted of LiCl to which NaCl
(also labeled with several millicuries of 22Na) or KCl
was added to make 1 mole %. The salts were sparged at
650°C for 8 hr with 50-50 vol % hydrogen—hydrogen
chloride at 1 liter/min. They were then hydrogen
sparged at 1 liter/min until the effluent gas contained
less than 0.02 meq HCI per liter hydrogen. Under
flowing argon, approximately 2000 g of these purified
mixtures were transferred to the extraction vessels at
650°C. ‘

Reductions were made by incremental additions of
0.5- or 1.0-g pieces of clean lithium metal directly to
the metal phases. Equilibration of the fluoride/bismuth
experiments was promoted by argon sparging at 1
liter/min for a minimum of 5 hr and until a beryllium
electrode temporarily inserted into the salt showed a
stabilized potential. Equilibration of the
chloride/bismuth experiments was promoted by over-
night sparging with argon at about 0.3 liter/min.

The analyses of lithium and the corrosion product
metals were performed by the Spectrochemical Labora-
tory. Analyses of potassium were made by the General
Analysis Laboratory. Analyses of sodium were made by
gamma-spectrometric counting of the 0.511-MeV anni-
hilation radiation of 22Na. Six days were allowed for
decay of thorium daughters in the bismuth pellet
samples, and fluoride salt activities were corrected for
thorium daughters by use of an identical fluoride
mixture without radiotracer sodium.

The results obtained are shown in Fig. 11.3 together
with the derived theoretical lines. In the
fluoride/bismuth experiments log Dy, = log Xp; +
1.225 and log Dy. = log X; ; + 1.045, where X| ; is the
mole fraction of lithium in bismuth; log (Dy,/D.) =
1.080, and log (Dg/D;;) = 0.899. The separation
factors, Dy/D ,,, for sodium and potassium from
72-16-12 fluoride were 30% to 70% smaller than the
separation factors for trivalent rare earths. In the
chloride/bismuth experiments log Dy, = log X;; —
0.164 and log Dy = log X; ; — 1.099; log (Dy ,/Dy;) =
—0.168, and log (Dg /Dy ;) = —1.104.

Material balances ‘were good for sodium in the
fluoride system and for potassium in both systems, as
well as could be determined. In the case of sodium in
the chloride/bismuth extraction there appeared to be
losses as the reductions proceeded, and 5% of the
sodium was unaccounted for at termination.

A difficulty encountered in all four experiments was
that the concentrations of corrosion ions (Cr, Ni, Mn)
were unusually high in the bismuth phase. This resulted
from the fact that the dip tubes that extended through
both salt and bismuth phases were constructed of
stainless steel. This was especially troublesome in the
fluoride/bismuth experiments, since both thorium and
nickel were lost from the bismuth solutions and the
apparent lithium metal utilization was about 20%.
Whether the distributions measured in the fluo-
ride/bismuth experiments were affected by this circum-
stance will require checking. It is not expected that any
effect would be found in the chloride/bismuth experi-
ments. These experiments served as a reminder that the
extractions into bismuth are sensitive to metal im-
purities, especially nickel,> and that methods for
control or removal of such impurities may be a
necessary part of the reductive extraction system.

At the first stage of the currently proposed metal
transfer process the fuel solvent mixture of fluorides is
contacted with bismuth, containing approximately
0.002 mole fraction lithium, which then contacts the
lithium chloride salt phase and is returned to the
fluoride extractor. In the second stage of the process
the lithjum chloride phase is next contacted with
bismuth containing approximately 0.05 mole fraction
lithium, The equilibrium distribution between a salt and
a bismuth phase for a metal with valence n is given by
the equilibrium quotient, QO,

respective mole fractions. The equilibrium distribution

bismuth phase is then

The calculated equilibrium distributions of sodium
and potassium in the metal transfer process at 650°C
are shown in Table 11.1 for the arbitrary case that the
impurity is 100 ppm (as the metal) in LiF-BeF,-ThF,
(72-16-12 mole %). It is apparent that these impurities
become most concentrated in the chloride phase, that
potassium is more completely extracted than sodium,
and that the rates of removal from the fluoride salt
would be relatively slow due to low concentrations in
the first bismuth phase.

The relative merits of, sodium and potassium as
diluents in the lithium chloride phase were compared,
arbitrarily, at the composition LiCl-MCl (60-40 mole
%). In the LiClI-NaCl system the melting point is

109

approximately S90°C.* In the LiCI-KCl system the
melting point is approximately 370°C.® The equilib-
rium concentration of sodium in the fluoride solvent
mixture (72-16-12 mole %) would be 2.71 mole %, and
that of potassium would be 0.477 mole %. Factoring
these calculated concentrations by the thermal neutron
cross section of 0.53 b for sodium and of 1.97 b for
potassium, the breeding penalty due to potassium
would be two-thirds as much as would result from
sodium.

11.3 REMOVAL OF LANTHANIDES FROM LITHIUM
CHLORIDES ON ZEOLITES

D. M. Moulton J. H. Shaffer

In the MSBR processing plant rare earths but not
thorium will be oxidized from the bismuth extractant
into lithium chloride. Any alkalies or alkaline earths
which are present in the bismuth will also be oxidized.
Since the LiCl must be chemically and isotopically
pure, occasional repurification will be required so that
it can be recycled. McNeese® has proposed a second
bismuth extraction with higher reductant concen-
trations. This would work best with the trivalent earths,
less well with divalent ones, and not at all with the
alkalies. We have explored a process which might be
considered as an alternative. This consists in exchanging
the impurity ions for lithium on a solid zeolite.

Zeolites are natural or synthetic aluminosilicates with
the formula MAIO, (SiO, ),,. They have an open cage

purities from LiCl. Zeolite ion exchange has been
studied more often in molten nitrates at around 330°C.
Liquornik and Marcus® found that strontium and
calcium are strongly absorbed at low concentrations in
NaNOj, but that the barium form of Zeolite A does not
exist.. Callahan® concluded that in LiNO; the zeolite
mineral chabazite preferentially absorbed large cations
and those of low valence. However, if a cation is too
large, as cesium is, it may not be able to squeeze
through the relatively narrow openings into the central
chamber of the zeolite; this shows up with Zeolite A
but not so much with chabazite, where the holes are a
little bigger.

Some of these results can be applied directly to our
problem. Platek and Marinsky’s work, for example, was
carried out under exactly the same conditions as we use
and shows that rubidium and cesium can be removed
from the chloride. The nitrate studies may be less
pertinent because of the temperature difference and the
fact that the anions also play a role in ion exchange,
since, according to Liquornik and Marcus, they enter
the zeolite structure as ion pairs. Their experiments
indicate that strontium, at least, may be removable, but
this has not been confirmed directly. The feasibility of
using zeolites may rest on the outcome of experiments
which we have initiated to establish their chemical and
physical stability in LiCl at 650°C. Zeolites are known
to undergo thermal degradation at temperatures in
excess of 700°C; they may, therefore, approach in-
stability under conditions which might foreseeably
occur in their application to fuel reprocessing. There

should be no chemical corrosion as long as the salt is
dry, since the composition of zeolite corresponds
essentially to that of glass, which contains chlorides
quite well. :

We have finished the first of a planned series of
experiments using zeolite to remove fission products
from LiCl. Lithium zeolite was prepared from Linde
Zeolite 4A by grinding zeolite pellets to <200 mesh and
soaking the powder in 13 M LiCl solution. Only about
half the sodium originally present was replaced by
lithium in this procedure. About 25 g of this material
was put into a steel pot and fired with Ar—10% H, at
350°C. Then 1.5 kg of LiCl containing 0.21 g of labeled
CeCl; was added at 650°C. Filter and dipper samples
were taken, the latter type under agitation so that some
solid could be gathered. The filtered samples showed
about 60% removal of the cerium, while the six solid
samples all showed increased activity. The highest had
nearly ten times as much cerium per gram as the
original salt, corresponding to 60 mg zeolite, Un-
fortunately, it was not possible to separate the zeolite
from the salt, so this concentration could not be
checked. A value of 330 was found for XK, assuming
that all the lost cerium was on the zeolite and that
cerium was trivalent.

The preliminary results obtained in the experiments

described above indicate that the zeolites are poten-
tially useful materials for the removal of rare earths
from lithium chloride. We are therefore continuing our
investigation of their potential application to fuel
reprocessing,

11.4 ZIRCONIUM PLATINIDE AS A REMOVAL
AGENT FOR RARE EARTHS

D.M. Moulton J. H. Shaffer

The possibility of precipitating zirconium platinide
from uranium-containing systems of bismuth and fluo-
ride salt has been described earlier.!® In that experi-
ment the platinum content was slightly less than
stoichiometric for the formation of ZrPt;. We now
report an experiment in which the platinum content
was varied, rising eventually to a substantial excess.

The experimental procedure was straightforward: 2.9
kg of LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) containing 32
g of uranium and 1.6 g of zirconium was extracted in an
all-graphite pot at 600°C into 3 kg of bismuth using
incremental lithium additions. Three extractions were

carried out in the same apparatus, separated by a
platinum addition and a hydrofluorination. The plati-
num contents were 4, 11, and 41 g, corresponding to
50, 110, and 410% of the zirconium equivalent. The
behavior of the uranium and zirconium is shown in Fig.
11.4.

In the first part of the experiment things behaved as
expected. The zirconium was extracted from the salt,
but only 15 to 20% appeared in the metal. The uranium
was also extracted, but its balance remained high (about
115% throughout). Half the platinum did not appear
with the first sample, and the deficit increased as the
experiment proceeded. This early loss cannot be ex-
plained by platinide precipitation, since both uranium
and zirconium were all in the salt and no reductant had
been added.

With the second platinum addition unexpected be-
havior occurred. Again the zirconium was removed, but
this time the uranium balance fell from 90 to 70%.

111

Both uranium and zirconium showed a balance mini-
mum a little before the end of the run; they were lost
from the salt before reappearing in the metal. This
coincided with a drop in platinum and a rise in thorium.
This behavior probably indicates that when the major
fractions of uranium and zirconium were reduced,
reduction of thorium began; then it displaced uranium
and zirconium from the platinide compound. Only
about 10% of the platinum ever appeared in the metal,
an amount too small to be explained by ZiPt;
precipitation in the early stages of the experiment.

After the last addition the pattern was similar except
that the minima were more pronounced, with uranium
falling below 20% balance. Again most of the platinum
was absent from the very beginning of the run, though
the bismuth phase concentration of all of the active
metals was below detectability and the deficit of
uranium and zirconium was not nearly enough to
account for the discrepancy.

We have assumed that the precipitate in this reaction
is ZrPty. A log-log plot of data for platinum vs the
other metals is widely scattered, but ZrPt; appears to
be more likely than any of the other reported species,
which begin with Zr,Pt;. The uranium and thorium
data are, however, fitted best if it is assumed that the
formulas of their platinides, respectively, are UPt, and
ThPt (or possibly ThPt,). These assignments must be
regarded as tentative until additional data are obtained.

112

In terms relevant to reprocessing, we draw the
following conclusions: First, the uranium-zirconium
separation is confirmed (first run). Second, at an excess
of platinum, uranium is also precipitated. Third, at a

high reductant concentration thorium platinide will’

displace the other two intermetallics. Thus if this
process is to be used in a plant it will be necessary to
control operating conditions carefully so that only
zirconium is removed.

12. Development and Evaluation of Analytical Methods

for Molten-Salt Reactors

12.1 SPECTRAL STUDIES OF MSRE
FUEL SAMPLES

J. P. Young

The three samples of MSRE fuel which were taken for
molten-salt spectral determination of the U(II)/U(IV)
ratio have all been examined. A description of the
sampling and spectral study procedures and a partial
discussion of the results which were obtained have been
given previously.! Samples of the MSRE fuel were
taken during the last power run of the reactor (run 20).
On the basis of material balance of reductant added to
the MSRE fuel, the following percent concentrations of
U(III) had been calculated for these samples:2 (1)
negligible U(IID), (2) 1.2% U(II), and (3) 2.9% U(III).
The samples were stored varying lengths of time for up
to two months at a temperature of >200°C until they
could be melted for study. The first two samples could
not be transferred without exposing the samples to the
atmosphere. The failure in both cases was the inability
to open a sealed, threaded plug immediately under the
sample container. These plugs were in a high radiation
field and heated for over a month at 250°C. The third
sample, same storage conditions, opened without prob-
lem and was successfully transferred without exposure
to air. The first two samples when melted under a
helium atmosphere were visibly turbid; the spectra of
the resultant melt showed no evidence of U(III) or
UV). It would appear that the dissolved uranium
obviously present in reactor fuel had come out of
solution in sampling, storage, or remelting of the sample
in the spectral furnace. The initial spectral study of the

last sample has been described.! The spectrum of U(IV)
was seen, but not that of U(III).

After the initial spectral measurements, experiments
were performed to attempt the radiolytic and chemical
generation of U(III) in this sample. The sample of
MSRE fuel was maintained at room temperaturé for
two periods of four days each and one period of six
days. At the end of each period the atmosphere around
the sample was evacuated and purged with helium
several times; this operation would also remove any
radiolytically generated F, that was present in the
sample. The sample was then melted for spectral study.
Each time an increase in ultraviolet absorbance of the
solution was noted which corresponds to an increase in
the U(III) concentration of 30 to 40 ppm per four-day
period. Based on estimates that the G factor for the
radiolytic formation of F, in the salt is approximately
0.02,> the amount of U(IIT) formed is about 10% of
that which could be generated if all the radiolytic F,
that formed had been removed from the sample. One
would not expect all of this radiolytic F, to leave the
sample environment, however, so the apparent increase
in U(III) concentration is reasonable. After this study a
small amount of uranium metal (~60 mg) was added to
the sample while exposed to the air. On remelting in an
atmosphere of helium, the color of the MSRE sample

- changed from light green to dark red within 5 min. The

113

resultant spectrum of U(II) was very intense; light was
only transmitted through those - wavelength ranges
where U(III) absorbs little or no light. The relatively

weak absorption peak for U(III) at 720 nm could be

observed, however. Again the sample was cooled, and a
crystal of FeF, (~3 mg) was added to the sample. After
flushing with helium, the sample was again melted. Due
to the generation of metallic iron by the U(III),

spectral traces were poor, but they did show the

reappearance of U(IV) within a period of 15 min.

Along with the chemical and radiolytic studies, visual
observation of the wetting behavior of the melt to its
nickel container could be made. Based on observations
made of the sample and container when the sample was
withdrawn at the MSRE, the salt was nonwetting, After
the possible radiolytic generation of U(IIL), the solid-
ified melt was still nonwetting to the container. After
the U® addition, the melt was wetting. The melt was
again nonwetting after the reaction with FeF,. These
observations on the radioactive salt are in line with the
wetting behavior that has been observed in nonradio-
active melts.* At the end of all the studies with this
~300-mg sample of MSRE fuel, the sample was reading
about 70 R at contact based on the in-cell radiation
monitor.

12.2 SPECTRAL STUDIES OF ACTINIDE IONS
IN MOLTEN FLUORIDE SALTS

J. P. Young

Now that the hot-cell spectrophotometric facility has
been installed,’ it is possible to spectrally study various
radioactive actinides in molten fluoride melts. Such

studies provide information about the chemical and

solution properties of these solute species, provide
analytical usefulness in helping to determine oxidation
state and/or concentration of these solute species, and
provide background information pertaining to spectral
studies of such radioactive molten salts. For spectral
measurements, the melts are contained in windowless
cells. The solutions are prepared by dissolving solute
salts in the solvent melt or by melting prepared samples
in the optical cells. These samples are contained in
14 -in.-diam copper tubing; these segments have been cut
from copper filter sticks after a sample has been
withdrawn into the filter stick and allowed to freeze.

In cooperation with C. Bamberger and R. G. Ross,’
who have furnished the copper tube samples, spectral
studies of Pa(IV) and Pu(lll) in LiF-BeF,-ThF,
(72-16-12 mole %) have been carried out. These spectral
studies of Pa(IV) appear to be the first spectral studies
of protactinium in molten salts. We have further

observed some weak absorption bands for Pa(IV) in the
region of 1.83 p (5460 cm™) which we have tenta-
tively assigned to f-f transitions of this ion. This is
apparently the first observation of these transitions for
Pa(IV) in a solution of any kind, although they have
been observed in crystalline solids. Besides the weak
absorption bands for Pa(IV) near 1.83 u (molar
absorptivity unknown), Pa(IV) exhibits two overlapping
strong absorption bands at 330 and 260 nm. The molar
absorptivity of the 330-nm band is the order of 600
liters mole™ cm™ at a temperature of ~570°C. With
this sensitivity Pa(IV) could be detected, spectrally, at a
concentration of <50 ppm in a 1-cm path length. The
ultraviolet spectrum of Pa(IV) compares favorably with
that seen for Pa(IV) in aqueous NH, F solutions.® The
spectrum we obtained for Pu(IIl) in molten LiF-BeF,-
ThF, is essentially the same that has been reported for
Pu(Ill) in aqueous solutions.” The spectral study of
Pu(IIl) in the molten fluoride salt was performed to see
if the presence of 0? in the solution affected the
coordination of Pu(IIl), for example, by formation of
PuO*. The spectrum of Pu(lll) in LiF-BeF,-ThF, in
the presence or absence of excess ThO, was identical.
This result indicates that the nature of the Pu(III)
soluble species was not affected by 0%.

Molar absorptivities of the many absorption peaks
seen in the wavelength range 300 nm to 2 u have not
yet been calculated, but they would all be less than 40
liters mole cm™ at 575°C. The spectrum of Pu(IIl)
exhibits many peaks, some of which could interfere
with spectral measurements of U(IV), U(III), or Pa(IV).
Computer resolution of the spectrum could be used to
minimize this interference.

" The spectrum of Cm(HI) has been obtained in molten
LiF-BeF,-ThF,. CmF; was prepared by the method of
Cunningham et al,® in which CmF; was precipitated
by HF addition to aqueous Cm(NO3); solution. The
air-dried precipitate was added to solid LiF-BeF,-ThF,,
and on melting, the spectrum of Cm(III) grew in. The
spectrum of Cm(IIl) is similar to that reported by
Carnall” for Cm(III) in aqueous solution; the molten
fluoride spectrum exhibits more detail than the spec-
trum seen by Carnall for Cm(III) dissolved in molten
nitrate media. Although the main Cm(III) absorption
peaks are in the ultraviolet region, a weak extraneous

peak was seen at 500 nm. Based on mass assay of the
starting material, it is likely that this peak arises from
an Am(IID) impurity in the curium.

12.3 REFERENCE ELECTRODE STUDIES
IN MOLTEN FLUORIDES

D.L. Manning F. L. Clayton®

Studies were continued on an Ni/NiF, reference
electrode which utilizes single-crystal LaF; as the ionic
conductor between the reference electrode compart-
ment and the melt being investigated.

An electrode was fabricated where the single-crystal
LaF; ionic conductor is in the form of a small cup
(crystal, % in. diam X % in. long, hole % in. diam X ¥
in. deep). With this configuration, the reference elec-
trode is comprised of a small nickel electrode that is
immersed in molten LiF-BeF,-ZrF, (NiF, saturated)
contained in the LaF; crystal. The crystal is enclosed in
a copper sheath, and contact with the melt is made
through a fine-porosity nickel frit as previously de-
scribed.'® The electrode was immersed in molten
LiF-BeF,-ZrF,, and emf measurements were made
between the reference electrode and a nickel electrode
immersed in the melt as known amounts of NiF, were
added to the melt. The nickel concentration at each
emf measurement was also determined by chemical
analysis. A plot of the emf values vs the log of the
nickel concentration gave a very good straight line with
the predicted Nernst slope. The reference electrode
exhibited good electrical characteristics, and the emf
values were stable and reproducible. It appears that this
form of the reference electrode with a fluoride melt
(saturated with NiF,) inside the LaF; crystal exhibits
better electrical response than the type in which the
Ni/NiF, is present as a solid phase in the form of a
pressed pellet. At melt saturation in NiF,, an emf of
~50 mV (reference positive) was still present. Although
this is somewhat closer to the theoretical zero emf than
was realized with the pellet-type electrode! ® in molten
LiF-BeF,-ZrF, at 500°C, it appears that we are still
confronted with a small unknown “junction” potential.

In another experiment the same type of reference
electrode was used to follow voltammetrically the
half-wave potential of the U(IV) - U(II) reduction
wave in molten LiF-BeF,-Z:F, (500°C) relative to the
Ni/NiF,(LaF;) reference as the U(IV)/U(III) ratio was

varied. Of interest here was to observe if the increase in
the concentration of U(III) (i.e., melt more reducing)
would have any adverse effect on the potential of the
reference electrode. The FE 12 of the U(Iv) - UI
reduction wave was constant at —1.352 + 0.024 V over
a period of 20 days. The U(IV)/U(III) ratio, adjusted
with zirconium metal, varied from >10,000:1 to
~10:1. It thus appears that the reducing potential of
the melt does not adversely affect the potential of the
reference. The experiment was discontinued because
electrical contact with the reference was lost. It
appeared as if the fine-porosity nickel frit had become
plugged. The reason for this is not apparent; however,
we do plan for future electrodes to increase the
porosity of the nickel frits from ~1 to ~10 pu pore size.

The E, , of the U(IV) = U(III) reduction wave is the
voltammetric equivalent of the standard electrode
potential (E°) of the U(IV)/U(III) reference vs the
Ni/NiF, reference. A value of —1.35 V at 500°C was
calculated from the equation AF = —nFE® and the free
energy of formation of UF,, UF,, and NiF,.!! The
measured E° of the U(IV)/U(III) couple vs Ni/NiF, is
in good agreement with the predicted value, although
the measured result was not corrected for any “junc-
tion” potential.

We are continuing the experiments to observe the
stability of the electrode over longer periods of time
and to better understand and control the small extrane-
ous potentials observed in the LiF-BeF,-ZrF,; melts.

platinum and pyrolytic graphite electrodes for the
potential step integral data. In order to compare the
results obtained from the two methods relative to the
same electrode material (nickel), the potential step
integral experiments were repeated at a nickel elec-
trode. The potential step data obtained in molten
LiF-BeF,-ZrF, were also reevaluated after fitting the
experimental lines to the data points by the method of
least squares. Average values.obtained for the apparent
k and for a utilizing the voltage step method and the
potential step integral method are ~2 X 1072 and 4 X
107% cm/sec and 0.34 and 0.43 respectively. The
measurements of k and «a by the two methods are in
reasonable agreement. A rate constant in the range
determined for the nickel/nickel(II) couple in this study
(2 to 4 X 107% cm/sec) may be considered to
correspond to a reversible (or quasi-reversible) process,
although it is considerably lower than the rate constant
of ~0.1 cm/sec reported for the same couple in
LiCl-KCl at 450°C.'

12.5 ANALYTICAL STUDIES OF NaBF,

COOLANT SALT
R.F. Apple J.M. Dale
L.J.Brady A.S. Meyer

The proposed use of NaBF, eutectic as a coolant for
the MSBR has introduced a number of new analytical
problems. Those problems associated with the analysis
of the salt have largely been handled by refinements in
the analytical procedures that have been made over an
extended period during service analyses of samples.
Analytical studies of the cover gas have included on-site
attempts to identify and measure certain objectionable
contaminants in the off-gas. An effort is being made to
extend this latter work to the study of methods for the
removal of such contaminants from the cover gas and
the recovery of its constituents for recycling.

Analysis of NaBF,. — A method has been developed

* for the direct titration of the excess NaF in the eutectic

coolant. The method depends on the fact that the BF,™
ion is hydrolyzed very slowly in cold water.!” Imme-

. diately after dissolution of the samples, therefore, the

fluoride ion in solution comes almost entirely from the
excess NaF in the salt. A titration with thorium nitrate
solution made immediately after sample dissolution

corresponds to the free fluoride in the sample. This
method will be valuable because an elemental analysis
of the salt is a very insensitive index to the F~/BF,”
ratios. The method has been checked by standard
addition of NaF to NaBF, but has not yet been applied
to samples.

Several questions have been raised by the apparently
anomalous relationship between the water content of
NaBF, samples and the observed corrosion rates in
loops operated by the Metals and Ceramics Division." ®
Water in the salt samples is normally determined by the
Karl Fischer titration. Stoichiometric reaction of this
reagent with various compounds containing boron and
oxygen has been reported,'® each oxygen atom con-
suming reagent equivalent to that of a water molecule.
Essentially identical water titrations? obtained after
the water is separated by azeotropic distillation with
pyridine have provided supporting evidence that the
titrations represent water in the salts, or at least
compounds that are converted to water at the tempera-
ture of boiling pyridine (~115°C). Also, B,0; was
found to titrate equivalent to three waters per mole,
but an azeotropic distillation of B,0; yielded no
titratable water.?®

Cantor’! has suggested that since pyridine would be
expected to form strong addition compounds with BF;
and possibly other constituents of the salt, some
volatile addition compound might be contributing to
the titration obtained in the azeotropic distillations. In
order to test this, benzene, a less favorable distillation
medium but which offers little possibility of complex
formation, was substituted for pyridine. Although the
results were scattered, they overlapped the range
obtained with the pyridine distillation. It should be
noted, however, that these measurements were made on
a highly purified sample of NaBF,, and tests should
also be run on more contaminated samples.

Analysis of Coolant Cover Gas. — Certain modifica-
tions in the off-gas system of the NaBF, Circulating
Test Loop were made to study the role of contaminants
in the off-gas from the coolant salt system. These
changes, made by Gallaher,>? included a weighable
ice-cooled trap and a porous metal filter for the

collection of particulate matter. Of particular interest in
these studies was to measure the concentration of the
corrosive liquid which has been found to deposit in the
off-gas system and to determine whether such measure-
ments could be used to detect steam leaks into the
coolant salt. Analysis of the salt particles collected on
the filter revealed that their composition was the same
as that in the loop. An infrared spectrum of a sample of
the dark oily material showed heavily bonded OH bands
as well as structures such as B—F, C—F, and Si-O.

A Karl Fischer titration of a 100-cc/min sample taken
upstream of the traps did not increase upon addition of
10 g of water to the loop, although it had been
estimated that “H,0” concentrations equivalent to
several times the background titration would be ex-
pected. During the period after the water addition,
approximately 3 g of the liquid contaminant was
collected in the ice trap. The material showed some
tendency to reflux under heating but could not be
distilled conveniently from the trap because of its
design. The material was transferred to a titration vessel
with anhydrous methanol and found to consume titrant
equivalent to 800 mg of water. This quantity of water
in 3 g of the oily liquid corresponds to a composition of
an approximately equimolar mixture of BF;-H,0 and
BF;-2H,0, in general agreement with the earlier
postulation as to the compostion of such contaminants
as contaminated BF; hydrates.?®

To simulate the water injection experiment, a gas
train was set up in which mixtures of BF; and helium
could be passed through a fluorothene trap containing a
few milliliters of water. The effluent from the trap was
titrated with the Karl Fischer reagent. As the purging
continued the liquid in the trap increased in volume and
became more viscous. During this saturation period the
titration rate dropped and approached the background
titration. The trap and connecting lines were then
placed in an oven and gradually heated. A perceptible
titration was noted when the trap temperature reached
about 50°C and rose rapidly to exceed the titration rate
of the apparatus (~30,000 ppm) at about 100°C. This
would appear to explain the lack of titrations at the
Pump Loop, as there were relatively cool regions of the
off-gas system upstream of the sampling point. The
deposition of the fluid at points downstream is not
completely explained, but it may have been transported
as aerosol particles.

We are attempting to use the apparatus to study
methods of recovery of BF; and helium from the

coolant off-gas for recycle to the pump seal purge
system and sparge lines. The first step of such a process
would be a trapping system that would remove these
impurities from the off-gas. We have tested several
molecular sieves and found them to be less than 100%
effective within the 50 to 90°C temperature range
required to maintain the hydrates in the vapor state.
The present apparatus is rather difficult to use; we are,
therefore, reconditioning a corrosive gas chromatograph
that is equipped with a gas density detector to provide a
more efficient means of screening potential adsorbents.
This chromatograph will also be used to test some BF,
adsorbents suggested by Kohn.?!

In an allied study an apparatus has been assembled to
measure BF; as it is stripped from saturated fluoride
salts by sparging with helium. The apparatus is being
used to assist in BF; solubility studies being made by
Ward and Cantor.2! At present it has been used only in
a qualitative mode to observe when stripping is com-
plete (~5 hr from LiF-BeF, melts), but it is expected
to provide a quantitative measure of the total BF,
removed and replace the less convenient absorption
techniques now in use.

The apparatus utilizes a nickel-filament thermal con-
ductivity (TC) cell and includes a Teflon plug gas
chromatographic valve which can direct flows for
restandardization of the TC cell with only momentary
disruption of the stripping gas. Also included is a
dynamic dilution system which provides standardizing
gas mixtures of from 0 to 100% BF;. This system will
be available to calibrate other TC assemblies.

Because of its chemical reactivity the accurate meas-
urement of small BF; flows has been a problem. In the
past we have approximated its flow from measurements
of the time required for the pressure of BF; in an
isolated volume upstream of the controlling capillary to
decay by a small increment. These times are compared
with those observed when the same system is pres-
surized with helium, a gas whose flow can be accurately
measured with a soap film flow meter. Because the
viscosities of these two gases are very similar, this
technique appeared adequate.

The technique was attempted on the present system
using a precision pressure gage (Heiss, model H50743,
0—1000 mm). When some difficulties were experienced
in establishing a TC calibration curve, an equation was
derived to relate the time required for an incremental
pressure drop, the upstream volume, and the viscosity
of the gas flowing through the capillary. Measurements
were made over the pressure range used, 150 to 1000
mm gage. The technique was tested using H, as an
unknown with helium as a calibrating gas, and excellent

 
 

 

 

reproducibility was obtained. The technique would
appear to be generally applicable to corrosive gases.

The flow of BF; through capillaries was found to
deviate markedly from that predicted by the Poiseulle
law. This is surprising since the P-V-T relationships of
BF;3%* approach the ideal gas law at the conditions of
these measurements, and the Reynolds number at
maximum flow is less than 1000. Ideally, the flow of
gas corresponds to the formula

F=k(P2 -P3),

where P;, and Py are the pressures upstream and
downstream of the capillary and k involves capillary
dimensions, fundamental constants, and the viscosity of
the gas being measured. We find that the usual
noncondensable gases conform to this formula within
our precision of measurement. For BF, however, the
~ value of k was found to decrease by as much as 20%
with upstream pressure ranges from 150 to 1000 mm.
The variation is linear with gage pressure, and its
magnitude varies with the dimensions of the capillary.
Extrapolated values of k are in reasonable agreement
with viscosities reported for BF; measured at near
atmospheric pressure.?S To eliminate the possibility

that these data result from adsorption in the upstream
portions of the apparatus the effluent BF; was meas-
ured by displacement over mercury. These measure-
ments confirmed the pressure-time calculations.
Using the experimentally derived k values to calculate
composition, a reasonable TC vs composition curve was
obtained with small positive deviations from additive
thermal conductivities. The above phenomenon on
capillary flow will be investigated further, as time
permits, because it might be of importance in future
experiments with coolant cover gases.

12.6 IN-LINE CHEMICAL ANALYSES
J. M. Dale

The PDP-8/I digital computer purchased for applica-
tion to inline analytical methods for molten salts was
received by the Reactor Projects Group. It is planned to
make the first application of the computer to the
control of voltammetric determinations of UIV)/U(III),
ratios in simulated MSRE fuel salt in a thermal
convection loop. This project will be carried out in:

cooperation with members of the Metals and Ceramics’
Division who designed and are in the process of

constructing the salt loop. A new more. versatile
voltammeter is also being fabricated for use- on this
project. Besides providing information on the effect of
U(III) concentrations on fuel salt characteristics, this
project will allow practical knowledge to be obtained
for application to automated in-line analyses of fuel
salts by other analytical techniques.

Part 4. Materials Development

vd

J. R. Weir, Jr.

Our materials program has concentrated on the
development of graphite and Hastelloy N with im-
proved resistance to irradiation damage. We have
approached the graphite problem by studying the
dimensional changes during irradiation of several com-
mercial graphites. These studies have revealed which
graphites are most stable and, additionally, have shown
what preirradiation properties are important in making
some experimental graphites that likely will have
improved dimensional stability during irradiation. The
graphite used in an MSBR must also be sealed to reduce
the permeability to gaseous fission products. We are
developing techniques for sealing graphite with carbon.
+ The fast flux seen by the Hastelloy N is quite low,
and the irradiation damage to this material is associated
with the production of helium from the transmutation
of '°B by thermal neutrons. The threshold boron level
required to cause embrittlement is too low to be
obtained commercially, so we sought to reduce the
problem by changes in alloy chemistry. Modified
compositions of Hastelloy N containing additions of Ti,
Hf, and Nb look promising. The improved properties
are associated with the formation of a fine dispersion of

type MC carbides, and we are studying how the carbide
type changes with alloy composition and aging.

The compatibility of Hastelloy N with fluoride salts
continues to receive attention; the main emphasis is
currently placed on the proposed coolant salt, sodium
fluoroborate. This salt is more corrosive than other
fluoride salts; we attribute this aggressiveness to the
presence of adsorbed moisture. The variation of cor-
rosion rate with moisture content and methods of
removing moisture from a flowing salt stream are being
studied.

Some work has begun on developing structural
materials suitable for use in the chemical processing
plant. In this application the materials will be exposed
to both salt and bismuth. Nickel-base alloys are highly
soluble-in bismuth, and iron-base alloys mass transfer
very badly. Molybdenum seems compatible, but it is
difficult to fabricate. One avenue of research involves
methods of coating steels with molybdenum or tung-
sten to protect them from bismuth. A second area of
endeavor is that of finding brazing alloys that are
compatible with bismuth for joining molybdenum.

13. Examination of MSRE Components

H. E. McCoy

Operation of the MSRE has been terminated after
successfully completing its mission. Some additional
information can be gained by examining selected parts
of the reactor. This examination to date has been
limited to the coolant circuit; work on the radioactive
part of the system will begin in the near future. The

coolant circuit has circulated LiF-BeF, salt for 26,000

119

hr. When the system was at full power, the inlet
temperature of the salt to the radiator was 590°C and
the outlet temperature was 538°C. These were the
conditions for about half of the operation. At low
power the system was isothermal at about 650°C. Salt
analyses had shown that the chromium concentration
remained about constant at 32 £ 7 ppm, indicating little

 
 

 

 

 

corrosion. We examined tubing from the inlet and
outlet ends of the radiator and thermocouple wells
from the inlet and outlet lines to the radiator.

13.1 EXAMINATION OF TUBING FROM THE
MSRE RADIATOR

H.E.McCoy B. McNabb

Samples of the %-in.-OD X 0.072-in.-wall tubing
from the MSRE radiator were removed from the inlet
and outlet ends for examination. The insides of the
tubes had been exposed to flowing LiF-BeF, (64-36
mole %) for about 26,000 hr. During about half of this
time the whole radiator operated isothermally at
650°C, and during the other half the salt inlet tempera-
ture was 593°C and the outlet temperature was 538°C.

We first examined the tubes visually and found them
to be very clean and free of any deposits of metal or
salt.

The tubing was produced by Wall Tube and Metal
Products Company, Newport, Tennessee, to specifi-
cations MET-RM-B-163, MET-NDT-3, and MET-
NDT-165. The heat number was 5097, and the certified
chemical composition was Ni—16.2% Mo-7.0% Cr—
4.2% Fe—0.62% Si—0.47% Mn, 0.20% W, 0.33% V,
0.18% Co, 0.06% C, 0.001% P, 0.01% S, 0.02% Al + Ti,
0.01% Cu, 0.002% B. The material was annealed
following fabrication to some unspecified temperature,
likely in the range of 1000 to 1200°C. Typical
photomicrographs of the as-received tubing are shown
in Fig. 13.1. The relatively fine grain size of the
material and the carbide stringers in the primary
working direction are evident in Fig. 13.le. Figure
13.1b shows a typical high-magnification view of the
carbide stringers in the as-polished condition. The
carbides are quite brittle, and they fracture during
fabrication to produce cracks a few tenths of a mil long.
An etched view of the inside edge is shown in Fig.
13.1c. The etchant attacked the carbides readily,
causing them to fall out and to leave holes. A typical
etched cross-sectional view is shown in Fig. 13.1d. The
stringers are not apparent since they are being viewed
from the ends.

The microstructure of the tubing was altered two
ways during service. The outside of the tubing was
oxidized, and the inside of the tubing etched more
rapidly to a depth of about 5 mils. These changes are
shown in Fig. 13.2 for tubing at the inlet end and in
Fig. 13.3 for the outlet end. The oxidation is not
excessive, and the penetration of the oxide front is
typical for nickel alloys with chromium as low as

120

Hastelloy N. The tubing at the outlet end of the
radiator was very similar (Fig. 13.3).

We investigated further the difference in etching
characteristics near the inside surface of the tubing. A
less aggressive electrolytic etchant was used to delineate
the carbide structure better. The as-received material is
shown in Fig. 13.4. There is still some attack of the
primary carbide stringers, but very few fine carbides are
present. The tubing from the inlet end of the heat
exchanger is shown in Fig. 13.5. Fine carbides are
present throughout the material. They are concentrated
along the grain boundaries and are even more concen-
trated near the surface. The tubing from the outlet end
looked very similar. Thus the long time in service
caused carbides to precipitate throughout the material,
particularly near the inside surface.

In further pursuit of the different etching character-
istics near the surface, we examined the samples with
the electron microprobe analyzer. No compositional
variations in Cr, Mo, Ni, or Fe were observable to
within 2 p of the surface (the allowable working range
on these samples). The lubricants that are used in
drawing tubing are often high in silicon or carbon, but
the concentrations of these elements were too low for
the electron microprobe analyzer. We machined turn-
ings from the tube for analysis for these elements, and
the results are given in Table 13.1. The analysis shows a
higher carbon concentration at the inside surface, a fact
that should lead to increased carbide precipitation. The
carbon would be dissolved by the post-fabrication
anneal and reprecipitate during service.

We ran a tensile test on a piece of pipe from the
outlet end and a piece of as-received tubing from the
same lot (heat 5101). The properties are given in Table
13.2. The only significant property change is the
fracture strain and the reduction area. However, these
changes are rather modest and do not indicate a serious
embrittlement of the material.

13.2 EXAMINATION OF THERMOCOUPLE WELLS
FROM THE MSRE COOLANT CIRCUIT

H.E.McCoy B. McNabb

Two thermocouple wells from the inlet and outlet
5-in. coolant lines to the radiator were removed and
examined. The inlet well after it was removed by
cutting with a coated welding electrode is shown in Fig.
13.6. The oxidized appearance and the metal fragments
on the part arose from the cutting operation. The
geometry of the well can be described with the aid of
Fig. 13.6. The circular piece of material is part of the
5-in. pipe wall. The thermocouple well was machined
from bar stock so that it extended about 3 in. into the
flowing salt stream. The well was machined with a

 

126

INCHES

protrusion that was to be field ground and welded to
the 5-in. pipe. The cross-sectional view of part of the
inlet well in Fig. 13.7 makes the geometry more
evident. The pipe wall, the welds, and the thermocouple
well are evident.

Metallographic examination of the mounted cross
section shown in Fig. 13.7 revealed that the weld had
cracked on the salt side of the pipe. The cracks on both
of the polished surfaces in Fig. 13.7 are shown in Fig.
13.8. In the worst case the cracks penetrate to a depth
of about 3 mils. The remaining half of the well was
cleaned by acid etching to remove the metal from the
cutting operation, and the weld was checked with dye
penetrant. A photograph of the weld with dye still
present is shown in Fig. 13.9. Note that the crack as
indicated by the dark color extends almost completely
around the weld. There is also an area where complete
penetration of the root pass did not occur. We propose
that the cracks formed as the weld was made due to the
poor fitup of the parts to be welded. The welds were
not stress relieved, and the fact that the cracks did not
penetrate further attests to the lack of stress and crevice
corrosion in lithium—beryllium fluoride salts.

We did not section the outlet well, but we did clean
the weld and examine it with dye penetrant. No cracks
were observed.

discoloration and the fragments of metal resulted from cutting the part out with a coated welding electrode.

&e
 

ha

The outside surface of the 5-in. pipe was exposed to
air and was oxidized. Figure 13.10 shows the spotty
nature of the oxide and the fact that it has a maximum
thickness of about 3 mils.

A cross section from the bottom of the well was
examined. A macroscopic view of this section is shown
in Fig. 13.11. The inside of the well was prepared by
drilling, and the pointed shape of the drill is still
apparent at the bottom. The weld metal deposit on the
bottom was made to ensure that salt did not leak along
the carbide stringers. The amount of oxidation at the
bottom of the well was greater than that further up the
well. The transition to the thinner oxide about ' in.
from the bottom is apparent in Fig. 13.11. Figure
13.122 shows the oxide layer of about 5 mils at the
bottom of the well, and Fig. 13.12b shows the abrupt
transition that took place about ‘4 in. from the

 

127

bottom. We suggest that this difference may have been
due to the bottom of the well not being as clean as the
sides. Some lubricant would have been used during the
drilling.

A further significant observation was that the surfaces
of the well exposed to the salt looked quite similar to
those of surveillance samples removed from the MSRE!
(Fig. 13.13). We have previously attributed this modi-
fied surface structure to cold working from machining
and have shown that it can be produced in the absence
of salt. The structure likely results from carbides
forming on the slip bands produced by machining. Thus
there is no evidence of corrosion of this part.

14. Graphite Studies

W. P. Eatherly

The purpose of the graphite studies is to develop
improved ‘graphite suitable for use in molten-salt re-
actors. The graphite in these reactors will be exposed to
- high neutron fluences and must maintain reasonable
dimensional stability and mechanical integrity. Further-
more, the graphite must have a fine pore texture that
will exclude not only the molten salt but also gaseous
fission products, notably * 3% Xe.

Additional materials supplied by vendors or fabri-
cated at ORNL continue to be initiated into the
evaluation program. Several of these materials are being
irradiated in order to develop further information on
damage mechanism as it depends on raw materials.
Other samples are being investigated because of micro-
structural similarities to the most damage-resistant
materials heretofore irradiated. In addition, studies have
been initiated on the chemistry of raw materials and
their carbonization aimed at establishing a better basis
for the fabrication studies.

A second new program recently initiated is the
investigation of thermal conductivity changes due to
irradiation, Because the rate of damage is a function of
temperature in the higher ranges expected in molten-
salt reactors, changes in thermal conductance can lead
to increased graphite temperatures and possibly en-
hanced damage rates. Samples have been prepared for

preirradiation measurements, and irradiations are.

planned in early 1971,

Results on irradiated base structures and pyrolytically
impregnated structures continue to indicate a steady
deterioration in permeability and imply the generation
of new pore structures. This is to say, regardless of
changes occurring in the original pore structure, there is
an opening up of new pores induced by radiation
damage. Conversely, pyrolytically coated samples (as
distinct from pyrolytically impregnated samples) con-
tinue to look very promising, at least up to fluences of
1.6 X 10?2 neutrons/cm?® (E > 50 keV), the maximum
to which they have been exposed.

14.1 PROCUREMENT OF NEW GRADES
OF GRAPHITE .

W. H. Cook

We have continued our procurement of different

grades of graphite in our effort to obtain those most

resistant to neutron radiation damage and those that
will extend our knowledge about the behavior of
graphite in neutron irradiation. All materials specifically
sought by us or submitted to us by graphite producers
(governmental, universities, or commercial) are given
initial evaluation tests to determine if they justify
extensive evaluation. As our work progresses, the
number of samples that constitute untested grades of
graphite steadily decreases.

We recently acquired eight additional grades of
graphite that are being given initial evaluations. These
are grades VQMB,! GCMB,! TS-995,! P-03,> HS-82,
H413,> H414,® H415,2 and 1076.2 Grades VQMB and
GCMB, which are pitch-coke-based and Gilsonite-coke-
based materials, respectively, will not be included in our
irradiation program because we already have data on
these types of graphites. Grade TS-995 is a high-strain-
to-fracture type of graphite. Grades P-03 and 1076 are
near isotropic grades. Grade HS-82 is a high-strength
graphite supplied by Stackpole Carbon Company.
Grades H413, H414, and H415 are mesophase types.

To acquire the most irradiation-resistant grade of

new binders that are being developed, it is necessary
that reference fillers be used. Toward this end we have
begun to acquire some filler materials. We now have
Robinson (Air-Blown) coke,! graphitized Robinson
(Air-Blown) coke,! grade JOZ graphite flour,’ Santa
Maria coke, PXE-5Q1S,° and PXA-5Q1S.° Initial
fabrication studies with a conventional coal tar pitch
and the graphitized Robinson coke, the JOZ graphite
flour, and the Santa Maria coke have been reported.
Work is planned with the ungraphitized Robinson coke,
grade PXE-5Q1S, and grade PXA-5Q1S, all of which
approach being isotropic filler materials. Grade JOZ was
obtained by crushing and grinding fabricated bodies of
grade JOZ graphite.

14.2 GENERAL PHYSICAL PROPERTY
MEASUREMENTS

W. H. Cook

We are in the initial stages of determining the physical
properties of pitch-bonded lampblack materials, grades
$20, L31, and SA-45, and graphite grades HS-82, 1076,
P-03, TS-995, H-413, H414, and H415 described
previously. Average bulk (apparent) densities, electrical
resistance values, and microstructure observations are
summarized in Table 14.1. The lampblack-based ma-
terials have low bulk densities, but their irradiation
stabilities at low fluences have been surprisingly good.
The initial irradiation data on these are given by C. R.
Kennedy in Sect. 14.7. The resistivity values for the
various graphite grades are typical for these fine-
grained, near-isotropic materials.

The maximum mean filler size used in graphites listed
in Table 14.1 appeared to be approximately 5 mils,
except for the mesophase grades H-413, H414, and

135

H-415, which appeared to be at least twice as large.

None of these have pore entrance diameters approach-
ing the desired 1 ¢ or less sought for MSR graphite.
Therefore, the pore entrance diameters would have to
be decreased for any that showed potential in other
properties.

The most interesting and encouraging aspect of the
microstructures of the latest graphites received is their
strong similarity to those for grades AXF-5Q7 and H337

Essentially the same as grade AXF,

or H364, which have shown the greatest resistance to
neutron damage. Additional evaluations will determine
if the potential suggested by the microstructures is
warranted.

14.3 GRAPHITE FABRICATION: CHEMISTRY
R. A. Strehlow

Irradiation results to date suggest that graphite with
improved radiation damage resistance will be one of
four types:

1. isotropic graphite with large crystallite size,
2. isotropic graphite with uniform crystallite size,
3. “binderless” graphite,

4. “grainless” isotropic graphite (presumably of very
small crystallite size).

It is anticipated that one or all of these rather general
types of structure should offer a distinct increase in
radiation life. The chemistry studies are directed toward
developing the necessary chemical knowledge to fabri-
cate well-characterized samples of these four sorts of
graphite for testing purposes.

Graphite is made normally from organic compounds
by polymerization and thermal decomposition followed
by high-temperature heat treatment. The structure of
the product is a relic of those polymeric aggregates
formed early in the process. Graphite is customarily
made from three general types of carbon precursors:
petroleum coke, coal tar pitch, and gas-furnace carbon
blacks.

A twofold approach has been taken to find out to
what extent petroleum tars or coal tar pitch can be
carbonized to yield the essential isotropy. The first step
is to develop new and appropriate characterization
techniques. The second is to determine the extent to
which carbon structures can be controlled by chemical
means. A study of the applicability of high-temperature
centrifugation has been conducted which was intended
to approach these two goals simultaneously. Samples of
about 1.g size of three commercial pitches were
centrifuged in nickel crucibles at temperatures of up to
525°C and for times of up to 6 hr. The samples were
examined metallographically after longitudinal section-
ing of the capsules. A sample low-softening-point pitch
(grade 15V of Allied Chemical Corporation) is shown in
Fig. 14.1 after a 1-hr centrifugation at 425°C. Material
at the bottom of the capsule which apparently had not
dissolved at 425°C was present in an amount of perhaps
5 to 8%. On top of this “insoluble” was found a thin
layer of anistropic material. On top of the thin layer,

 

 
 

 

the glassy pitch mixture was basically featureless except
for a few artifacts probably due to shrinkage. Closer
examination of the thin layer was made and is shown in
Fig. 14.2. This shows the now well-known spheres of
“mesophase,” or liquid crystal material, formed from
the melt and in the process of coalescing into a
semicarbon, semiliquid material. Over this 1-hr period,
flow and reaction had evidently occurred leading to a

136

more highly reticulated set of interference patterns
under polarized light.

A sample of a medium-melting pitch (type 30M,
Allied Chemical Corporation) was centrifuged and
appeared to be quite similar except for the presence of
a much greater amount of “insoluble” material, perhaps
18 to 20% by volume. The coalesced mesophase was
quite similar to that observed for the softer 15V pitch.

High-temperature pitch (type 350HR, Allied Chemical
Corporation) was found, rather surprisingly, to contain
very little more insolubles at 425°C than the medium
30M pitch showed. This was unexpected, since the
standard chemical solubility tests for benzene-insoluble
components are generally present in greater amounts as
the softening range of the pitch increases, and one
might anticipate a parallel increase of high molecular
species which presumably dominate the insoluble
species found in this study. An added distinction for
the high-temperature material was that eight or nine
times as much coalesced material was found as in the
medium- or low-temperature pitches. This is shown in

Fig. 14.3.

Centrifugation for 6 hr at 425°C produced the sample
shown in Fig. 144. Here and in the higher-
magnification micrograph, Fig. 14.5, one can see a
structure of insoluble-free mesophase which suggests
the hour-by-hour history of pitch coke formation. After
formation and settling of the small spheres of sizes up
to a 20 diameter, coalescence is followed by a
continued gas evolution which slowly causes contrac-
tion, flow, and an increase in mesophase viscosity. A
bubble is seen rising in the now well-ordered carbon.
This material would be a precursor of highly anisotropic
graphite. The conclusion seems unavoidable that for
MSR use where isotropy is crucial, flow of the type
evidenced in these samples must be avoided.

Two samples of pitch 30M and 350HT were heated to
530°C and cooled at about 200°/hr. The samples in
Figs. 14.6 and 14.7 show that the amount of insoluble
fraction is comparable in each of these. Both of the
coalesced mesophase samples had flowed extensively.
The difference in gas bubble shape is probably due to
an intrinsic difference in viscosity, although a slight
difference in thermal history may be a factor.

Whether fluidized bed polymerization and decomposi-
tion techniques can be used in developing new isotropic
cokes or whether techniques of increasing the viscosity

of coalesced material still more than shown in the
high-temperature pitch case would be beneficial remains
to be determined. In the limit, of course, increase of
viscosity would yield a material which approaches the
character of thermosetting resins. These have been of
great value in specialty carbon manufacture.

Parallel to the study of the complex carbon precur-
sors a study of model compound carbonization has
been conducted for the two reasons of developing
better analytical techniques and to attempt carboniza-
tions of the most highly characterized materials pos-
sible. Model compound carbonization has been used to
simulate the polymerization-decomposition routes of
the more usual graphite precursors. A question of the
route of carbonization of a frequently used model
compound, acenaphthylene, was studied using thin-
layer separations of tars formed by pyrolysis of poly-
acenaphthylene. :

Polyacenaphthylene was prepared by thermal polym-
erization in air and subjected to inert-atmosphere

carbonization in a temperature gradient furnace. The
material was found to “pitchify” rapidly above a
temperature of 340°C (which thermogravimetry had
shown to be the temperature of rapid weight loss). The
pitches made in the temperature range from 345 to

355°C and 380 to 390°C were subjected to thin-layer
chromatographic analysis. It was found in this work

that the carbonization proceeds dominantly through
the dehydrogenated cyclic trimer decacyclene. Three
conflicting earlier studies®™.° can be rationalized in
terms of the carbonization conditions, as follows:

The work of Singer and Lewis® was conducted in

‘of a dimeric intermediate is not inconsistent with the

work of Fitzer and Muller,!® who examined, as we did,
the nonvolatile residue of a bulk pyrolysis, and who
obtained the oxidized cyclic trimer decacyclene. The
work of Sharkey et al.’ was directed toward the
determination of volatile components which were
formed. Their finding of acenaphthene agrees with our
findings for the volatile material. Such work on model
compounds is necessary if highly pedigreed materials
are to be fabricated for test and is broadly useful in the
difficult work of characterizing the more complex

14.4 MEASUREMENT OF THE THERMAL
CONDUCTIVITY OF GRAPHITE

J.P. Moore  D. L. McElroy

Tests of the previously described’! guarded linear
heat flow apparatus were completed to the design limit
of 700°C using Armco iron as a thermal conductivity
standard. The percentage deviation of each thermal
conductivity measurement from the assumed value for
the standard is shown in Fig. 14.8 vs temperature. The
upper line represents the results assuming linear heat
flow in the longitudinal system. The results are im-
proved substantially by calculating corrections for
radial heat flow between the guard cylinder and
specimen as shown by the dashed line. The data, as
corrected for radial heat exchange, are within +1.2% of
the standard value; since there could be an uncertainty
of +1.5% in the standard sample, the agreement is
considered excellent.

Specimens of H337 and Poco AXF graphite are in
hand for preirradiation measurements. Following these
measurements the specimens will be irradiated in HFIR
to various fluences from 550 to 700°C to evaluate the
effects of irradiation and postirradiation annealing on
thermal conductivity.

and extruded AXF (Y586) has essentially the same R
parameters as those previously reported for AXF (R =
0.673, R, = 0.663).

In addition to the anisotropy determinations, we are
analyzing the Bragg diffraction maxima to more ac-
curately determine the lattice parameters, crystallite
size, and percent of less-graphitic material. After
applying all the necessary corrections to the diffraction
data, the peaks arising from the (00) diffraction always
have a long low-angle tail. The length and intensity of
this tail is caused by the presence of less-graphitic
material in the sample. We have assumed that the
high-angle side of the diffraction maxima is representa-
 

 

 

tive of the peak shape obtained from the more-graphitic
material. By using this assumption and unfolding a
symmetrical peak about the maxima, the peak is
separated into two portions, as shown in Fig. 14.9. The
ratio of the integrated intensities of the low-angle
contribution to the composite peak is directly propor-
tional to the amount of less-graphitic carbon present.
The average interplanar spacing of this material is also
determined from the peak position. A summary of
results obtained on four grades of Poco graphite by
this technique is shown in Table 14.3. The lattice
parameter (c¢) of the more-graphitic material is slightly
less than that reported previously for the composite’ *
and is due to the corrections and unfolding applied to
the peak. This is an additional parameter which can be
used to follow the effect of filler and fabrication
variables.

In addition to continuing to study the variations in
crystalline parameters, we plan to look at variations, if
any, in the anisotropy of materials subjected to an
irradiation environment. These parameters obtainable
from polycrystalline graphites will better help us to
characterize the starting materials and to understand
the effects of neutron irradiation at high fluences.

14.6 REDUCTION OF GRAPHITE PERMEABILITY
BY PYROLYTIC CARBON SEALING

C. B. Pollock

We have been studying techniques by which com-
mercially available graphite can be sealed with pyrolytic
carbon so as to exclude fuel salts and gaseous fission
products. Experiences with the MSRE have demon-
strated that graphite can be manufactured by conven-
tional techniques so as to exclude fuel salts, but current
models indicate - that the graphite will not exclude
significant portions of ' 3% Xe unless the average acces-
sible pore diameter can be reduced to less than 0.1 um.
A technique for reducing the average pore size to the
desired level was developed at this laboratory.'® The
open pores in graphite are plugged with pyrolytic
carbon in a vacuum-pulse gas impregnation process.

Graphite processed in this manner has been irradiated
in the HFIR facility to a peak dose of 2.8 X 10?2
neutrons/cm?® (E > 50 keV) at a temperature of 700°C.
A plot of helium permeability as a function of fluence
is shown in Fig. 14.10. An equation of the form log F =
A + B®can be used to describe changes in the helium
permeability F as a function of the fluence ¢. Dimen-
sional changes are beginning to accelerate, and at peak
fluence they exceed dimensional changes for unim-
pregnated base stock by a factor of 2. Figure 14.11 isa
plot of fractional length and diameter changes as a
function of fluence for gas-impregnated Poco graphite
and base stock material irradiated in HFIR experiments.

We have continued to investigate pyrolytic carbon
coatings as a means of sealing graphite for molten-salt
applications. The last irradiation experiments contained
eight samples coated with pyrolytic carbon derived
from propylene. The coatings were deposited at 1300°C
in a fluidized-bed furnace. The carbon density was 1.85
g/cc, and coating thickness ranged from 3 to S mils. The
samples were all sealed to helium permeabilities of less

We have continued to evaluate samples of gas-
impregnated graphite irradiated in the previous experi-
ment. In order to examine the pore size contours in
irradiated samples we utilized a technique developed by
R. L. Beatty that consists of a mercury impregnation
step at various pressures combined with radiographic
examination. We examined a number of irradiated
samples along with unirradiated controls. The zone of
reduced pore size spectrum near the surface appeared to

HFIR, samples extracted, and dimensional measure-
ments made. Most of the materials irradiated were new
and have not received prior irradiation exposure. Thus
these materials have currently received doses no greater
than 1.5 X 1022 neutrons/cm®? (E > 50 keV). The
purposes of these irradiations were to: (1) evaluate
various isotropic coke and binder systems, (2) evaluate
several specialty grades as potential candidate materials,
(3) begin evaluation of lampblack bodies for nuclear
use, and (4) determine the effect of irradiation on
glassy carbon. Because of the relatively low fluence seen
by these samples, the present conclusions must be
considered preliminary, and higher exposure results will
be needed for confirmation.

We have previously! 7 noted that the major cause for
premature failure of the graphite is the inability of the
binder region to withstand the differential growth
between filler particles. One possible solution to the
problem is to seek improved binder systems. We have,
therefore, irradiated a number of experimental graph-
ites having isotropic filler particles but using at least
four different binders. The irradiation results of
graphite grades 586, 588, YMI-3, YM350-10 made with
AXF, 2033, and AXM filler materials bindered with
Varcum, isotruxene, and 350 pitch have been reported
previously!” The recent results for grades ROB-5,
ABS, and 9950, described in Table 14.5, are given in
Fig 14.14. We again note that the graphites follow the
generalized behavior for high-temperature calcined filler
coke graphites independent of the binder.

The irradiation dimensional change results do, how-
ever, demonstrate an effect of the method of fabrica-
tion on densification. Graphites fabricated by molding
shrink isotropically, while extruded graphites like
grades 586, 588, and ABS show that the parallel
direction shrinks 1 to 1%,% more than the transverse
direction. This implies that even the most crystal

lographically isotropic graphite will never have isotropic
dimensional changes closer than 1% if fabricated by
extrusion.

We have also suggested that one possibility for the
increased life of the Poco graphites is the extremely
small isotropic entity. The particles themselves are so
isotropic that the g-axis expansion cancels the z-axis
contraction within the particle and thus does not
concentrate the shear at the boundary region. It has
been observed that lampblack carbons have extremely
fine isotropic structures which should also reduce the
strains on the binder regions. These poor graphitic
materials have not been suggested for nuclear use
because of the extremely high crystallographic growth
rates (at least 20 times that of needle coke graphites)
reported by Gulf General Atomic.'” However, we have
demonstrated! ® that 15% Thermax additions have had
no influence on dimensional stability and also'® that

crystallite ‘sizes, are as stable or more stable than any
bulk graphite to 2 X 102? neutrons/cm?. Therefore
we have reopened the question of lampblack as a
potential nuclear material, and the results of the first
irradiation are very encouraging. We have irradiated
materials with final heat treatments from 1000 to
2800°C. These materials were characterized by extreme
isotropy, and their dimensional behavior is shown in
Fig. 14.15. The dimensional stability appears to in-
crease with increasing heat treatment temperatures, the
most stable materials being heat treated to
2300—2800°C while the least stable (the same starting

material as L-31) was treated to only 1000°C. These

materials with others are being irradiated to higher
fluences.

The evaluation of two new candidate materials
yielded one with promise and one that was highly
unstable. Stackpole Carbon Company has provided two
materials which originate from anisotropic starting
materials but by fabrication technique result in an
isotropic bulk graphite. One material, grade 2020, has
been reported previously.'” The new material, grade
HS-82, resulted in dimensional changes of +1.0% and
—3.7% in orthogonal directions at a fluence of only 1.3
X 10%? neutrons/cm? (E > 50 keV). These results
indicate again gross initial isotropy is not a sufficient
criterion to establish isotropic irradiation behavior.

The second new material is grade HL-18 obtained
from Airco-Speer Corporation. This material was found
to be very isotropic and stable to 1.3 X 10%?
neutrons/cm?. The microstructure of this grade is very
similar to the Poco materials and does follow their
general behavior up to this fluence. This graphite,
unlike the Poco grades, is available in sizes of interest
for reactor application.

Glassy carbon was irradiated to confirm the assump-
tion that it would experience significant densification.

After a 10*%.neutron/cm?® exposure, the actual meas-
urements demonstrated a 33% increase in density,
which was much larger than expected. Of four samples
irradiated, three were broken due to the severe contrac-

tion and the fourth is now so small it will not fit into
the irradiation assembly for further irradiation.

We are, of course, very interested in the alteration in
the morphology of structure, particularly the void
volume as it affects gas or salt permeation. Assuming
for simplicity a model for graphite microstructure
consisting of loose stacks of platelike material, one can
calculate from BET surface area measurements the
height of the hypothetical plates. Therefore, measure-
ments of the BET surface area of selected graphites
irradiated in HFIR have been made. The results are

147

given in Table 14.6. As can be seen by studying the
table, the increase in surface area is several times the
increase in pore volume and thus must be a result of an
increase in number of pores. This has been observed’
in the microscopic observations of the irradiated graph-
ite. We have not as yet been able to determine
microscopically the microstructural location of the
newly introduced porosity.

If we again make the assumption that the pore
structure can be approximated by a loose stack of
platelike particles, we can calculate the average distance

where
Py. = helium density (g/cm®),
A' = BET surface area (m?/g).

The layer height calculations are also given in Table
14.6." Although this approximation can only be con-
sidered to be accurate within a factor of 2 on the the
high side, the results are quite informative. The calcula-
tions show that originally before irradiation the bound-
aries admitting gas are between 2 and 15 u apart. This
corresponds to optical domain boundaries observable in
the microscope. These are regions within the particle
which have a high degree of preferred orientation and
have an equal response to sensitive tint (homogeneous

orientation). However, with irradiation the distance

between boundaries generally decreases toward values
below 0.3 i. This strongly suggests that the boundaries
beginning to open up and admit gas are truly inter-
crystalline,

There does appear to be a first-order relationship
between open pore porosity and layer height inde-
pendent of grade. This gives a further indication that
structural breakdown and volume expansion occur at
the level of crystallite boundaries. It leaves open the
question of whether this failure is intrinsic to the
individual adjacent crystallites or represents accumu-
lated strain on a grosser scale. All that can be said at
this time is that the detailed morphological structure
significantly affects the rate of both pore and surface
area generation. Conversely, the relative stability of the
Poco graphites furnishes sufficient evidence to conclude
that plastic flow can at least partially counter the gross
effects of crystallite distortion. Unfortunately, these
conclusions also suggest that sealing of the initial pore
structure may not maintain - impermeability during
damage due to the formation of a new pore system.

15. Hastelloy N

H. E. McCoy

We are concentrating on developing a modified
composition of Hastelloy N that has improved ductility
when irradiated. We have found that small additions of
Ti, Hf, and Nb are effective in improving the properties.
We dislike the hafnium addition because it is expensive
(~$100/Ib) and because it carries with it substantial
amounts of zirconium (2 to 5%). We have found that
zirconium causes weld cracking even in concentrations
as low as 0.05%,' so we must limit the amount of
hafnium added. We currently are testing laboratory and
commercial melts to determine the optimum composi-
tion. This work is very active, but the results at this
time are fragmentary, and we cannot present a very
clear picture.

The compatibility of Hastelloy N with fluoride salts
and steam continues to receive much attention. The
work with salts is still concentrating on the proposed
new coolant sodium fluoroborate. Although the com-
patibility of Hastelloy N with steam continues to look
acceptable, we are running exploratory tests on a
duplex tubing made of nickel and Incoloy 800.

Conference on the Strength of Metals and Alloys, Pacific Grove,
Calif,, Aug. 29-Sept. 4, 1970,
3Consultant from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville,

The effect is similar to that in certain austenitic steels in
which Nb, Ti, and V segregate to dislocations with
precipitation of certain MC-type carbides.*™® The dis-
location decoration process causes dissociation into two
partial dislocations. This is followed by additional
precipitation of the MC carbide, which, in the case of
NbC, causes a Frank partial to move away from the
precipitate by dislocation climb to produce a stacking
fault.* This process of precipitation and dislocation
climb is continued with the final result that planar
sheets of precipitate particles are produced which
significantly strengthen the alloy.

Our studies of this strengthening mechanism in a
nickel-base alloy have concentrated primarily on the
correlation of structures with high-temperature creep
and tensile properties. This brief paper presents a
correlation of microstructures and mechanical proper-
ties.

The aging behavior of a commercial heat of modified
Hastelloy N (Ni—12% Mo—7% Cr—1.2% Ti—0.08% C)
was assessed at 650 and 760°C for times up to 10,000
hr after solution anneals of 1 hr at either 1175 or
1260°C.

A 1260°C solution anneal drastically reduced the
number of primary carbide precipitates and associated
dislocations as compared with an 1175°C anneal. Aging
at either 650 or 760°C after the 1260°C anneal caused
precipitation of MC-type carbides on dislocations, and
stacking faults grew simultaneously with precipitation.

dark-field micrograph using a (220) MC carbide diffrac-
tion spot. No stacking fault precipitates (denoted as
SFP) were found on aging after the 1175°C anneal.

The growth of SFP at 760°C was followed by a series
of observations after aging times of 0, 0.25, 1.5, 100,
1500, 3000, and 10,000 hr. In 1 hr, nucleation of SFP

occurred along grain boundaries and around primary

carbides. In short times the stacking fault clusters

appeared as rosettes, usually with a small primary.

carbide at the center. Thus nucleation of the precipi-
tates undoubtedly occurred at the prismatic disloca-
tions, which were associated with the primary carbide
prior to aging. Extensive growth of stacking faults took
place between 1 and 200 hr at 760°C, their length
increasing from 2 to about 10 um. After 5 hr a fine
dispersion of MC carbides less than 50 A in diameter
could be easily resolved on the fault, and the stacking
fault fringe contrast was generally lost after aging times
of 1500 hr or greater.

The changes in the tensile properties at 650°C as a
function of aging time at 650 and 760°C after a 1260°C
anneal are given in Fig. 15.2. In these samples, the only
types of precipitate present before testing were those
on stacking faults and a few large primary MC carbides
within the matrix. Thus the property changes in Fig.
15.2 are attributed primarily to the influence of this
planar array of precipitates. Maximum strengthening (as
measured by the 0.2% yield strength) was achieved in
100 hr at 760°C; when aged at 650°C the strength
increased more slowly, but progressively, for aging
times up to 10,000 hr, the longest time evaluated. The

ductility decreased continuously from 42 to 12% with
aging time at both 650 and 760°C. Thus comparable
strengths and ductilities were produced during aging at
650 and 760°C, but the times to achieve a certain value
were longer at the lower temperature.

A comparison of the creep behavior of samples with
SFP (solution annealed at 1260°C, curve D) and with
no SFP (solution annealed at 1175°C, curve B) is given
in Fig. 15.3 for samples aged 1500 hr at 760°C.

different prior solution anneals, an influence of a prior
stacking fault distribution is inferred.

The creep rates (0.007 and 0.02%/hr) and times to
rupture (greater than 2400 and 1006 hr) at 40,000 psi
would indicate a factor of 2 increase in the creep
resistance that could be attributed to the SFP distri-
bution established in sample D. The creep strain at
fracture was normally lower for samples annealed at
1260°C as compared with those annealed at 1175°C
before test.

The effect of SFP formed at 760°C on the properties
at room temperature was measured using tensile tests
and microhardness (Vickers DPH, 1-kg load). An
increase in the yield strength from 36,000 to 63,000 psi
and a decrease in the total elongation from 68 to 36%
(at a strain rate of 0.002 min!) was found after aging
100 hr (Fig. 15.4) and is attributed to SFP. An average
of four microhardness values per condition is plotted in
Fig. 15.5 as a function of aging time at 760°C. The
hardness increased rapidly between 1 and 10 hr of aging
at 760°C and reached a peak in 100 hr. Slight overaging
at 10,000 hr aging time is indicated by these hardness
data.

We used the techniques of black-white outer fringe
contrast analysis to show that the stacking faults
produced in this alloy were extrinsic in nature. Prelimi-
nary experiments also indicated that the contrast
behavior of the outer partial dislocation bounding the
stacking faults at early aging times was that expected of
a Frank partial dislocation; thus the mechanism of
nucleation and growth of the SFP in this alloy is the

found to apply generally in steels.

cleation of SFP near grain boundaries could indicate
either a high density of primary carbides and disloca-
tions in this region or’ the presence of finer invisible
nuclei which generate dislocations that grow into
stacking faults. We have made observations which could
be interpreted to support either view.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) examina-

tion of samples after a 1260°C solution anneal indi-

cated patches of precipitates with high dislocation
densities within the grain interior and along grain
boundaries. Also, within some grain boundaries TEM
contrast characteristic of fine precipitates was found. In
addition, however, the postaging precipitate morphol-
ogy near grain boundaries included SFP and other types
of precipitates not associated with stacking faults. It
could be that either large primary carbides, fine
precipitates, or other invisible nuclei could be respon-
sible for enhanced nucleation of SFP near grain
boundaries. In either case the grain boundary could
supply the vacancies needed for the nucleation and
initial growth of the SFP.

Silcock and Denham® coined the term “matrix dot”
precipitation (MDP) to describe a general homogeneous
distribution of fine precipitates that they observed at
temperatures below that required for precipitation on
stacking faults in steels. They argued that this appar-
ently homogeneous precipitate is actually nucleated
heterogeneously by unknown nuclei, but punches out
dislocations during the growth process that could
dissociate into stacking faults. Froes, Warrington, and
Honeycombe® suggested that the MDP nuclei were
either collapsed vacancy disks or vacancy-solute agglom-
erates on {111} planes. Thus we feel that our TEM
observations of SFP near grain boundaries could be
related to MDP nuclei which occur nearer to grain
boundaries, but where high dislocation densities exist,
such as around large primary carbides, stacking faults
grow after dislocation decoration and dissociation.

A small zone along grain boundaries, about 0.1 um,
was denuded of SFP in our system. This observation is
contrary to the width of the denuded zone observed for
NbC SFP in steels’ and Inconel 625 (ref. 7). Differ-
ences in the width of the precipitate-free zone in this
nickel alloy and in stainless steels could be related to
several different factors. Cooling rate differences would

produce different vacancy concentration gradients near

grain boundaries which would affect the width of the
denuded zone. Starke!® has also pointed out that the
zone width is dependent on whether the aging tempera-
ture is above or below the critical temperature for
homogeneous precipitation.

The role of solute supersaturation can be approached
from chemical analyses of the precipitated carbides.
Microgram quantities of electrolytically extracted pre-
cipitates were analyzed by emission spectroscopy, and
the metallic content of the carbide was found to be
approximately 52% Mo—35% Ti—13% Cr (atomic per-
cent). A relatively small atom fraction of titanium in
the MC carbide determines its MC-type crystal structure
which is required* for precipitation and simultaneous
growth with the stacking fault, but molybdenum is the
major metallic constituent of the carbide. Both primary
carbides and the SFP carbides have the same lattice
parameter, 4.28 A, and therefore similar metallic
compositions. Since more primary carbide is dissolved
at the higher solution annealing temperature (1260°C),
a supersaturation of Mo, Ti, Cr, and C is present to
readily precipitate on the dislocations around the
remaining primary carbide particles. Although these
nucleation sites are present after annealing at 1175°C,
insufficient solute supersaturation exists to promote the
growth of SFP during subsequent aging.

Attempts were made to investigate the effects of
solute supersaturation on SFP. A series of dual anneals
(1 hr at 1260°C followed by 1 hr at 1175°C) were given
prior to aging in order to establish the grain size and
precipitate distribution characteristic of 1260°C, but
with a lower solute supersaturation characteristic of
1175°C. Removing the solute supersaturation (by hold-
ing 1 hr at 1175°C) did not eliminate the stacking fault
precipitation, even though it did cause additional
matrix precipitation (not on stacking faults) to occur,
presumably during the time at 1175°C before aging. It
was subsequently established that the kinetics of
carbide dissolution at 1175°C were sluggish, and thus
the solute supersaturation required for SFP could be
obtained in 1 hr only at the higher solutioning
temperature of 1260°C.

The effect of SFP on strengthening of this Ni—12%
Mo-7% Cr—1.2% Ti alloy is significant. The increase in
room-temperature strength and hardness is approxi-
mately equal (based on percent increase) to that
produced in steels with the addition of 1% Nb, Ti, or V
(ref. 5). Since the average size of the faults produced in

our alloy was quite large (about 10 um) it is likely that
even greater strengthening can be obtained with a finer
SFP distribution. If matrix dot precipitation® does
occur at lower aging temperatures in this system, as in
steels, then this mode of precipitation should also
enhance the strength.

Few if any data have been reported in the literature
on the creep strengthening due to SFP in steels. The
creep resistance at 650°C in our study was higher for
the sample heat treated to give SFP, but the larger grain
size for the 1260°C anneal would itself tend to reduce
the rate of creep. Thus the magnitude of the observed
creep strengthening attributable solely to SFP is some-
what uncertain. It is of course possible that shorter
aging times or optimum distribution of SFP might
produce larger reductions in creep rate than that found
here.

The fact that the ductilities are reduced by a greater
percentage at elevated temperatures than at room
temnerature in samples containing SFP undoubtedly
indicates that the grain boundary deformation is more
important at high temperatures (e.g., 650°C) than at
room temperature and that the grain boundary pre-
cipitate morphology is a factor in the ductility be-
havior.

15.2 EFFECT OF COMPOSITION ON THE
POSTIRRADIATION MECHANICAL PROPERTIES
OF MODIFIED HASTELLOY N

C.E. Sessions H.E. McCoy

We have continued postirradiation creep-rupture test-
ing of various modified Hastelloy N alloys in order to
assess the influence of composition on the high-
temperature irradiation damage. We have measured the
creep properties at 650°C for approximately 35 differ-
ent alloys after irradiation at 760°C to a thermal
fluence of 3 X 102° neutrons/cm®. All alloys were
given a preirradiation anneal of 1 hr at 1177°C.

The creep properties at 650°C following irradiation at
760°C are given in Table 15.1 and plotted in Fig. 15.6
for alloys containing various amounts of titanium. For
tests at a relatively high stress of 47,000 psi, the rupture
life varied from O to 1500 hr over the titanium

+ concentration range of 0 to 3%. This increased rupture

life is the result of a drastic decrease in the creep rate.
Unfortunately the superior creep resistance at the
higher titanium concentrations is offset by low duc-
tility, which we attribute either to precipitation of
intermetallic compounds or carbides. Compositions in
the range of approximately 2% Ti seem to offer the best

combination of strength and ductility under these test
conditions.

The influence of other alloying additions on the
postirradiation creep-rupture behavior of Hastelloy N is
shown in Fig. 15.7. The curves plotted in each case
correspond to the maximum effect attributable to
either single or multiple additions of the elements Ti,
Nb, and Hf to a nominal Ni—12% Mo-7% Cr—0.06% C
base. Figure 15.72 compares the maximum rupture life
achieved for alloys with additions of either Ti, Nb, or
Hf. The compositions investigated were: titanium from

154

0 to 3.0%, hafnium from 0.5 to 1.5%, and niobium

from 0 to 2.0%. It is clear that 3% titanium produced
greater postirradiation creep-rupture lives than either
1.2% hafnium or 2% niobium, The alloy with 1.2%
hafnium was superior to the alloy with 2% niobium

and, in fact, was comparable in rupture life to an alloy
with 2% titanium, which is not plotted here. Thus for
independent additions of either titanium or niobium,
the maximum rupture life corresponds to the highest
alloy content. However, for hafnium additions the
maximum rupture life occurred for an alloy with 1.2%
hafnium.

The combined effects of Ti-Hf, Ti-Nb, Nb-Hf, and
Ti-Hf-Nb additions to the Ni—12% Mo—7% Cr—0.06% C
base are compared in Fig. 15.75. The four curves in Fig.
15.7b represent the maximum rupture lives obtained
for various alloy classes, each of which contained
multiple additions of Ti, Nb, or Hf. The greatest
rupture life obtained at 650°C after irradiation at
760°C was for alloy 310, which contained additions of
Nb, Ti, and Hf. Several other alloys containing multiple

additions of Ti, Hf, and Nb also had good properties.
Alloys such as 307 that contained niobium and hafnium
had properties inferior to the Ti-Hf-Nb alloys but were
superior to the Ti—Hf and Ti-Nb alloys over the range
of alloy compositions investigated.

The postirradiation creep rates of these alloys are
shown in Fig. 15.8. For the singular additions of Ti, Nb,
and Hf (Fig. 15.84) the lowest creep rate was obtained
for the alloy containing 3.0% titanium. Alloys contain-
ing singular additions of 2.0% Ti, 2.0% Nb, and 1.2% Hf

had creep rates that were about equivalent. Of the
alloys containing multiple additions (Fig. 15.86), alloy
310 had the lowest creep rate, and the other three
alloys had very similar creep strengths. The scatter
bands shown in Fig. 15.8z and b are almost equivalent
and indicate that the creep strength is not strongly
affected by small additions of Ti, Nb, and Hf.

The postirradiation fracture strains for these alloys
are shown in Fig. 15.9. The strains shown in this figure
for short rupture times are lower than actually occurred

because of the experimental procedure used. The
samples were stressed before we began measuring the
strain, Since the stresses involved in the tests that failed
in short times were above the yield stress, some strain
occurred on loading. Thus the strains in short rupture
times in Fig. 15.9 may be too low by as much as 5%.
However, the results in Fig. 15.92 show the relative
effects of singular additions of Nb, Ti, and Hf. The
postirradiation fracture strains were quite low for alloy
293, which contained 3.0% titanium. However, alloy
291, with 2.0% titanium, had higher fracture strains.
Alloy 298, which contained 2.0% niobium, had low
fracture strains, and alloy 232, with 1.2% hafnium, had
the highest strains. The properties shown in Fig. 15.9b
for the alloys with multiple additions show that various
postirradiation fracture strains were obtained. Alloy
184, with 1.2% titanium and 1.2% hafnium, had the
highest fracture strain. The strains for alloy 181 were

the lowest, but they are still higher than those noted for
standard Hastelloy N. Generally, the alloys with the
higher fracture strains contain some hafnium,

able to achieve good postirradiation mechanical proper-
ties in commercial heats of Hastelloy N modified with
titanium and hafnium. However, the superior ductility
and rupture life of 184 as compared with 69641
probably indicates the beneficial influence of higher
hafnium (1.2 vs 04%) in this laboratory heat. The
equivalent ductilities of heats 309 and 69641 may
indicate that titanium contents greater than 0.5% offer
no postirradiation ductility enhancement in alloys
containing 0.4% hafnium.

A similar comparison of the effect of alloying with
titanium and niobium on postirradiation creep behavior
for laboratory and commercial heats is given in Figs.
15.13—15.15. The properties of three laboratory heats,
181 (0.5% Ti—1.85% Nb), 303 (0.4% Ti—0.84% Nb),
and 305 (0.88% Ti-1.3% Nb), are compared with those
of commercial heat 69648 (0.92% Ti—1.95% Nb). The
minimum creep rates, Fig. 15.13, of the commercial
heat 69648 are at least a factor of 7 lower for a given
stress than those of the three laboratory heats, which
plot on a single line. The total concentration of
titanium and niobium of the commercial heat is higher
than that of the lab heats, but the lower carbon content
of the commercial heat leaves this pronounced creep
strengthening (i.e., decreased creep rate) unexplained
on the basis of alloy chemistry, However, a similar
decrease in creep rate was found for unirradiated
control tests on this alloy and was attributed to
strain-enhanced precipitation.! !

Slightly inferior postirradiation creep-rupture lives
were found for the commercial heat 69648 (Fig. 15.14)
as compared with the laboratory heats. Alloy 303
exhibited the highest rupture lives. One anomalous
point for heat 69648 is stronger than heat 303, but we
have duplicate results at 40,000 psi that discredit the
anomalous test. The fracture strain data (Fig. 15.15)
indicate that heat 303 is most ductile, with elongation
of about 5% after irradiation. However, some of the
strain values plotted in Fig. 15.15 are low because of
unrecorded strain that occurred when samples were
loaded at creep stresses above about 30,000 psi. In
some of these alloys the actual fracture strains may
exceed by 5% the values plotted in Figs. 15.12 and
15.15. Generally, however, the range of ductility values
after irradiation at 760°C was from 1 to 10% for both
laboratory and commercial heats.

Comparing the two commercial heats, the stress to
cause rupture in 100 hr after irradiation at 760°C and
testing at 650°C was about 42,000 psi for 69641 and
about 37,000 psi for 69648. Thus the titanium-hafnium
modification is more beneficial, based on both the
rupture life ‘and ductility data, than the titanium-
niobium modification. This same conclusion was pre-
viously drawn for our laboratory heat results and thus
indicates that the alloying effects are similar for
commercial and laboratory heats.

15.4 EFFECT OF PRIOR AGING ON IRRADIATION
DAMAGE AT 760°C

C. E. Sessions

Aging at 650 and 760°C produces extreme changes in
the microstructure and in the types of precipitates
found in titanjum-modified Hastelloy N.!? We have
measured the creep rupture properties of two heats,
containing 0.45% and 1.2% titanium additions to the
nominal base alloy composition, following aging and
irradiation to a thermal fluence of 3 X 102° neu-
trons/cm? at 760°C. The purpose of this experiment
was to determine if the precipitate types and distribu-
tions established by aging at 650°C before irradiation
would reduce the magnitude of the irradiation damage
when irradiated at 760°C. Creep properties were meas-
ured at 650°C after irradiations for alloys given five
different solution anneal and aging treatments.

We found previously that heat 466548 (0.45% tita-
nium) had very poor properties after irradiation at
760°C,!3 and the results listed in Table 15.3 from the

2c E. Sessions, Influence of Titanium on the High-
Temperature Deformation and Fracture Behavior of Some

current experiment show that none of the combinations
of solution annealing and aging treatments significantly
improved the postirradiation properties of the alloy
relative to properties measured for the sample tested
after irradiation in the “as annealed at 1177°C”
condition. Thus for this composition none of the heat
treatments evaluated were effective in improving the
creep properties after irradiation at 760°C.

The postirradiation properties of the higher-titanium
heat, 67548 with 1.2% titanium, exhibited a different
response with prior thermal treatments. The postirradia-
tion rupture life varied from about 2000 to 11.5 hr for
tests at 27,000 psi, and the ductility varied from 8 to
0.3% with prior heat treatment. Irradiation of this alloy
after annealing 1 hr at 1177°C without aging produced
the best properties, and all aging treatments investigated
resulted in inferior postirradiation properties. Prior
aging resulted in reducing the rupture life and ductility.
The material solution annealed at 1260°C and aged
1500 hr at either 650 or 760°C had much poorer
properties than the material annealed at 1177°C and
aged. This indicates that either the larger grain size
produced at 1260°C or the precipitation on stacking
faults which occurs on aging after a 1260°C anneal'?
decreased the postirradiation creep-rupture life and
fracture strain for these test conditions.

Aging at 650°C produces MC carbides in heat
466548, and aging at either 650 or 760°C produces MC

160

carbides in heat 467548. The formation of the MC
carbide improves the ductility of the unirradiated
alloys.!4+!S Since these treatments do not produce
superior postirradiation creep properties, we must
conclude that the irradiation damage problem at 760°C
for titanium-modified alloys cannot be solved by
establishing prior precipitate distributions.

15.5 WELDABILITY OF COMMERCIAL ALLOYS
B.McNabb H.E. McCoy

Evaluation of weldability of some commercial heats
of modified Hastelloy N was conducted on eight
additional heats using the same procedures as previously
reported.'® The eight heats are all from Allvac Metals
Company, Monroe, North Carolina, and were double-
vacuum-melted SO-Ib heats yielding three plates approx-
imately % in, thick, 4 in. wide, and 10 in. long. These
were prepared for fully restrained welds as described
previously. The chemical composition and relative.
weldability rating are given .in Table 15.4. Some

observations were made relative to the welding charac-
teristics of the different heats.

Heat 70785 welded clean, and no interpass grinding
was required. No flaws were detected during welding or
in the side-bend tests. Visual, dye-penetrant, and x-ray
inspection of the welded plate showed no cracks.

Heat 70786 welded clean, with no interpass grinding,
and no flaws were detected during welding or x-ray
inspection of the welded plate. One small indication by
dye penetrant was found in one of the side-bend
specimens after bending on a Y-in. radius. The other
specimens were all bent on a %-in. radius, so this heat
probably would not have cracked under the less severe
bend test.

Heat 70787 did not weld as clean as the previous two
heats, and two small cracks were found in the root pass
where the weld stopped. These were removed by rotary
filing, and welding resumed. Cracks developed in almost
every weld stop, and several minute cracks were
detected in the cover passes. Numerous cracks were
visible in the side-bend specimens.

Heat 70788 welded clean except for about 3 in. of
weld pass No. 8, and laminated weld wire (dirty) was
suspected as the cause. No cracks were detected by
visual, dye-penetrant, or x-ray inspection of the welded
plate. There were five very small dye-penetrant indica-
tions on the four side-bend specimens, three of them in
the root pass.

Heat 70795 welded very clean, and there were no
indications of cracks.

Heat 70796 developed many small cracks during
welding, and the heat input was reduced from 180 to
145 A and 17 V with an interpass temperature of
~100°C to minimize cracking. However, there were
visible cracks in the cover passes and 29 small indica-
tions by dye penetrant in the cover passes. These
surface cracks showed up in the x ray of the welded
plate. Bend specimens opened up several large cracks.

Heat 70797 showed some interpass cracking, but the
small cracks were removed by rotary filing up to the
7th pass, where it was decided to remove all the weld
down to the root pass and use a lower heat input of 150
A. Dye-penetrant inspection at the 15th pass showed
five small cracks, which were removed by rotary filing,
and welding continued. X ray of the welded plate
showed two small round spots of porosity. Side-bend

specimens are being prepared.

Heat 70798 welded fairly clean, and no cracking was
observed by either visual, dye-penetrant, or X-ray
inspection of the welded plate. Side-bend specimens are
being prepared.

HAFNIUM CONCENTRATION (%}

Fig. 15.16. Variation of Weldability of Modified Hastelloy N
with Hafnium and Zirconium Concentrations.

Previous experience has shown that zirconium is very
detrimental to the weldability of nickel alloys and that
hafnium can be tolerated to higher concentrations.
Generally some zirconium is included as an impurity in
hafnium, and Fig. 15.16 is a plot of the hafnium vs
zirconium concentration of those modified alloys and
some alloys reported previously.!® It appears that
alloys with greater than 0.6 wt % hafnium and 0.025%
zirconium will crack during welding unless suitable
welding procedures or some judicious alloying additions
can be found. The fully restrained weld is a severe test
and shows up any tendency toward cracking. All of the
cracks in these alloys were in the weld metal. They were
very small, and the weld would still have considerable
strength even after small cracks opened up in the bend
test. Further evaluations of the weld strength in tensile
and creep tests are planned as soon as specimens can be
prepared from the welded plates.

15.6 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF
UNIRRADIATED COMMERCIAL
MODIFIED ALLOYS

H.E.McCoy B.M.McNabb

Our work on small lab melts has demonstrated the
effectiveness of strong carbide formers such as Ti, Zr,
Hf, and Nb in improving the postirradiation mechanical
properties of Hastelloy N. We have obtained several
small. heats (50 to 100 Ib) from two commercial
vendors during the past few months and are evaluating
their mechanical properties in the unirradiated and
irradiated conditions. The compositions of these alloys
are given in Table 15.5. They were double vacuum
melted, and all have low silicon concentrations. All of
these alloys have been irradiated but have not been
tested. Only the results for unirradiated alloys will be
reported in this section.

The stress-rupture properties are shown in Fig. 15.17,
and the creep rates are shown in Fig. 15.18 at 650°C.
Alloy 70-785, with 1.1% titanium, has not been tested,
but alloy 70-727, with 2.1% titanium, has good
stress-rupture and creep properties. Alloys 69-648,
69-714,.70-835, and 70-786 have various additions of
titanium and niobium. Alloy 69-714 is the weakest
alloy in this series, but it had a low carbon content of
only 0,013%. Alloy 69-648 is the strongest alloy in this
series. This alloy, as shown in Fig. 15.19, formed a
strain-induced precipitate that likely accounted for
much of its strength. Alloys 69-641, 70-787, and
70-795 contained additions of titanium and hafnium,

available only for alloy 70-788, and this appears to be

Similar creep properties at 760°C are e shown in Figs.

the strongest, with the other alloys having very similar

those of standard Hastelloy N. However, it is also quite
interesting that at 650°C the compositional variations
result in large property variations, whereas at 760°C the
variations due to chemical composition are very small.
A likely explanation for this observation is that at
650°C carbide strengthening is important, and the
properties are very dependent upon the carbide distri-
butions.” The carbide distribution is in turn a strong
function -of the particular carbide-forming elements
present and their concentration and the carbon concen-
tration. At 760°C carbides are not as effective strength-

elements are used. Metallics in the MC carbides consist
of molybdenum, chromium, and one or more of the
modifying elements. The fcc monocarbides formed have
a wide range of lattice parameters. The alloying
additions for the commercial alloys discussed are listed
in Table 15.5.

The microstructures of titanium-modified commercial
heats closely resemble the higher-purity laboratory
melts after the same thermal treatments. At the 1%
titanium level, massive stacking fault precipitation is
observed along grain boundaries and in the matrix. For
titanium concentrations of about 2%, the stacking fault
morphology is absent, although MC is precipitated in
and along grain boundaries and in the matrix.

The morphology of MC carbides in laboratory alloys
modified with hafnium (with or without titanium) are
characteristically small particles or platelets approxi-
mately 0.2 um in diameter. However, the commercial
alloys containing hafnium and titanium do not exhibit
this morphology after aging at 650 or 760°C, but rather
a network of MC carbides adjacent to jagged grain
boundaries much like that observed in titanium-
modified alloys. This typical structure is shown in Fig.
15.22 for a commercial alloy (70-787) containing 0.8%
hafnjum and 0.9% titanium as the modifying elements.
These carbides are generated during aging and have a
lattice parameter of 4.28 A, the same as those which
precipitate in the titanium-modified versions. Primary
MC carbides not put into solid solution after annealing
have large lattice parameters (e.g., 4.60 A) and are
enriched in hafnium. It appears that this difference
between laboratory and commercial alloys results from
the hafnium being tied up in primary carbides not
dissolved during the standard 1-hr solution anneal at
1177°C and therefore not available to precipitate
during aging. The titanium present in these alloys (0.8
to 1.4%) is then the modifying element which precipi-

tates in the carbides during elevated temperature
exposure.

Precipitation in the commercial niobjum-titanium-
modified alloys closely resembles that which occurs in
the 1% titanium- and hafnium-bearing alloys discussed
above. We have not studied titanium-niobium labora-
tory heats sufficiently to make a strong correlation for
this combination of elements.

The effect of silicon on microstructure is consistent
with all earlier observations in Hastelloy N. Although all
of the silicon-free alloys listed in Table 15.5 contained
only MC carbides, the addition of several tenths of a
percent silicon resulted in coarse stable MgC in the
matrix and grain boundaries. This structure is charac-
teristic of the standard air-melted Hastelloy N. A very
small amount of MC does exist, however, and any
significant improvement in postirradiation mechanical
properties in these two heats (69-344 and 69-345)
would probably be due to tying up boron in the MC
carbides rather than the effect of precipitate mor-
phology and distribution.

In summary, the effect of hafnium on precipitate
morphology and distribution in commercial alloys
containing titanium differs from that in small labora-
tory heats, with the “titanium structure” prevailing

165

rather than the “hafnium structure” which is observed
in the purer materials. The microstructure of these
commercial alloys may, however, be resistant to irradia-
tion damage.

15.8 CORROSION STUDIES
J. W. Koger

The success of a molten-salt reactor system is strongly
dependent on the compatibility of the materials of
construction with the various fluids in the reactor. The
experiments discussed in this section are being con-
ducted to determine the behavior of reactor materials in
a molten fluoride salt environment. Because heat is
transferred to and from the salt, the most prevalent
form of corrosion is temperature gradient mass transfer.
This can effect the removal of selected alloy con-
stituents, which may compromise certain favorable
properties of the alloy, and the deposition of dissolved
corrosion products can also restrict flow in the cold
part of the system. Important variables which may
affect the mass transfer process are (1) impurities in the
salts, (2) the nature and amounts of alloy constituents,
(3) salt velocity, and (4) temperature. These effects are
being studied in both isothermal and polythermal
systems with conditions based on Molten-Salt Breeder
Reactor design parameters. The isothermal tests are
conducted in static capsules, and the polythermal
experiments are in thermal convection loops and
pumped loop systems.

Many types of alloys have been considered for use in
a molten-salt environment, but the nickel-based alloys,
especially Hastelloy N, have proven to be the most
corrosion resistant. The salts of interest may be
classified as (1) LiF-BeF,-based with UF, added (fuel
salt), ThF, added (fertile salt), or ThF,4 and UF, added
(fertile-fissile salt) and (2) NaBF4-NaF (92-8 mole %),
the proposed coolant salt. The metals tested with these
salts, in addition to Hastelloy N, include iron-base
alloys such as type 304L stainless steel and a maraging
steel as well as pure metals such as chromium, iron,
nickel, and molybdenum.

Past work?® has shown that, of the major constit-
uents of Hastelloy N, chromium is much more readily
oxidized by fluoride salts than Fe, Ni, or Mo. Thus
attack is normally manifested by the selective removal
of chromium. The rate-limiting step in chromium
removal from the Hastelloy N by fluoride salt corrosion

is the solid-state diffusion of chromium in the alloy.
Several oxidizing reactions may occur depending on the
salt composition and impurity content, but among the
most important reactants are UF,, FeF,, and HF. In
fluoroborate salt systems, which in some cases have
contained large amounts of H,O and oxygen (500
ppm), we have found that elements other than chro-
mium may be oxidized by the salt, and as a result the
corrosion rate is higher and the attack is more uniform.

15.8.1 Results of Thermal Convection Loop Tests

The status of the thermal convection loops in 1 opera-
tion is summarized in Table 15.6.

Fuel Salts. — Loop 1255, constructed of Hestelloy N
with 2% niobium and containing a simulated MSRE fuel
salt plus 1 mole % ThF,, continues to operate without
major difficulty after 8.4 years. We are currently

loop 1255. The corrosion rate at the highest tempera-
ture, 688°C, assuming uniform wall removal, has
averaged 1.1 mils/year.

Because of interest in iron-base alloys with lower
chromium contents for possible containment of molten
salts, we have inserted a maraging steel (12% Ni—5%
Cr—3% Mo—bal Fe) specimen in loop 1258. Table 15.7
compares the weight loss and corrosion rate of this
specimen with type 304 stainless steel and Hastelloy N
under similar conditions of exposure. As expected,
because of the lower chromium content the maraging
steel shows better corrosion resistance than the stainless

still superior to both.

Figure 15.23 shows the metallographic appearance of
the maraging steel specimen after exposure for 5700 hr
at 662°C. Most of the attack is manifested as surface
pitting, but there are also subsurface voids such as were
seen in the stainless steel specimens of this loop.?! The
void formation is attributed to removal of chromium
atoms from the surface. This results in a concentration
gradient and causes -like atoms from the underlying
region to diffuse toward the surface, thus leaving
behind a zone enriched with vacancies. In time these
vacancies accumulate and form visible voids.

Loop NCL-16, constructed of standard Hastelloy N,
with removable specimens in each leg, has operated
with the two-fluid MSBR fuel salt for over two years.
The corrosion rate at the highest temperature, 704°C, is
0.04 mil/year assuming uniform attack. For this system,
as with all others studied to date, titanium-modified

Hastelloy N specimens (12% Mo—7% Cr—0.5% Ti—bal
Ni) continue to have smaller weight changes than
standard Hastelloy N specimens (16% Mo—7% Cr—5%
Fe—bal Ni) under equivalent conditions. We attribute
this to the absence of iron in the modified alloys. The
chromium content of the salt, currently 400 ppm,
continues to show a small increase with time, while the
iron content of the salt has apparently stabilized.
Earlier?? the iron content of the salt had decreased,
suggesting that the reaction

FeF,(d) + Cx(s) == CrF,(d) + Fe (deposited) ,

where
d = dissolved in salt,
s = solid solution,

was in part responsible for chromium mass transfer.
Since no changes in iron are now seen, the UF,

must now be the primary cause for the chromium

controlled by solid-state diffusion of chromium in the
alloy.

15.8.2 Fertile-Fissile Salt

- Loop NCL-18, constructed of standard -Hastelloy N,
with removable specimens in each leg, has operated for
about two years with the salt mixture LiF-BeF,-
ThF4-UF (68-20-11.7-0.3 mole %). The weight change
at the highest temperature, 704°C, is —1.5 mg/cm?®.
Assuming uniform attack, the corrosion rate is 0.05
mil/year. The titanijum-modified Hastelloy N specimens
show smaller weight losses than standard Hastelloy N
specimens in equivalent positions, and, as in the case of
NCL.--16, the chromium content of the salt is increasing
(190 ppm at the present) while the iron content is
stable. The loop is not operating at present because of
an electrical short in one of the main heaters, which
burned a hole in the loop piping. Repair work has
begun.

Hastelloy N loop NCL-19A is similar to NCL-19 but
has a molybdenum-sheathed finger containing bismuth
at the bottom of the hot leg.2® The loop has circulated
the fertile-fissile MSBR salt for over 4600 hr. The
weight change at the highest temperature, 704°C, is
—0.4 mg/cm?. Assuming uniform attack, the calculated
corrosion rate is 0.04 mil/yr. No difference is apparent
in the weight loss of a standard Hastelloy N specimen
and a modified specimen (12% Mo—7% Cr—0.4%
Ti—0.1% Fe—2.0% Cb) at identical positions. The
chromium content in the salt has increased from 25 to
128 ppm, and the iron content has decreased from 111
to 30 ppm. This also suggests a reaction of the type
Ci(s) + FeF,(d) » CrF,(d) + Fe (deposited). The
bismuth content of the salt is very low, 3 ppm.

We have also examined specimens from loop NCL-19
to determine if bismuth contained in a “dead leg”
before the heated vertical leg in any way affected the
properties of the Hastelloy N. In one such test a
specimen from the hottest position was bent around a
Y-in-diam tube and examined metallographically.
There was no indication of cracking or weakening of
grain boundaries, and as with previous examinations,?*
we saw no signs of salt or bismuth attack.

15.8.3 Blanket Salt

Loop NCL-15A, constructed of standard Hastelloy N,
with removable specimens in each leg, has operated two
years with the LiF-BeF, salt containing 25 mole %
ThF,. Specimens exposed to this salt tend to be
“glazed” with a coating that is impossible to remove
without damaging the metal. This has introduced a
positive but random bias in our measured weight
changes; however, there has been little change in the
chromium concentration of the salt, which is indicative
of low corrosion rates.

15.8.4 Coolant Salt

Loops NCL-13A and NCL-14, constructed of stand-
ard Hastelloy N, with removable specimens in each leg,
have operated for two and three years, respectively,
with the fluoroborate salt which has been proposed as
the MSBR secondary coolant. Figures 15.24 and 15.25
give the weight changes of specimens at various temper-
atures as a function of operating time. The overall
corrosion rates at the maximum temperature, 605°C,
are 0.5 mil/year and 0.7 mil/year for loops NCL-13A
and NCL-14 respectively. The attack is general, and
actual measurements of specimens show changes in
thickness agreeing with those calculated from weight
changes. )

Abrupt increases in the slope of the weight change
curves (increased gains and losses) indicate changes in
the oxidation potential of the salt which we believe
were caused by inadvertent air leaks into the system.?$
These slope changes were accompanied by increases in
Cr, Ni, Fe, and Mo in the salt, which would indicate
general attack of the alloy. Under conditions where
external impurities did not enter the loops, chromium
was the only element removed from the alloy, and
corrosion rates during these periods fell to as low as
0.08 mil/year.

The air leaks in loops 13A and 14 have resulted at
various mechanical joints in the system such as ball
valves, level probes, and pressure gages, all located in
the cover gas space above the circulating salt. We had
gained extensive experience with similar mechanical
joints prior to testing fluoroborate salt mixtures and
had encountered no leakage problems. Therefore the
frequency of leaks in these two fluoroborate loops
strongly suggests that the cover gas atmosphere in these
tests has resulted in deterioration of our mechanical

seals. We are currently investigating the chemical nature
of the cover gas to determine any possible contaminants
which might have caused such deterioration. Despite
the known problems of air inleakage, these loops have
operated for over two years with the fluoroborate salt,
and the overall corrosion rate is within acceptable
limits.

We are currently using loop NCL-14 to evaluate the
corrosion properties of pure Cr, Fe, Mo, and nickel 280
(commercially pure nickel) at 600°C in NaBF,-NaF
(92-8 mole %) salt. As a consequence of the air leaks
discussed above, the H,O content of the salt in loop
NCL-14 is at an abnormally high level of approximately
2000 ppm. We initially examined the pure metal
specimens after a 234-hr exposure. On removal, we
found that the chromium and iron specimens had
completely disintegrated. The molybdenum specimen
showed no weight change, and the nickel specimen
showed a slight weight gain. The chromium and iron
specimens were replaced, and a second experiment was
conducted for 23 hr. Again, the molybdenum specimen
did not change weight, and the nickel specimen
showed a slight weight gain. Very little of the chro-
mium specimen remained, and the weight loss of the
iron specimen was 40 mg/cm? (70 mils/year). Close
examination of the chromium specimen showed it to be
coated with a black reaction layer ~% 4 in. thick. Laser
spectroscopy of the outer surface of the black material
showed iron and boron as major constituents and
sodium and chromium as minor constituents. However,
x-ray diffraction of the bulk coating showed it to be
over 90% NaBF,. This black coating has been observed
on Hastelloy N specimens exposed to impure NaBF,-
NaF (92-8 mole %) in the past,?® but in these cases it
was too thin or too adherent to remove and identify.

Attack of Hastelloy N by impure fluoroborate salt
tends to be nonselective in nature; that is, all com-

170

diffusion in the alloy. When the oxidation potential of
the salt is reduced, however, as would be the case in a
purer fluoroborate salt, attack of Hastelloy N becomes
more selective, and the buffering effect of chromium
may become more important. In loop tests of nickel
molybdenum alloys containing Fe, Nb, or W, DeVan
observed?” that the concentration of these elements in
FLINAK2® salt was lowered by the presence of
chromium in the alloy. These observations suggest that
the incorporation of an active metal such as chromium
would effectively inhibit attack in a Hastelloy
N—fluoroborate circuit.

Loop NCL-17, constructed of commercial Hastelloy
N with removable specimens in each leg, is being
operated to determine the effect of steam inleakage in a
fluoroborate salt—Hastelloy N circuit. This experiment
has run for over 10,000 hr and is continuing in order to
provide information on the immediate and long-range
corrosion of the system after steam injection. The loop
was operated for 1000 hr, the specimens removed and
weighed, and steam forced into the flowing salt system
through a 16-mil hole in a closed %-in. Hastelloy N
tube, simulating a leaking heat exchanger. Steam was
forced into the system until the pressure of the cover
gas began to increase, thus indicating that no more
steam was soluble in the salt. Figure 15.26 shows the

. weight changes and temperatures for the specimens in

ponents of Hastelloy N suffer oxidation, and surfaces of ~

the alloy appear to recede uniformly. However, in this
experiment with pure metals, only the chromium and
iron were noticeably attacked, the chromium more than
iron. We conclude, therefore, that the pure chromium
and iron specimens in this system acted to buffer the
attack of the nickel and molybdenum specimens. The
buffering effect apparently is much less when chro-
mium and iron are present as alloying additions in
Hastelloy N, presumably because their chemical activity
in the alloy is too low or the rate at which they can
enter the salt is too slow, being limited by solid-state

NCL-17. As usual, the changes are temperature de-
pendent, and the rates are decreasing with time. The
corrosion rate appears to have stabilized, and no
plugging conditions have been noted. Figure 15.27
shows the specimens from the loop 424 hr after
exposure to steam. The specimens with the etched
appearance have lost weight, and those that are dark-
ened have gained weight.

For the last 3500 hr the concentrations of impurity
constituents in the salt (Fe, Cr, Ni, Mo, H,0, and 0,)
have remained relatively constant (Table 15.8). The
present chromium level is ~320 ppm. The results of this
test show that the Hastelloy N system containing
fluoroborate salt can tolerate inleakage of steam and,
once the leak is repaired, could continue to operate
without extensive damage even if the salt were not
repurified.

with removable specimens in each leg, has circulated a
fluoroborate coolant salt for 6000 hr and is being

secondary circuit. Forced air cooling (as: opposed to
ambient air cooling used on other thermal-convection
loops) is used on the lower half of the cold leg, and the
operating temperatures obtained were 687°C maximum
and ~438°C minimum (a AT of 250°C). Table 15.9

corrosion rates are the lowest yet attained with a
fluoroborate mixture and confirm the importance of
salt purity on compatibility with structural materials.
The low values of chromium and water in the salt are
also indicative of low corrosion rates.

Our data on fluoroborate salts point out that impuri-
ties such as H,O and O, strongly affect the fluoride

oxidation potential of this salt. However, we do not yet
know the chemical forms taken by these impurities
upon entering the salt. Corrosion rates show an instan-
taneous increase following an air or steam leak into the
fluoroborate salt. Once the leak has been detected and
corrected, the corrosion rate drops sharply. Analyses of
the salt for water (Karl Fischer method)? and oxygen
(KB1F, method)®*® show an increase in both contam-
inants as the corrosion rate increases, but the apparent
level of the contaminants does not show a correspond-
ing drop as the corrosion rate decreases. One tentative
explanation for this behavior is that moisture reacts
with the salt to produce HF and compounds (oxides
and hydroxides) which analyze as H,O and O, by the
present analytical techniques. The HF causes rapid
oxidation of the containment material and is used up in
the process. The compounds which analyze as H, O and
0, remain, but have only a minor effect on corrosion
rate.

in the %-in.-OD, 0.042-in.-wall Hastelloy N loop is
nominally 10 fps. The maximum and minimum salt
temperatures of the loop are 588 and 510°C respec-
tively. Hastelloy N corrosion test specimens are exposed
to the circulating salt at three temperatures, 510, 555,
and 588°C.

15.9.1 Operations

The fourth run, which was of 2475 hr duration, was
completed on March 18, 1970. Completion of this run
brought the total accumulated time at design conditions
to 8573 hr. Following run 4, corrosion specimens were
removed for metallographic examination and weight
change measurements. The Na; CrF4 corrosion product
seen on the pump bowl surfaces after some previous
runs was not apparent after run 4. The temperature of
the pump bowl (510°C) is close to the coldest
temperature.

The corrosion test specimens were reinstalled, and on
April 16, 1970, the loop was brought to design
conditions for the start of run 5. Loop operation was
interrupted on several occasions by a series of mechan-
ical problems with loop components, and finally run 5
was terminated after 422 hr of operation at design
conditions when the pump bearings failed. The prob-
lems encountered in run 5, along with times when salt
samples were taken for analysis, are summarized in
Table 15.10 and are discussed below.

On May 4, 1970, after the pump had been removed,
we found approximately 50 g of intermixed white and
green material on the pump liner above the liquid level.
Analysis of a small portion of this material showed
about equal amounts of NaF and NaBF,, with 4300

ppm chromium, assumed to be in the form of Nay CrFy.
The mass of chromium was equivalent to a 25-ppm
change in the chromium content of the salt. A salt
sample taken May 13, 1970, contained 153 ppm
chromium, which was 100 ppm less than our initial salt
sample. This indicates either that we did not recover all
the green material during pump disassembly or that our
sample of the white and green material was not
representative. At present we do not know the condi-
tions that caused the deposition of the corrosion
product in the pump liner.

The pump-bearing failure at 422 hr of operation (May
15, 1970) allowed the pump impeller to come in
contact with the impeller housing and caused abrasion
of the impeller. Metal particles from the impeller were
seen in the salt left in the pump bowl after dumping.
Accordingly, the pump was removed from the loop, and
at the same time we removed the corrosion test
specimen assemblies. This allowed us to clean the loop
piping by flushing with demineralized water. A total of
3.31 g of Hastelloy N particles was recovered from the
loop. The loop was dried by air purging, and the
corrosion specimen assemblies and pump were rein-
stalled. A 404 pore size nickel filter was also installed
in the dump tank line to filter any metal particles from
the salt being returned to the loop.

We made the following modifications to improve the
performance ‘and reliability of the pump: (1) proper
tolerance between pump shaft and bearings as recom-
mended by the bearing manufacturers (this is especially
important for the present relatively high pump speed of
5000 rpm), (2) use of a rotary oil union designed for
operation up to 10,000 rpm in the pump coolant and
lube oil line, (3) development of a belt-tightening
procedure to ensure that the pump drive belts do not
produce excessive radial load on the bearings, (4)
compilation of inspection procedures to ensure proper
assembly of the pump, and (5) improvements in the
pump coolant and lube oil system to ensure reliable oil
flow.

Because of the discontinuance of shift coverage by
technicians in Building 9201-3, Y-12 Plant, on July 31,
1970, we revised the loop instrumentation and control
system prior to the start of run 6. This involved
redesign of the control system to protect the loop
against changes in flow, temperature excursions, or
malfunction of loop components during unattended
operation.

Corrosion test specimens were reinstalled in the loop,
and the modifications to the instrumentation and
control system for unattended operation were com-
pleted in mid-August. NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %) salt

174

was returned to the loop from the dump tank through
the 40-u pore size nickel filter. The loop was brought to
design conditions for the start of run 6 on August 26,
1970, and is operating satisfactorily. Approximately
three - months (May 15 to August 26, 1970) were
required to return the loop to operating conditions
after the termination of run 5. Part of this time
(approximately one month) was due to the unavail-
ability of craft labor during the strike. Thus about two
months were spent in the necessary repair of the loop
and modifications to the loop system for unattended
operation.

159.2 Cold Finger Corrosion Product Trap

During the scheduled loop shutdown at the end of
run 4, we enlarged the access port in the pump bowl
from %-in. to %-in. diameter (maximum size possible
in the pump bowl) in order to provide more flexibility
in the design and operation of cold finger devices.>! We
had concluded from previous tests that a lack of
wetting prevented any salt deposit from adhering to the
surface of the cold finger and that a grooved or
roughened surface would be helpful.

With the enlarged access port we were able to insert a
%-in.-OD cold finger with circumferential grooves
which was previously used in another circulating fluoro-
borate loop (PKP-1) and on which significant deposits
of salt containing Na; CrF¢ were obtained.3?

Several tests were made during run § with this cold
finger at temperatures between 150 and 420°C. The
cold finger was inserted below the liquid surface in the
pump bowl for periods of 5 to 6 hr for each test. The
salt temperature in the pump bowl was approximately
516°C. Small deposits with a light-green color (indica-
tion of corrosion product Na; CrFg) were occasionally
seen on the cold finger when it was withdrawn into the
sight glass above the pump bowl. However, such
deposits usually dropped off immediately. Apparently
any slight vibration is enough to knock most of the
deposited material loose before the cold finger can 1 be
pulled all the way out of the pump bowl.

We plan to try other types of cold finger devices in
loop MSR-FCL-1 as time permits.

15.9.3 Metallurgical Analysis

The weight changes of Hastelloy N specimens in loop
MSR-FCL-1 are compared in Table 15.11 for each of
five test runs. The corrosion rate decreased steadily over
the first four runs and, at the conclusion of run 4, had
dropped to 0.3 mil/hr at the point of maximum
temperature (588°C). However, the corrosion rate
during run 5 was higher than in any of the preceding
runs.

Although the increased rate of attack during run 5 is
undoubtedly associated with operating difficulties
encountered during the run, we have not pinpointed the
specific causes. Increased corrosion is normally accom-
panied by an increase in impurities in the salt; however,
we did not see any significant impurity changes during
run 5. Because of the nature of the last pump-bearing
failure, we were not able to take a salt sample from the
loop before shutdown in our normal manner. Thus a
sample was taken from the dump tank after the loop
had been shut down. However, because of dilution
there was no assurance that the sample was representa-
tive of the salt which had circulated in the loop.

- Specimens in the coldest part of the system gained
weight during the first three runs and then lost a small
amount of weight during run 4. Thickness measure-
ments of these specimens disclosed that the upstream
end had reduced in thickness compared with the middle
and downstream end. Specimens at other locations in
the loop (555 or 588°C) showed similar behavior,
although smaller in magnitude. Figure 15.28 shows the
visual appearance of a specimen at 588°C after run 4
and clearly illustrates the heavier attack at the upstream
end. Changes in specimen thickness are summarized in
Table 15.12, and they are quite consistent with the
changes calculated from weight measurements.

Figure 15.29 shows specimens 2 (555°C), 4 (588°C),
and 8 (510°C) at the end of run 5. Note the change in
appearance of specimen 4 between run 4 (Fig. 15.28)
and run 5 (Fig. 15.29). The etched appearance of
specimen 4 after run 5 is typical of the appearance of
Hastelloy N specimens in natural convection corrosion
test NCL-17 (see previous section) after extreme oxidiz-
ing conditions had been created by intentional steam
inleakage. We are hopeful that further sampling of the
salt prior to test run 6 will reveal the contaminants

15.9.4 Forced-Convection Loop MSR-FCL-2

We have completed the design of a second molten-salt
forced-convection loop, designated MSR-FCL-2, which
is to be used to study the mass transfer properties of
Hastelloy N in fluoroborate-type coolant salt systems at
conditions proposed for the MSBR.2>3 Some compo-
nent parts of the loop have been fabricated, and
assembly is in progress.

The loop will be constructed of %-in.-OD, 0.042-in.-
wall commercial Hastelloy N tubing and will contain
three corrosion test specimen assemblies (metallurgical
specimens) exposed to the circulating salt at three
different temperatures and bulk flow velocities of 10
and 20 fps (4 gpm flow rate). The test specimens are
designed for installation and removal without draining
salt from the loop.

Salt will be circulated in the loop by means of a
new-design centrifugal pump®? (designated ALPHA)
designed for reliable long-term operation at flow rates
up to 30 gpm and heads to 300 ft. This pump is now
being tested with water in a pump test stand to
determine pump characteristics.

Two resistance-heated sections which are independ-
ently controlled and two finned-tube coolers will
provide ‘a temperature differential of at least 165°C
(300°F) at a flow rate of 4 gpm. One resistance-heated
section is designed with special thermocouple wells at
the inlet and outlet and with additional thermocouples

15.10 CORROSION OF HASTELLOY N IN STEAM
B.McNabb =H. E. McCoy

Hastelloy N still appears to have good corrosion
resistance in steam after approximately 5000 hr at

538°C in the Bull Run Facility. The same trends noted
previously are continuing, and the weight gains con-
tinue to be small, with the loss of metal less than 0.25
mil/year, assuming uniform corrosion. Some specimens
are being tested in steam at higher temperatures in the
Bartow Plant of the Florida Power Corporation. The
weight changes were slightly higher at 593°C, but the
corrosion rate was less than 0.5 mil/year over 10,000

hr, assuming uniform corrosion. An air-melted heat had
a slightly higher corrosion rate than a vacuum-melted
heat. The main differences in composition are that the
air-melted heat contained about 0.5% each of silicon
and manganese, whereas the vacuum-melted heat con-
tained about 0.1% of each element.

We noted nodules or blisters on the surface of the
vacuum-melted heat (2477) that were aligned on
machining marks or scratches. Figure 15.32 shows an
optical picture and microprobe displays for Fe, Ni, Mo,

that the nodules are enriched in iron and depleted in
other elements except oxygen.

Figure 15.33 shows the microprobe x-ray displays for
Fe, Ni, Cr, and M for a cross section of one of the
nodules shown in Fig. 15.32. It appears that iron is
concentrated at the outer surface, nickel is either with
the iron or just below the surface, and below this layer
the material is concentrated in chromium and molyb-
denum and depleted in nickel. Figure 15.34 shows the

air-melted heat (5065) exposed to the same conditions.
The relative concentrations of the different elements
are changed somewhat, but the trends are the same as
for the vacuum-melted heat 2477. There were no
significant concentration variations of manganese or
silicon in the corroded areas in either material.

There are two possible mechanisms that could cause
nodules to align with scratches or machining marks. An
uneven surface or protrusion would expose more metal
or surface area to the corroding medium and offer

~ preferred nucleation sites for nodules or blisters, and

the surface would be easier to erupt when a critical
oxide thickness was reached. Another mechanism in-
volves small particles of iron oxide that are entrained in
the steam flowing past the specimens, and surface
roughness would increase the sticking probability of the
particles on the specimen. We have conclusive evidence
that iron from the primarily iron systems at both

facilities is being deposited on the specimen surfaces. A
specimen-in the Bull Run Steam Plant exhibited this
same type of nodular alignment on scratches. Micro-
probe examination showed that iron was present in the
nodules in high concentrations (over 50%), although
there was “only 0.046% iron in the specimen. A
specimen of pure nickel was removed after a short time
with a thick oxide that spalled easily. A small piece of

the oxide contained about 2% iron. Operating history at

Bull Run has shown that large amounts of a-Fe, 05 are
deposited in traps and filters throughout the plant. The
chromium concentration is so low in Hastelloy N (7%)
that the presence of the iron-rich oxide may have the
effect of locally reducing the chromium level.

The facility at Bull Run is being modified to include
samples that are stressed during exposure to steam.
These samples are very critical for assessing the com-
patibility of Hastelloy with steam.

Our results on the compatibility of unstressed Hastel-
loy N samples with steam look encouraging, but prior
results®® obtained at another installation leave some
doubt concerning the use of Hastelloy N in steam under
stress. The further possibility of reducing the migration
of tritium into the steam by allowing a fairly high
concentration of water in the coolant salt and by having
an oxide barrier on the steam side imposes further
restrictions upon the materials. The desired corrosion
resistance on the fluoroborate side is best obtained by a
material with low chromium content, such as pure

GEAP-4351 (July 1963).

nickel, and the corrosion resistance to steam and the
barrier to tritium diffusion on the steam side are best
obtained with a material high in chromium. Thus the
requirements for materials are in conflict, and the
potential usefulness of a duplex tube in this case looks
very good.

The International Nickel Company (INCO) has made
a 10-ft length of duplex tubing for evaluation. The
material on the inside (steam side) is Incoloy 800
(Fe—34% Ni—21% Cr) and the material on the salt side
is nickel 280 (pure nickel with some Al, 0; added for
grain size control). The outside diameter is 0.750 in.,
with layers of each material about 0.065 in. thick.

The tubing was made by coextruding the two
materials into a tube shell and then drawing into tubing.
Longitudinal and transverse views of the interface
between the two materials are shown .in Fig. 15.35.
Figure 15.354 shows a longitudinal view. The line of
porosity marks the interface. The black stringers are

is a powder-metallurgy product and relatively high in
oxygen. In the transverse view in Fig. 15.355, the cross
sections of the oxide stringers are visible.

The tubing was etched cathodically to reveal the grain
sizes of the materials. As shown in Fig. 15.36, the grain
sizes are quite similar, indicating that the AL, Oj is
effective in inhibiting the grain growth of the nickel.

Several pieces of the tubing were thermal cycled for
various lengths of time. The cycle used was 15 min at
650°C and 5 min at 25°C. The samples were sealed in
quartz to protect them from: oxidation. The exact
heating and cooling rates are not known, though they
were quite rapid. The samples were examined metal
lographically - after cycling. No changes were visible,
even in the sample that had been cycled 600 times.
 

 

16. Support for Chemical Processing

J. R. DiStefano

The reductive extraction process for removal of
protactinium and fission products from molten-salt
reactor fuels requires materials that are corrosion
resistant to bismuth and molten fluoride salts at 600 to
700°C. On the basis of solubility data in bismuth,
molybdenum, tungsten, rhenium, tantalum, and
graphite might all be satisfactory containment ma-
terials, since they also appear to have reasonably good
compatibility with molten salt.

After considering other factors such as cost, availa-
bility, fabricability, and reactions with gaseous environ-
ments, as well as corrosion resistance, we have decided
to concentrate on the development of molybdenum for
this application. At present our program is divided into
two parts. One is the fabrication of a molybdenum loop
for the Chemical Technology Division to determine
hydrodynamic data relating to the reductive extraction
process. The second is research to study the compati-
bility of several of the above materials under various
processing conditions and to investigate some possible
techniques of coating these corrosion-resistant materials
on conventional alloy substrates.

16.1 CONSTRUCTION OF A MOLYBDENUM
REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION TEST STAND

J. R. DiStefano

In conjunction with the Chemical Technology Di-
vision, a molybdenum test stand for studying a reduc-
tive extraction process for molten-salt purification has
been designed. Both bismuth and salt will counter-
currently flow through a packed column, and we will
obtain engineering data relating to column per-
formance. In addition we shall also obtain valuable
experience in fabricating complex molybdenum equip-
ment as well as compatibility data on molybdenum
under a variety of experimental conditions.

Although welding and brazing will be used to fabri-
cate and assemble the loop, we are also investigating

184

various types of molybdenum mechanical couplings. We
have obtained experimental metal seal couplings from
Stanley Corporation and Aeroquip Corporation, and
these are currently being evaluated by leak checking
during thermal cycling from 650°C to room temper-
ature.

Three sizes of tubing will be used for the connecting
lines of the loop. These are ' in. OD by 0.020 in. wall,
3, in. OD by 0.025 in. wall, and % in. OD by 0.030 in.
wall. This material was purchased from a commercial
vendor and is currently undergoing additional non-
destructive inspection for defects.

More detailed information on the design of this loop
is presented in Part 5 of this report. Progress on
welding, brazing, and fabrication of molybdenum com-
ponents is reported in this section.

16.2 FABRICATION DEVELOPMENT OF
MOLYBDENUM COMPONENTS

R.E. McDonald A.C. Schaffhauser

We are supplying molybdenum components for a
chemical processing test stand. This involves procure-
ment of materials that are commercially available as
well as the development of fabrication processes for
other components.

We have developed a back-extrusion process’ for
fabrication of 3%-in.-diam closed-end vessels required
for the bismuth and salt head pots and the upper and
lower disengagement sections of the extraction column.
Figure 16.1 shows two types of end geometries we have
back-extruded. Figure 16.12 shows a head with a thick
end section, and Fig. 16.15 shows an end with extruded
bosses. Both can be machined to provide internal
trepans for welding and support for the inlet and exit

16.3 WELDING OF MOLYBDENUM
A.J. Moorhead T.R. Housley

An assembly procedure has been developed for
fabrication of the chemical processing loop which was
described in an earlier report.> Our basic philosophy is

that” welds will ‘primarily provide corrosion-resistant
seals’ and that proper joint design and brazing will
. provide. joint strength. Therefore, all of the welds will

be reinforced by brazing. -
~ There are two major types of joint in this loop:
tube-to-header and tube-to-tube. There are 17 tube-to-

“header joints in which tubes either terminate at the

header or extend into the pot. Ten of these will be in
direct” contact with bismuth, and welding will be
required for corrosion resistance. The other seven joints
are in the gas region above the salt and bismuth, where
brazing is considered adequate. Two headers (plus a

“center section for the disengaging pots) will be electron

for welding studies. The maximum inside length we -

have been able to back-extrude in a single step is about
4 in. at temperatures up to 1500°C. At 1650°C an 8-in.
length was back-extruded; ‘however, reaction with the
tooling produced surface tears. We will attempt to
produce the 10-to-12-in. inside lengths required for

upper and lower vessels of the ‘extraction column by -

multiple back-extrusion steps.’ “We are also modifying
the tooling in order to provide some relief in back of
the working surfaces to reduce frictional forces resisting
flow during back extrusion.

Some Of the components, such as small-diameter
tubing, round bar, rod, plate, and sheet are com-
mercially available, and we are developing specifications
for the procurement and machining of these com.

entire assembly (including the tubes which are brazed
only) will then be vacuum furnace brazed using a
bismuth-corrosion-resistant filler metal. Next, the four
pots will be fastened to a vertical support stand, and the
interconnecting tubes will be attached. After each
tube-to-tube weld is made, a reinforcing sleeve will be
induction brazed around the joint.

We are developing procedures for joining the tubes to
the headers using the electron beam process. A typical
joint design is shown in Fig. 16.2. Electron beam
welding minimizes both oxygen contamination and
excessive grain growth, and this type of joint will
provide mechanical support of the weld and is amenable
to back-brazing. Welding parameters and specific joint
dimensions have been developed (on *%; X 3 X 3 in. flat
coupons) for welding %-, %-, and '% -in.-diam tube-to-
header joints. A typical weld is shown in Fig. 16.34. All
of the welds were excellent in appearance and helium
leak-tight, even those made while welding parameters
were being developed. Most had helium leak rates less
than 1 X 1072 atm cm? sec”. Several of these welds
were sectioned for metallographic examination, in-
cluding the one shown in Fig. 16.35. Note the narrow
heat-affected zone and the small grains in the weld
compared with those usually found in welds made by
the gas tungsten arc process.

Two tube-to-header joints have been back-brazed with
a different filler metal. Visually, the brazes look
acceptable, but examination is not complete.

187

Tube-to-tube joints in the loop will be welded by the
gas tungsten arc process, either manually in an argon.
filled chamber or automatically in the field using a
commercial orbiting arc welding head. In order to select
tubing with wall thicknesses that would allow us to
weld by either technique, manual gas tungsten arc welds
were made joining six different sizes of tubing. If a tube
can be manually welded without burn-through or
excessive root reinforcement, it should also be weldable
using automatic equipment. The outside diameter and
the wall thicknesses of the tubes which were welded
were % in., 20 mils; ¥; in., 32 mils; ¥% in., 25 mils; %
in., 35 mils; *%, in., 30 mils; and % in., 40 mils. The
tubes with the thinner wall in each size were fabricated
by drawing, while the thicker-wall tubes were manu-
factured by drilling rod. All of the welds except those
in the two ¥% -in., 32-mil tubes had helium leak rates less
than 1 X 10™° atm cm® sec”. Howéver, none of the
tubes showed an indication of a leak when they were
fluorescent-penetrant inspected. Three typical welds are
presented in Fig. 16.4. Since we were able to success-
fully weld both the thin- and thick-wall tubing, the
thin-wall tubing was purchased, since it was less
expensive and more readily available.

We are presently developing procedures for making
tube-to-tube field welds using the orbiting arc head
pictured in Fig. 16.5. Eight bead-on-sheet-type welds
have been made, all on %-in.-diam, 20-mil-wall molyb-
denum tubes. Hot cracking in the weld center line was

very bad with the first four tubes, but this problem was
eliminated when the welding speed was doubled.

Increasing the welding speed (reducing the welding

time) also reduced the amount of discoloration near the
weld. We have also made improvements by optimizing
the argon gas flow (at about 10 ft*/hr) and minimizing
the clamping pressure in the weld head. However, each
of the last three welds has had a single short crack near
the weld tie-in area as revealed by penetrant inspection.

16.4 DEVELOPMENT OF BISMUTH-RESISTANT
FILLER METALS FOR BRAZING MOLYBDENUM

N.C.Cole J. W.Koger

In building complex structures of molybdenum,
brazing can be used as the primary joining technique or
as a backup to welding (as in back-brazing). Since no
commercial filler metals for brazing molybdenum are
corrosion resistant to bismuth, we are developing
brazing alloys for use in fabricating parts of a chemical
processing test stand.

An additional experimental filler metal, Fe-Mo-Ge-
C-B (42M), has been added to our braze alloy evalua-
tion program. This alloy brazes at the lowest temper-
ature (1100°C) of our experimental iron-base brazing
alloys and, like the others discussed previously,’ wets
and flows on molybdenum very well. BE

Successful brazes with four iron-base filler metals,
Fe-Mo-C-B-Ge (42M), Fe-Mo-C-B (35M and 36M), and
Fe-C-B (16M), were made in a variety of joint designs,
positions (horizontal and vertical flow), atmospheres,
and furnaces. Molybdenum sheet and tubing have been
brazed with each of these alloys in vacuum, helium, and
argon atmospheres. However, it should be noted that in
induction brazing these iron-base alloys must be
securely attached to the joint area (by wiring, etc.) to
prevent the magnetic field from pulling them away.

Additional tests have been conducted to determine
the compatibility of 35M, 36M, and 42M with static
bismuth. Each brazing alloy was tested for 644 hr at
600°C in separate molybdenum capsules to eliminate
interactions between the alloys. The volume of bismuth
was sufficient that corrosion would not be limited by
the bismuth becoming saturated with the braze alloy
constituents. The braze alloy 42M appeared to be the
most corrosion resistant. As seen in Fig. 16.6, little, if
any, attack occurred. After testing, the chemical
analysis of the bulk bismuth surrounding this alloy

showed only 10 ppm iron and <3 ppm germanium. The
Fe-Mo-C-B brazing alloys, 35M and 36M, showed only
slight attack. Figure 16.7 shows molybdenum brazed
with 35M, before and after test. The chemical analysis
of the bismuth surrounding 35M and 36M was 50 ppm
iron and 10 ppm iron respectively. However, after
handling, cracks were found in the joint brazed with
36M. Apparently the higher molybdenum concen-
tration in this alloy (25 vs 15% in 35M) increased the
brittleness of this joint.

These alloys are currently being tested in a quartz
loop circulating bismuth to determine their compati-
bility under mass transfer conditions.

16.5 COMPATIBILITY OF STRUCTURAL
MATERIALS WITH BISMUTH

O.B. Cavin L.R. Trotter

We have continued studying the compatibility of
potential structural materials and braze alloys with
bismuth in static tests and quartz thermal convection
loops operating at a maximum temperature of 700°C
and a AT of 95 + 5°C. The results of several quartz loop
tests are summarized in Table 16.1.

We have used several cleaning procedures to remove
the bismuth that adheres to the test samples after
draining the bismuth from the loop. In early tests some
of the samples were scratched while removing the
bismuth, and all of the bismuth was not always
removed. For these samples, weight changes may not be
an accurate measure of the effect of bismuth during

test. Recently we have found that the bismuth can be

removed effectively by amalgamating it for a short
period at 100°C and then removing the amalgam.
Previously we reported®* no significant attack of
molybdenum or TZM in contact with bismuth for 3000
hr. The weight changes and room-temperature me-
chanical properties of 0.020-in.-thick tensile samples are

* summarized in Table 16.2. The tensile properties. of
- exposed specimens were not significantly different from

as-received specimens. The microstructure control (heat
treated for 1 hr at 1500°C) and test samples are
compared -in Fig. 16.8. These specimens show no
significant effects of the bismuth exposure; however, a
layer of extremely fine grains is evident at the surface
of the molybdenum specimens, and these grains in some

~ cases were dislodged from the hot leg specimen after it

was etched for metallographic examination. When 100

in the bismuth was also noted (Table 16.3), and

dissolution of the tantalum sample by the bismuth. The
T-111 specimens appear relatively unaffected. In con.
trast, the mechanical properties of pure tantalum were
essentially unaffected, but T-111 was very brittle after
exposure to bismuth. Since increases of oxygen and
carbon in the T-111 were small (<100 ppm) and no

vacuum at 700°C to determine if an aging reaction
could be responsible for our observations.

Static capsule tests indicated that an Fe—5% Mo alloy
did not dissolve a detectable amount when tested in
bismuth at 650°C for 600 hr. To evaluate the resistance
of this alloy to mass transfer it was tested in flowing
bismuth (loop 9) at a maximum temperature of 700°C.
After 216 hr we observed that one of the samples in the
hot leg came loose and floated to the top of the
bismuth. A power failure after 423 hr caused termi-
nation of the test, and the only sample located in the
salvaged bismuth was the one that had floated to the
top. To explain why dissolution occurred in both hot
and cold leg portions of this loop, refer to Fig. 16.10,
which shows a schematic of the loop and sample
positions. The level of the bismuth in the cold leg was
approximately 3 in. above the upper inlet and was the
coldest portion of the loop. Material dissolved in the
hot leg could have precipitated in this area because of
supersaturation, and in the case of iron it would float
on the bismuth. The bismuth entering the cold leg

would, therefore, not be saturated and would continue
to dissolve ‘material in this region as well. Since the
power failure caused the bismuth to freeze, the quartz
loop material fractured, and the only uncontaminated
and recoverable bismuth was solidified in the top of the
cold leg. Analysis indicated that it contained, in
addition to bismuth, 13% iron and 0.018% molyb-
denum by weight as well as the other components
shown in Table 16.3.

From these results we can conclude that molybdenum
is still the most promising material for a chemical
processing structural material in contact with molten
bismuth at or below 700°C. The effect of bismuth
containing 100 ppm lithium on molybdenum is some-

195

what puzzling at this point. There is no reported
solubility of molybdenum in pure bismuth at this
temperature, and the solubility of molybdenum in pure
lithium has been reported as <1 ppm (limit of
detection) at 1320°C.> However, there has been evi-
dence of mass transfer of molybdenum in lithium when
another metal such as iron or niobium was present in
the system. It is also possible that lithium getters
oxygen in the system to an extent that promotes
wetting of the molybdenum by bismuth, thereby
enhancing the rate of dissolution and mass transfer. We
shall continue to study the effect of lithium in bismuth
on compatibility with molybdenum in a natural circula-
tion loop fabricated entirely of molybdenum. Speci-
mens will be included in both hot and cold leg regions,
and the lithium concentration of the bismuth will be
increased to 3 wt %.

16.6 CHEMICALLY VAPOR DEPOSITED
COATINGS

L.E.Poteat J.1. Federer

Since iron- and nickel-base alloys are attacked by
liquid bismuth, we are investigating the use of chem-
ically vapor deposited tungsten and molybdenum coat-
ings as barriers to corrosion. The coatings are being
applied by H, reduction of WF¢ and MoFs at about
600 and 900°C respectively.

We have continued to characterize tungsten coatings
on small sheet-type specimens, and the tungsten coating
process is being scaled up for components of practical
size and interest. The molybdenum coating process is
less advanced than that for tungsten coating; however,
the parameters for obtaining smooth coatings have been
determined.

16.6.1 Tungsten Coatings

Additional thermal cycling tests were conducted with
Hastelloy C, Inconel 600, and nickel-plated types 304
and 430 stainless steel specimens. Cracking of the
coating can occur during thermal cycling due to the
large difference in- thermal expansion between the
coating and the substrate, The average coefficient of
thermal expansion between 25 and 600°C ranges from

"11.2 to 18.5 pin. in.” °C”! for types 430 and 304

stainless steels, respectively, while that for tungsten is

only 4.6 pin. in.”! °C™'. Several 10 X % X Y% in.
specimens were coated with about 0.006 in. of tungsten
and then thermally cycled by alternate exposure to the
600°C zone and the 15°C water-cooled zone of a
furnace tube. Examination at a magnification of 3X
revealed no cracks. after five or ten cycles. After 25
cycles a dye-penetrant inspection did indicate a few
cracks in the coating on one end of the type 304
specimen, but the coatings on the other specimens were
uncracked.

Bond strengths between tungsten coatings and several
iron- and nickel-base alloys were further evaluated by
tensile tests. Specimens coated on both sides were
brazed between steel pull bars so that a tensile force
could be applied normal to the coating substrate
interface. The results of tensile tests are shown in
Table 16.4. Initially the cross-sectional area of most of
the specimens was about 0.56 in.2 (34 X % in.). This
resulted in an applied stress of 17,800 psi when the
maximum load of the tensile machine (10,000 1b) was
applied. If the specimen sustained this stress, its
cross-sectional area was decreased in steps until fracture
occurred. Inconel 600, Fe—35% Ni, and Fe—50% Ni
specimens sustained a stress of 33,300 psi without
fracture, although a second Inconel 600 specimen
subsequently failed at a lower stress (17,800 psi).
Hastelloy C was not tested to fracture; however, we
would expect a bond strength similar to the above
specimens. The type 304 and 430 stainless steel
specimens had bond strengths of about 22,000 psi.
However, our data are not sufficient to precisely
conclude what the bond strength is for a particular
coating-substrate combination, since bond strengths are
affected by the quality of the braze joint and by cracks
in the coating inadvertently caused by cutting the
specimens to size for the tests.

A method was developed for coating the inner wall
and bottom of 1%-in.-ID vessels so that the compati-
bility of the coating with liquid bismuth could be
determined. A water-cooled injector releases the H,-
WF¢ mixture near the bottom of the vessel while an
induction-heated zone (approx 600°C) traverses the
length of the vessel. A 0.005- to 0.007-in. coating was
applied to a nickel-plated type 405 vessel using this
technique. Subsequently the vessel contained static
bismuth for 667 hr at 600°C. Posttest examination
revealed no attack of the tungsten coating; however,
there were a few cracks in the coating, and the stainless
steel substrate was attacked in these areas. We suspect

that the cracks developed upon heating to the test
temperature, since a dye-penetrant inspection revealed
no cracks after coating. The bismuth was found to
contain about 100 ppm nickel after test.

We have coated the inner wall of 7; ¢-in.-ID stainless
steel tubes with a uniform 0.005-in.-thick coating over a
length of 4 ft using a technique that would be
applicable to lengths of 20 ft. The method consists in
moving the tube through a furnace while H, and WF,
flow through the inside of the tube. We have also
coated the inner surfaces of a 4%-in.-OD by 24-in.-long
vessel closed on both ends except for %-in.-OD tubing
penetrations. The coating was accomplished at 550°C in
a static hot zone.

These results and those previously reported show that
CVD tungsten coatings bond to nickel and nickel-base
alloys, Fe—35% Ni and Fe—50% Ni alloys, and nickel-
plated stainless steels. The coatings remain adherent
during thermal cycling and bend tests, and exhibit bond
strengths greater than 20,000 psi. The coating is

compatible with bismuth at 600°C, but cracks in the
coating may allow some corrosion of the base metal to
occur. We have demonstrated that the inner wall of
tubing can be uniformly coated over long lengths and
that vessels of practical size can be coated.

16.6.2 Molybdenum Coatings

The results of molybdenum coating experiments
indicate that the optimum gas mixture has an H, /MoFg
ratio of 3 to 6. At lower ratios severe reactions with the
substrate occur. At higher ratios the coatings are rough
textured and nonuniform in thickness. Smooth coatings
were obtained on Inconel 600 and Hastelloy C speci-
mens at about 900°C using an H,/MoFs ratio of 6.
Specimens have also been coated with about 0.005-in.-
thick tungsten and then coated with molybdenum. The
tungsten coating protected the substrates from attack
by MoFg, and a smooth molybdenum coating was
obtained.

We are presently preparing a small molybdenum-
coated vessel for a bismuth corrosion test, and we plan
to scale the coating process to vessels similar in size to
those coated with tungsten.

16.7 MOLYBDENUM DEPOSITION FROM MoF;
J. W. Koger

We have completed a second experiment to deposit
molybdenum on stainless steel by an exchange reaction

between MoF, and constituents of the stainless steel.
Gaseous MoF was dissolved to a level of 10 wt % in
molten LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %), and the solution was
allowed to react with the constituents of type 316
stainless steel at 700°C for SO hr. Metallographic
examination and microprobe analysis disclosed three
separate layers on the stainless steel. In some areas these
layers were quite adherent and in other areas were
easily removed. The outermost coating (0.1 mil thick)
was nickel. Next to the nickel there was a layer of
molybdenum metal (1.5 mils thick), and adhering to the
stainless steel there was a 2.5-mil layer of black fluoride
corrosion products. Results of a microprobe analysis of
the three layers are shown in Fig. 16.11.

The fluoride corrosion products (identified as fluo-
rides of Li, Be, Fe, and Cr) would appear to be largely
responsible for the nonadherence of the molybdenum
layer. After reaction the salt was removed from the
system. It was analyzed as LiF-BeF, (2:1 mole ratio)
with 5.4 wt % iron and 1.4 wt % chromium (approx-
imate ratio of iron to chromium in the stainless steel)
and very little nickel or molybdenum (ppm range).
Thus all the MoF, in the salt reacted with the stainless
steel, and the concentrations of iron and chromium
produced apparently exceeded the solubility limits of
the respective ions in the salt at 700°C.

Based on the results of this experiment, we plan to
evaluate deposition kinetics at a lower MoF¢ concen-
tration.

Part 5. Molten-Salt Processing and Preparation

M. E. Whatley

Part 5 deals with the development of processes for the
isolation of protactinium and the removal of fission
products from molten-salt reactors. During this report-
ing period we have continued to evaluate and develop a
new flowsheet based on fluorination—reductive extrac-
tion for protactinium isolation and the metal transfer
process for rare-earth removal. Calculations to deter-
mine the usefulness of this flowsheet continue to be
promising.

Additional data on the distribution of rare earths
between liquid bismuth solutions and molten LiCl
confirm that these materials distribute favorably. We
have shown that temperature does not markedly affect
distribution and that our previous extrapolation of
distribution data to conditions involving lithium con-
centrations in bismuth as high as 50 at. % appears to be
valid. Since contamination of the LiCl with fluoride
reduces the thorium-—rare-earth separation factor, the
fluoride concentrations will have to be kept below
about 2% in order to avoid discarding significant
quantities of thorium. Maintaining fluoride concentra-
tions at this level is considered to be practical.

Our work on contactor development was quite
successful during this reporting period. Flooding data
obtained during the countercurrent flow of bismuth
and molten salt in a 24-in.-long, 0.82-in.-ID column
packed with Y-in. molybdenum Raschig rings are in
good agreement with flooding rates predicted from

studies with mercury and water. These studies indicate
that the flow capacity of packed column contactors is
sufficiently high for use in MSBR processing systems.
Using the same column, we also demonstrated that
uranium can be extracted from molten salt by bismuth
containing reductants in a flow system. Greater than
95% of the uranium was extracted from a molten-salt
stream by countercurrent contact with a bismuth
stream.

Our efforts to develop a continuous fluorinator are
continuing; a relatively large continuous fluorination
experiment that will demonstrate protection against
corrosion by use of a layer of frozen salt is planned. A
simulated fluorinator system was installed for studying
heat generation and heat transfer in a system having the
geometry. to be used in the planned fluorination
experiment.

Our first engineering experiment for study of the
metal-transfer process for removing rare earths from
single-fluid MSBR fuel salt was completed. The rare
earths (lanthanum and neodymium) were extracted
from the fluoride salt at about the predicted rates, and
approximately 50% of the lanthanum and 25% of the
neodymium ‘were removed. The rare earths did not
collect in the lithium-bismuth solution as expected; we
believe that this was the result of oxide contamination
in the system. A second experiment, similar to the first,
is planned.

17. Flowsheet Analysis

M.J.Bell L.E.McNeese

A flowsheet that uses fluorination—reductive extrac-
tion and the metal transfer process for removing
protactinium and rare earths from the fuel salt of a
single-fluid MSBR has been described previously.
Calculations to identify the important operating param-

eters in the flowsheet and to determine optimum
operating conditions have been continued, The reactor

considered was a 2250-MW (thermal) single-fluid MSBR
containing 1683 ft> of fuel salt with a nominal
composition of 71.7-16.0-12.0-0.3 mole % "LiF-BeF,-
ThF 4-UF4. Chemical processing for both protactinium
and rare-earth removal was assumed to be on a ten-day
cycle.

Oxide precipitation is being considered as an alterna-
tive to fluorination for the removal of uranium from
fuel salt from which protactinium has already been
removed. Calculations have been made to investigate
the operation of an oxide precipitator.

17.1 PROTACTINIUM ISOLATION USING
FLUORINATION—-REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION

Calculations were made for selecting optimum operat-
ing conditions for the protactinium isolation system:
optimum conditions were tentatively assumed to be
those resulting in the minimum partial fuel cycle cost.
This cost includes the following components of the fuel
cycle cost which are associated with the isolation of
protactinium: (1) bismuth and uranium inventories in
the protactinium decay tank, (2) the loss in bred
uranium resulting from inefficient protactinium isola-
tion, (3) the cost of "Li reductant required to extract
uranium and protactinium from the fuel salt, and (4)
the cost of BeF, and ThF, which must be added to the
system in order to maintain a constant fuel salt
composition. A rate of 14% per annum was used to
compute inventory charges, and the cost of 233U was
taken to be $12/g. The following chemical costs were
used: bismuth, $5/Ib; ThF,, $6.50/1b; BeF,, $7.50/1b;
and "Li metal, $55/lb. The partial fuel cycle costs
which were obtained include only those charges that are
directly related to the isolation of protactinium and
include no contribution either for fluorination of. the
fuel salt to remove uranium or for removal of fission
products (notably zirconium) in the protactinium isola-
tion system.

The effect of the number of equilibrium stages in the
extraction columns above and below the protactinium
decay tank on the partial fuel cycle cost is shown in
Fig. 17.1. In the final selection of the number of stages
for these columns, one must also consider the cost
associated with an increased number of stages. A
selection of two stages below and five stages above the
protactinium decay tank has been made, since a larger
number of stages results in only a small decrease in cost.
For a reductant feed rate of 429 equivalents/day and a
thorium concentration in the bismuth entering the
column equal to 90% of the thorium solubility at
640°C, the bismuth-to-salt flow ratio in the columns is

.

0.14. The required column diameter is 3 in. if the
column is packed with %-in. molybdenum Raschig
rings.

The effects of the reductant addition rate and changes
in the volume of the protactinium decay tank on the
partial fuel cycle cost are shown in Fig. 17.2. The
capital cost of the decay tank, a relatively expensive
equipment item, will also influence the final choices for
the tank volume and the reductant feed rate; however,
this cost has not yet been taken into consideration.
Values of 161 ft* for the decay tank volume and 429
equivalents of reductant per day have been selected as
optimum values. Decreasing the reductant addition rate
from 429 equivalents/day to 400 equivalents/day
reduces the partial fuel cycle cost by 2% while
increasing the inventory charge on bismuth in the decay
tank by about 5%.

The effect of the operating temperature on the
performance of the protactinium isolation system, as
shown by changes in partial fuel cycle cost, is given in

Fig. 17.3. A minimum partial fuel cycle cost of 0.0453

mill/kWhr is observed at a temperature of 640°C for a
column having two stages below and five stages above
the protactinium decay tank, a decay tank volume of
161 ft>, and a reductant addition rate of 429 equiva-
lents/day. These conditions, which have been chosen as
the reference processing conditions, result in a protac-

ThF, addition, 0.0163 mill/kWhr.

17.2 RARE-EARTH REMOVAL USING
THE METAL TRANSFER PROCESS

Calculations have been continued to show the impor-
tance of several variables in the metal transfer process.
The quantity that was used as a measure of reactor
performance was the breeding gain (breeding ratio
minus 1). Figure 17.4 shows the effect of the number
of stages in the fuel-salt—bismuth and the LiCl-bismuth
contactors, which have an equal number of stages.
Little benefit is realized from using more than three
stages in each contactor, and three stages are considered
optimum,

The effects of the bismuth and LiCl flow rates are
shown in Fig. 17.5. A substantial increase in the
breeding gain is obtained by increasing the bismuth
flow rate from 8.3 to 12.4 gpm; however, further

increases in the flow rate do not produce corresponding
gains in reactor performance. The reactor performance
is relatively insensitive to increases in the LiCl flow rate
above 33 gpm. Bismuth and LiCl flow rates of 12.4 and
33 gpm have been selected for the reference processing
conditions. At a bismuth flow rate of 12.4 gpm, the
metal-to-salt flow ratio in the fuel-salt—bismuth contac-
tor is 14.1. The column will be packed with %-in.
Raschig rings and will be 13 in, in diameter. The
LiCl-bismuth contactor, which will also be packed with
!, -in, Raschig rings, is 12 in, in diameter.

The presence of fluoride in the LiCl acceptor salt
causes a significant decrease in the thorium distribution
coefficient. As a result an increase in the rate at which
thorium transfers to the LiCl is observed as the LiF
content in the LiCl is increased. This is undesirable
since the thorium is subsequently extracted, along with
rare earths, from the LiCl into the lithium-bismuth
solutions and is subsequently discarded. As shown in
Fig. 17.6, the thorium transfer rate increases from 0.41
‘molefday with no LiF in the acceptor salt to 280
moles/day when the acceptor salt contains 5 mole %
LiF. It is likely that the LiF concentration in the LiCl
will have to be kept below about 2 mole %, which
corresponds to a thorium transfer rate of 7.7
moles/day. Discard of thorium at this rate would add

the presence of fluoride in the LiCl on the removal of
rare earths is negligible; in fact, the rare-earth removal
efficiency increases slightly as the fluoride concentra-
tion in the LiCl increases.

17.3 REMOVAL OF URANIUM FROM FUEL SALT
BY OXIDE PRECIPITATION

Oxide precipitation is being considered as an alterna-
tive to fluorination for removal of uranium from fuel
salt from which protactinium has already been re-

moved. Calculations have been made for an oxide

precipitation method that consists in countercurrently
contacting the fuel salt with a UO, -ThO, solid solution
in a precipitator, which results in a specified number of
equilibrium contacts (stages) between the molten salt
and the oxide precipitate. It was assumed that the oxide
is initially produced by precipitating a specified number
of moles of oxide per mole of salt fed to the last stage:
(i.c., the stage in which the salt has the lowest UF,

»
 

ad

concentration). The oxide initially precipitated is
largely ThO, ; however, after subsequent contact with
salt having higher UF, concentrations (in remaining
stages of the precipitator), the oxide becomes princi-
pally UO,. A computer program was written that
calculates the concentration profiles in the precipitator;
temperature, the number of stages, the number of
moles of oxide precipitated per mole of salt fed, and
the number of moles of salt remaining with the oxide
during the transfer of salt are the independent variables.
The equilibrium data of Bamberger and Baes® for
U0, -ThO, solid solutions in contact with fuel salt were
employed.

203

Typical results showing the effects of temperature’

and number of stages on system performance are shown
in Fig. 17.7. The results indicate that greater than 99%
of the uranium can be removed from MSBR fuel salt
with relatively few stages and that the oxide stream
produced will have a UO, concentration of greater than
90%. A decrease in performance is observed with
increasing temperature. The amount of salt remaining
with the oxide during the transfer of salt was varied
from 2 to 10 moles of salt per mole of oxide without a
significant effect on precipitator performance.

18. Measurement of Distribution Coefficients in
Molten-Salt-Metal Systems

L. M. Ferris

Studies relating to the development of the metal
transfer process!» for the removal of rare earths from
MSBR fuel salt were continued. The major effort
involved measuring the effect of temperature on the
equilibrium distribution of various elements between
liquid bismuth solutions and either molten LiCl or LiBr.
In addition, distribution coefficient data were obtained
for europium and promethium using LiCI-LiF salt
solutions. Studies of the solubilities of rare earths in
lithium-bismuth solutions of high lithium concentration
and of the solubility of LaOCl in molten LiCl were
initiated.

Uranium and protactinium must be isolated from
MSBR fuel salt before the metal transfer process can be
utilized for rare-earth removal. One isolation technique
being evaluated® consists in fluorination of the salt to
remove the uranium as UF4, followed by reductive
extraction to isolate the protactinium, We have also
been considering an alternative method in which protac-
tinium and uranium would be selectively precipitated
from the salt as oxides, leaving the rare earths in
solution. Experimentation on oxide precipitation proc-
esses has just begun.

log Kp was 0.06 or less; exceptions are noted in Table
18.1. Plots of log Kf; vs 1/7, using data obtained with
several elements, were found to be linear over the
temperature range of about 625 to 750°C (Fig. 18.2);
thus for each element the temperature dependence of
log Ky could be expressed as log Ky =A + B/T. Values
of A and B for several elements, obtained with either
LiCl or LiBr as the salt phase, are given in Table 18.2.
These data confirm earlier indications’ that the distri-
bution behavior of most elements is rather insensitive to
temperature changes and that the distribution coeffi-
cients for a given element at a given temperature are
about the same with LiCl and LiBr. A detailed analysis
of the effect of temperature on the metal transfer
process has not yet been made.

An experiment was performed to determine qualita-
tively the behavior of zirconium in the metal transfer
process. Zirconium tetrachloride (enough to make the
salt 1 wt % in zirconium), along with about 1 mCi of
95Zr tracer, was mixed with about 50 g of LiCl and 300
g of bismuth in a molybdenum apparatus. The two-
phase system was treated with HCI-H, (80-20 mole %)
for 3 hr at 650°C to dissolve the zirconium in the salt
phase. During this period about 50% of the zirconium

was volatilized from the system. After hydrochlorina-
tion, sufficient thorium and lithium-bismuth alloy were
added. to the system to give a bismuth solution
containing about 1500 wt ppm of thorium and 15 wt
ppm of lithium. The system was maintained under an
argon atmosphere for two weeks, with samples of both
the salt and bismuth phases being withdrawn period-
ically. The zirconium distribution coefficients calcu-
lated from chemical analyses of the samples were
scattered between 10 and 230; the average value was 85
when the mole fraction of lithium in the bismuth phase
was 4.5 X 10™* (15 wt ppm). This distribution
coefficient is about the same as that obtained with
LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) at the same lithium
concentration in the bismuth phase. Consequently, if
zirconium has not been removed from the salt with
either the protactinium or uranium, it will be extracted
along with the rare earths in the metal transfer process.

During the two weeks that the system was maintained
at 650°C, the zirconium concentration in the LiCl and
bismuth phases did not decrease detectably. In addi-
tion, no increase in °5Zr activity was detected in the

colder regions of the apparatus, where condensation of

volatilized zirconium compounds might be expected to
occur. These observations indicate that the partial
pressure of zirconium tetrachloride above the LiCl
solution in contact with bismuth containing reductants
was much lower than that predicted from the vapor
pressure of pure ZrCl,. This could be an indication that
the oxidation state of the zirconium species in the salt
was lower than 4*.

The main feature of the metal transfer process is the
selective transport of rare earths from a fluoride fuel
salt into an LiCl or LiBr acceptor salt. In one flowsheet
being considered’ the rare earths would be stripped

from the acceptor salt by extraction into lithium.
bismuth solutions having lithium concentrations of 5 at.
% or higher. More specifically, the trivalent rare earths
(and the small amount of thorium that would also be
present in the acceptor salt) would be extracted into
liquid lithium-bismuth (5-95 at. %), and the divalent
rare earths (europium and samarium) would be ex-
tracted into liquid lithium-bismuth (about 40-60 at. %).
In the analysis of the flowsheet,! it was assumed that
the values of log K}; obtained with bismuth solutions
of low lithium concentration were also valid when the
lithium concentration in the bismuth phase was 5 at. %
or higher. This assumption appears to be warranted,
based on the results of the experiment at 650°C in
which europium was extracted from LiCl into lithium-
bismuth solutions having lithium concentrations of 10
to 35 at. % (Table 18.1, Fig. 18.1). The value of log
Kt, obtained in this experiment (2.325) is in good
agreement with the value of 2.28 expected from the
correlation (Table 18.2) of the europium distribution
coefficients obtained previously. In the earlier experi-
ments the lithium concentration in the bismuth phase
was always lower than about 1 at. %.

The distribution behavior of several solutes, using
LiCI-LiF and LiBr-LiF solutions as the salt phase, is
being studied to determine the effect of fluoride on the
metal transfer process in the event that the acceptor salt
becomes contaminated with fluoride fuel salt. It was
shown previously? that the presence of fluoride in
either LiCl or LiBr caused a change in the distribution
behavior of lanthanum and thorium, particularly
thorium. Recently we obtained some data for pro-
methium and europium, using LiCI-LiF solutions as the
salt phase (Table 18.3). At 640°C the values of log Kp,
decreased systematically as the LiF concentration in the

salt phase increased. This behavior is similar to that
found previously for lanthanum, and shows that the
thorium-promethium separation factor will also be
decreased if the acceptor salt becomes contaminated
with fuel salt. No value for log Kp, was obtained with
pure LiCl as the salt phase; however, the estimated
value of 8.4 indicates that the behavior of promethium
is similar to that of neodymium. The estimated
neodymium-promethium separation factor at 640°C
with pure LiCl as the salt phase is 3 + 2. Furthermore,
this separation factor is not expected to change
significantly with temperature because the values of log
K§,, obtained with LiCI-LiF (97.55-2.45 mole %) had
about the same temperature dependence as the values
of log KT , and log KY4 obtained with LiCl as the salt
phase; that is, the values of B were of the same
magnitude (Table 18.2).

As shown in Table 18.3, the values for log Kf. at
650°C showed a slight increase when LiF was present in
the salt phase. The magnitude of the change is such that
contamination of the acceptor salt with fluoride would
not markedly affect the behavior of europium in the
metal transfer process.

18.2 SOLUBILITY OF NEODYMIUM IN Li-Bi-Th
SOLUTIONS

 F.LSmith  C.T. Thompson

As mentioned in Sect. 18.1, one method for removing
rare earths and thorium from an LiCl or LiBr acceptor
salt in the metal transfer process is extraction into
lithium-bismuth solutions in which the lithium concen-

tration is 5 at. % or higher. Consequently we are
investigating the solubilities, both individual and mu-
tual, of rare earths and thorium in lithium-bismuth
solutions. In our first experiment the solubility of
neodymium in liquid lithium-bismuth (~38-62 at. %)
was measured over the temperature range 475 to
700°C. The experiment was initiated by heating
bismuth, neodymium, and lithium (about 186, 10, and
4 g respectively) in a molybdenum crucible under argon
to 475°C and maintaining the system at this tempera-
ture for 24 hr before sampling the liquid phase. The
temperature of the system was then increased progres-
sively to 700°C; after reaching 700°C the temperature
of the system was lowered incrementally to 475°C. At
least 4 hr was allowed at each temperature for the
attainment of equilibrium before a filtered sample of
the liquid phase was removed for analysis. Flame
photometric analyses of the samples indicated a vari-
ation in lithium concentration between about 1.9 and
2.2 wt % during the experiment; the average lithium
concentration was 2.0 wt %, which corresponds to 38
at. % in the liquid phase. The results of neutron
activation analyses of the samples for neodymium are
shown in Fig. 18.3 as a plot of logo § (Wt %

effect in this plot indicates that equilibrium was
attained at each temperature. The solubility data can be
expressed as log; o S (wt ppm neodymium) = 6.257 —
1809/T (°K). As seen in Fig. 18.3, these values are
considerably higher than the reported solubility of
neodymium in pure bismuth.’

Following the determination of neodymium solubil-
ities, about 1 g of thorium was added to the system.
Analyses of filtered samples showed that at 650°C the
solubility of thorium in liquid Li-Bi-Nd (38.0-61.1-0.9
at. %) was less than 15 wt ppm. For comparison, the
solubility of thorium in liquid bismuth at 650°C is
about 3500 wt ppm.®

18.3 SOLUBILITY OF LaOCI IN MOLTEN LiQ
F.J. Smith C.T. Thompson

A study of the reactions and of the relative stabilities
of lanthanide and thorium halides, oxides, and oxy-
halides in molten LiCl and LiBr has been initiated.
Lanthanide and thorium halides that are dissolved in
these potential acceptor salts for the metal transfer
process can possibly react with oxygen-containing
impurities (such as water vapor) in an argon or helium
cover gas to yield unwanted insoluble products. Our
initial work was done with LaOCl that had been
prepared by the thermal decomposition of LaCl;-6H, 0
in air at 750°C following the procedure given by
Wendlandt.” X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that
the product was pure LaOCl; no La, 0; or residual
LaCl; was detected. Chemical analysis of the LaOCl
gave the following results: La, 72.7 wt %; Cl, 18.2 wt %.
These results compare favorably with the corresponding
calculated values, 73.0 and 18.6%. Some of the
powdered LaOCl was contacted with molten LiCl under
argon at about 640°C for 144 hr. The system did not
change visibly during this period. Finally, two filtered
samples of the liquid phase were taken; chemical
analysis showed their lanthanum concentrations to be
50 and 73 wt ppm respectively. These results indicate
that the solubility of LaOCl in molten LiCl is very low
and that LaOCl apparently will not decompose into
LaCl; and La,O; to any appreciable extent in the .
presence of molten LiCL

18.4 OXIDE PRECIPITATION STUDIES
J.C.Mailen J.F.Land

Results of recent work by Baes, Bamberger, and Ross
(Sect. 10.5) indicate that protactinium dissolved in
MSBR fuel salt could be almost completely oxidized to
Pa** by treatment of the salt. with an HF-H, mixture
and that the protactinium could be precipitated selec-
tively, probably as pure Pa, 05, by adding oxide to a
salt containing Pa®*. Earlier work by Bamberger and
Baes® defined the equilibria between molten LiF-BeF,-
ThF, solutions and UO,-ThO, solid solutions. Their
data indicate that under certain conditions most of the
uranium could be precipitated from the salt with the
attendant precipitation of only a small amount of
thorium. These results have led us to consider oxide
‘precipitation methods (instead of fluorination and
reductive extraction) as means for isolating both protac-
tinium and uranium from MSBR fuel salt. Once these
elements are isolated, the salt would be suitable for use
as feed for the metal transfer process, in which rare
earths would be removed. The flowsheet we are
considering would be approximately as follows: (1) Salt
from the reactor would be treated with an HF-H,-H, 0
gas mixture to convert most of the protactinium to Pa®*
and to precipitate a large fraction of the protactinium
as Pa,0;5. (2) The Pa, 05; would be removed contin-
uously by centrifugation or other suitable means. (3)

- Most of the protactinium-free salt would be returned to

the reactor; however, a side stream would be diverted to
a metal transfer system for removal of the rare-earth
fission products. (4) Uranium (and a small amount of
thorium) would be precipitated from the salt fed to the
metal transfer system by reaction of dissolved UF, and
ThF, with water vapor. (5) The UO, (and attendant
ThO,) precipitated in this step would be isolated by
centrifugation (or other means) and then would be
redissolved by hydrofluorination in fluoride salt that
had been depleted in rare earths in the metal transfer
process. We have just begun experimentation on oxide
precipitation processes. Preliminary calculations relating
to the stagewise precipitation of uranium oxide have
been made.

Our first protactinium oxide precipitation experiment
was conducted as follows: About 100 g of LiF-BeF,-
ThF,-UF, (71.7-16-12-0.3 mole %) containing 100 wt
ppm of 23!Pa along with 232Pa tracer was treated at
600°C, first for 24 hr with HF-H, (50-50 mole %) and

then for 24 hr with HF-H, (80-20 mole %). Residual
HF and H, were removed by sparging with pure argon.
Then UO, microspheres were periodically added to the
system in small amounts (~10 mg). The total amount
of UO, added was insufficient to saturate the salt with
oxide. After each addition of UO,, the system was left
undisturbed at 600°C for at least 24 hr before a filtered
sample of the salt was removed for analysis. After
several samples had been withdrawn at 600°C, the
temperature of the system was increased to 655°C and
another sample was obtained.

The results of this experiment (Table 18.4) showed
that the protactinium concentration in the salt de-
creased systematically as UO, was added to the system
at 600°C. Values of the solubility product, Kg, =
(Xpas+) (Xga-)?-%, in which X denotes mole fraction,
were calculated from the data assuming that: (1) the
protactinium species in the salt was pentavalent after
hydrofluorination, (2) the solid phase formed was pure

Pa, 0s, (3) the oxide content of the salt after hydro- -

fluorination was practically zero, (4) the UO, micro-
spheres dissolved in the melt, and (5) equilibrium was
established in each case. Analyses of three samples
taken at 600°C yielded log Kg, = —15.5, whereas the
value of log K;, obtained at 655°C was about —14.9
(Table 18.4). Solubility products are not given for
samples 5 and 6 because of the inaccuracy of the
protactinium analyses. It should be noted that the
presence of some oxide in the system initially would
make the true values of log Kp less negative than the
values actually obtained.

Uranium analyses of samples taken at 600°C showed
that no more than 5% of the uranium could have been
precipitated along with the protactinium oxide. How-
ever, since the solid phase could not be isolated and

analyzed, we could not prove that the solid phase was
pure Pa,0;5 (as we assumed). It was obvious, on the
other hand, that the technique employed did result in
the preferential precipitation of protactinium.
Calculations were made, using the equilibrium data
reported by Bamberger and Baes® for the exchange of
U* and Th** between molten LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, and
(U-Th)O, solid solutions, in order to investigate pos-
sible modes of operation for the selective precipitation
of UO, from MSBR fuel salt by reaction with water
vapor. The initial fuel salt was taken to be LiF-BeF,-
ThF,-UF, (71.7-16-12-0.3 mole %). It was assumed
that when water vapor was allowed to contact the salt
at 600° a UO,-ThO, solid solution was produced and
that the solid was in equilibrium with the resulting
liquid salt. In a single equilibrium stage, about 29% of
the thorium would have to be precipitated in order to
remove 99% of the uranium (Table 18.5). This amount
of thorium is probably prohibitively large. As shown in
Table 18.6, the uranium can be precipitated more
selectively by making successive equilibrium precipita-

tions. For the case given in Table 18.6, in which 90% of
the uranium present in the liquid is precipitated in each
stage, a total of only about 4.5% of the thorium would
accompany 99% of the uranium in two successive
stages. Other calculations have indicated that, in
principle, the best mode of operation would involve the
countercurrent contact of molten salt with solid oxide
phases. In a countercurrent system containing about

210

three equilibrium stages, 99% of the uranium could be
removed from the salt, and the amount of thorium in
the ThO,-UO, solid phase exiting from the system
would correspond to less than 1% of the thorium
present in the fuel salt. The results of the calculations
presented above illustrate that uranium can be removed
from MSBR fuel salt without the attendant precipita-
tion of a large fraction of the thorium.

We have continued our experimental work in the

tion consisted in installing a column packed with  -in.

-10, and -11) in which bismuth and molten salt were
countercurrently contacted were made with the new
column. The resulting flooding data are compared in
Fig. 19.1 with values predicted from a flooding correla-
tion developed from studies with a mercury-water
system. The agreement between the measured and
predicted values is good in that points obtained under
nonflooded conditions lie below the predicted flooding
curve and points obtained under flooded conditions lie
above or close to the flooding curve. This is particularly
important because it indicates that simulated systems,
such as the mercury-water system, can be used to
develop correlations applicable to bismuth—molten-salt
systems. Such: correlations aid in the planning and
analysis of experiments using molten salt and bismuth
and facilitate development of the technology required
for designing and operating salt-metal systems.

The final hydrodynamic experiment (HR-12) was
carried out to measure pressure drop through the
column when only salt was flowing through it. Since
only a small pressure drop was expected, it was
necessary that the bismuth-salt interface at the bottom
of the column be depressed below the salt inlet. This
was accomplished by routing the argon off-gas flow
through a mercury seal to pressurize the top of the
column, the salt overflow sampler, and the salt receiver.
Observed pressure drops through the column were 2,
2.5, and § in. H,O at salt flow rates of 68, 127, and
244 ml/min respectively; values predicted by the Ergun
 

 

212

equation® for these flow rates were 0.5, 1, and 2 in.
H,O respectively. These measurements indicate that
little if any iron deposition has occurred in the column.
Additional measurements will be made to detect pos-
sible iron deposition.

In preparation for the first mass transfer run (UTR-1),
a sufficient quantity of LiF-UF,; eutectic mixture was
added to the salt feed tank to produce a uranium
concentration of 0.0003 mole fraction, and thorium
metal was added to the bismuth in the treatment vessel.
Hydrodynamically, run UTR-1 was successful. A uni-
form flow rate of each phase was maintained at 105
ml/min (~62% of flooding) for 90 min; during this
period seven sets of simultaneous samples (salt out,
bismuth out) were taken from the flowing stream
samplers. The flow rates were then increased to 129
ml/min (~76% of flooding) for 50 min. Surprisingly,
however, analyses of flowing bismuth samples showed
that only a small fraction (0.5%) of the uranium was

extracted from the salt phase. Subsequent investigation

showed that a cube of thorium metal had blocked the
charging port in the treatment vessel and that there was
essentially no reductant in the bismuth phase during the
experiment.

In preparation for the next mass transfer run, thorium
metal was added directly to the bismuth feed tank.
Dissolution of the thorium was slow, requiring a total
of about 300 hr (including 120 hr at 650°C). The
bismuth was then held in the feed tank at 540°C until
the run (a period of about four days). The thorium
concentration in the bismuth that was fed to the
extraction column (determined by chemical analysis)
was 580 ppm, which is only about 60% of the
calculated thorium solubility at 540°C.

Operating conditions and results for run UTR-2 are
summarized in Table 19.1. Greater than 95% of the
uranium was extracted into the bismuth phase, which
initially contained a 140% stoichiometric excess of
reductant. Conditions for the experiment were chosen
such that a relatively large fraction of the uranium
would be extracted, although these conditions are not
optimum for the determination of mass transfer per-
formance. This. experiment was important in that it
demonstrated the reductive extraction of uranium in a
flow system. Subsequent experiments will be carried
out with extraction factors near unity rather than with
the much higher values used in the first experiment.

The failure of mild steel components and transfer
lines in the facility diminished to the level of a minor
problem. The earlier use of Markal CR paint on all

newly installed components appears to have reduced
the rate of air oxidation of the steel surfaces. The only
failure due to air oxidation occurred in a short length of
tubing, installed during the construction of the facility,
that was not coated with protective paint. Following
the second mass transfer run, failures in transfer lines
were noted at two points: (1) in the salt line entering
the bottom of the column and (2) in the bismuth line
leaving the bottom of the column. Both failures

* apparently resulted from the expansion of freezing

bismuth. Neither air oxidation of the outer surface nor
mass transfer of iron from the inner surface appeared to
have been contributing factors. The implication of these
observations is that in future operations an attempt
should be made to minimize the number of freeze-thaw
cycles at the expense of increasing the length of time
the lines are held at an elevated temperature (~600°C).

19.2 DESIGN OF A PROCESSING MATERIALS
TEST STAND AND THE MOLYBDENUM
REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION EQUIPMENT

W. F. Schaffer, Jr.  E. L. Nicholson
J. Roth

The basic plans for the test stand and the molyb-
denum reductive extraction equipment were described
in the last semiannual report." No major changes have
been made in the conceptual design. A report describing
the conceptual design is being prepared.

Welding and brazing have been selected as the
methods for assembling the molybdenum vessels and
piping. The field assembly of process lines using
portable inert gas welding and brazing chambers must
still be demonstrated. One or more mechanical cou-
plings may be included in the test stand for convenience
and experience if a suitable one can be developed.

Bo

Design studies to date have been based on piping
assembly by mechanical couplings, since they are
limiting for nozzle spacing requirements and vessel
supports. However, no major changes in layout will be
required for the use of welded and brazed connections,
and some simplification of vessel supports may be
possible when the final design is prepared.

A conceptual fullsize layout of the test stand and
molybdenum equipment was prepared for use in deter-
mining clearances and vessel nozzle and line orientation.
A Y;-scale model of the molybdenum portions of the
test stand, including piping and the equipment support
column, was completed as an additional visual aid for
design and fabrication studies.

Conceptual drawings were prepared for equipment
hangers that slide on and are guided by a vertical
stainless steel column. The hangers are supported from
the cover of the containment vessel by molybdenum
rods to compensate for the differential expansion
between the molybdenum equipment and the stainless
steel column. The hangers are designed to resist torque
imparted to vessels during assembly if mechanical
connectors are used and will also tolerate some mis-
alignment of vessels and piping during assembly.

A preliminary design drawing for the head pots has
been prepared, based on the use of molybdenum
back-extrusion forgings (essentially forged pipe caps).
These forgings will have a finished outside diameter of
3% in. and an inside diameter of 3% in. with an inside
straight side length of about 2 in. The forged com-
ponents for the head pots and the packed-column end
sections will have the same basic dimensions to mini-
mize extrusion press die costs. The forgings may have
either thick ends or one or more integral forged end
bosses that can be machined to permit the use of
mechanical couplings or welded and brazed connections
for process lines. The head pot design incorporates a
mechanical assembly method for the internal baffles
and orifice components. The design illustrates electron

‘beam welding, reinforced by furnace back-brazing

techniques, to attach the lines to the vessel and to join
the top and bottom forgings. External circumferential
welds on vessels and tubing will be reinforced with a
brazed molybdenum band or sleeve.

A full-scale transparent plastic model of the bismuth
head pot, the top disengagement section of the column,
and a portion of the packed section of the column was
fabricated ‘and installed for testing with mercury and
water to simulate molten bismuth and salt. Problems to
be investigated include head pot deentrainment per-
formance for the gas-lift-pumped bismuth stream, bis-
muth flow surge damping, bismuth distributor design

213

for the top of the packed column, and entrainment of
bismuth in the salt stream exiting from the top section
of the column.

A gas pulse pump using tungsten carbide check valves
in the pipe line has been designed and installed for
testing as a possible alternative to the gas-lift pumps
proposed for the test stand. Possible advantages over
gaslift pumping are: a wider flow range capability,
elimination of gas entrainment problems, and reduced
consumption of inert gas. In the first tests the pulsed
actuating gas pressure will be supplied by a variable-
frequency cam-actuated air valve. Subsequent testing
will investigate a sealed gas cushion pulsed by a bellows
or piston.

We are continuing the investigation of mechanical
cor ting (see Chap. 16). The Gamah coupling supplied
to use earlier leaked at the seal ring after a few
temperature cycles. Failure may have been due to the
high-temperature relaxation of the stainless steel nut on
the fitting or to severe oxidation of the joint before it
was received. The swaged joints between the tubing and
coupling hubs have shown no signs of leakage. A new
Gamah coupling made entirely of molybdenum has
been received. It, along with several other couplings,
will be subjected to high-temperature (650°C) cyclic
leak testing.

19.3 CONTACTOR DEVELOPMENT: PRESSURE
DROP, HOLDUP, AND FLOODING
IN PACKED COLUMNS

J.S. Watson L. E. McNeese

We are studying the hydrodynamics of packed-
column operation with fluids having high densities and
a large density difference in order that we may evaluate
and design countercurrent contactors for use in MSBR -
processing systems based on reductive extraction.
Mercury and water are being used to simulate bismuth

~and molten salt in these studies. We previously re-

ported* measurements of flooding, dispersed-phase
holdup, and pressure drop for columns packed with
Y,-in. Raschig rings and solid cylinders and %-in.
Raschig rings.

During this report period, measurements of pressure
drop and dispersed-phase holdup were carried out with
a 2-4n.-ID column packed with %,-in. Raschig rings. The
holdup data were similar to those obtained previously
with smaller packing materials; the results can be

where V, and V,; are superficial velocities of the
continuous and dispersed phases, respectively, and X is
the fraction of the column void fraction occupied by
the dispersed phase. Fifty-nine holdup measurements
were made with the %-in. Raschig ring packing. The
calculated superficial slip velocity was 1531 + 249 ft/hr.

The superficial slip velocities for packings studied
previously were also calculated, and standard deviations
of 10 to 15% (estimated to be the experimental error in
the holdup data) were observed. The data for %-in.
Raschig rings and solid cylinders in 1- and 2-in.-ID
columns suggest® that the superficial slip velocity is also
expected to be dependent on packing size and that
although the slip velocity for %-in. Raschig rings (i.e.,
819 ft/hr) is approximately equal to that for Y%-in.
Raschig rings, the slip velocity for %-in. Raschig rings
(1531 ft/hr) is considerably higher than that for smaller
packing.

The observation that the dispersed-phase holdup data

. can be correlated on the basis of a constant superficial

slip velocity is especially important, since this suggests a
method for correlating flooding data. At flooding it is
assumed that the following conditions obtain:

—2-—L=0. ©

If the superficial slip velocity remains constant up to
flooding, combining Eqs. (1) and (2) yields the relation:

(Ve loo)? + (Va m100a) 2 = V5, 3)

where V; 1604 and Vj 00a are the continuous- and
dispersed-phase superficial velocities at flooding. Thus a
plot of (V, f100a)*/? vs (V4 f1004)*/? should produce
a straight line having a slope of —1. This has been
observed in the literature,® and our previous flooding
data with %-in. and %-in. Raschig rings and %; -in. solid
cylinders are well represented by this correlation. It was

not possible to flood the column packed with %-in.
Raschig rings because of insufficient capacities in the
mercury and! water pumping systems, although the
column appeared to be approaching flooding at the
highest flow rates used. Hence it was not possible to
verify experimentally that the slip velocity, as calcu-
lated from holdup measurements, is equal to the value
that would be determined from flooding data.

To date, our attempts to correlate pressure drop data
have not been successful. The pressure drop behavior is
especially complex at low water flow rates, where the
pressure drop observed with water flow is actually
lower than observed with no water flow. Since this is
contrary to our expectations, we are continuing to
study the phenomenon.

We have attempted to extend the correlations
developed for the mercury-water system in order to
obtain relations that are applicable to molten-salt—
bismuth systems. The physical properties of the fluids
were not varied in these studies, and there are signifi-
cant differences in properties between the mercury-
water system and molten-salt—bismuth systems. The
most important ones were considered to be the vis-
cosity of the continuous phase and the difference in
densities of the phases. The slip velocity is assumed to

‘be directly proportional to the difference in the

densities of the phases. The correction for changes in
interfacial tension is believed to be small since the
interfacial tension for the mercury-water system is
approximately equal to that for a molten-salt—bismuth
system. The interaction of the dispersed phase with the
continuous phase is expected to be inertial in nature,
and the continuous-phase viscosity should have only a
slight effect.

On the basis of these considerations and the data
discussed earlier, the superficial slip velocity for a given
packing size was assumed to be proportional to both
the packing void fraction and the difference in densities
of the phases. The. resulting relation for the flooding
rates in a salt-bismuth system is then

19.4 CONTACTOR DEVELOPMENT: AXIAL
MIXING IN PACKED COLUMNS

J.S. Watson LL. E. McNeese

We have continued our measurements of axial disper-
sion in packed columns during the countercurrent flow
of fluids having high densities and a large density
difference. The experimental technique, described pre-
viously,” consists in making photometric measurements
to show the steady-state concentration profile of cupric
nitrate tracer in the continuous (aqueous) phase along
the length of the column. These experiments, which use
mercury and water, are intended to simulate conditions
in packed columns through which bismuth and molten
salt are in countercurrent flow. Results were reported
previously for a 2-in-ID column packed with %-in.
Raschig rings. Figure 19.2 provides a comparison of the
data obtained during this reporting period for %-in.

In each case the axial dispersion coefficient was

Dispersion coefficients for ¥%- and Y%-in. packing were
also independent of the continuous-phase (water) flow
rate; their values were 3.5 and 4.8 cm? [sec respectively.
Data for the %-in. packing indicate that the dispersion
coefficient is inversely proportional to the continuous-
phase flow rate. Differences between the dispersion
coefficients for the two Y-in. packing materials are
probably related to the difference in the packing void
fractions of the materials. The data appear to portray
two types of behavior, one for ';-in. packing and one
for larger packing.

Axial dispersion coefficient data obtained during
countercurrent flow of liquids having low densities and
small differences in densities in columns packed with
materials that are wet by the liquids are reported in the
literature. Data of Vermeulen,” Moon, Hennico, and
Miyauchi® suggest that, for conditions corresponding to
the present studies, the dispersion coefficient should be
proportional to the quantity

where
€ = packing void fraction,
d = packing diameter,
V4 = superficial velocity of the dispersed phase,

V,. = superficial velocity of the continuous phase.

The data obtained in the present study are not in
agreement with the predicted dependence on flow rates.
However, it should be noted that the conditions of the
present study are significantly different from those for
which the reported correlation was developed. Lack of
agreement is not surprising, since similar differences in
behavior have been observed previously between the
mercury-water system and aqueous-organic systems.

19.5 AXIAL MIXING IN OPEN BUBBLE COLUMNS
J.S. Watson L. E. McNeese .

Axial mixing is important in the design of continuous
fluorinators, which are envisioned as open columns
through which fluorine is bubbled countercurrent to a
flow of molten salt. We have previously reported
data®'® showing the variation of dispersion coefficient
with changes in gas and liquid flow rates and with the
physical properties of the liquid.

Additional data showing the importance of column
diameter and gas inlet diameter have been obtained in a
study by Jeje and Bozzuto, of the MIT Practice
School,'! who used an air-water system. The experi-
mental technique, discussed previously,” consisted in
measuring the concentration profile of a tracer along
the length of the column. Results obtained with three
gas inlet diameters (0.04, 0.06, and 0.085 in. ID) in a
2-in.-ID, 6-ft-long column are shown in Fig. 19.3, The
dispersion coefficient is seen to be independent of gas
inlet diameter for the size range studied. We have also
made similar measurements in 1%- and 3-in.-diam
columns using inlet diameters ranging from 0.04 to 0.17
in. No effect of gas inlet diameter was found.

It is not surprising that the dispersion coefficient is
independent of gas inlet diameter in the slugging region
(high gas flow rates), since a great deal of bubble

coalescence occurs and the final bubble population may
be essentially independent of the gas inlet diameter.
However, in the bubbly region (low gas flow rates),
little coalescence occurs, and gas inlet diameter would
appear to be more important. It has been postulated’!
that chain bubbling occurs at low gas rates (i.e., that gas
bubbles are not formed consecutively). In this case the
bubble diameter would not be highly dependent on the
gas inlet diameter.

Even with different bubble diameters, one would not
expect large differences in bubble rise velocities, and
possibly the changes in dispersion coefficients would be
small. Davies and Taylor’? report that the bubble rise
velocity is proportional to the Y% power of the bubble
volume. Thus, even for conditions resulting in the
release of single bubbles (i.e., where bubble volume is
proportional to the cube root of the inlet diameter),
one would find little variation in rise velocities with
changes in inlet diameter, and hence little variation in
dispersion coefficient.

Figure 19.4 shows the effect of column diameter on
dispersion coefficient for 1.5-, 2-, and 3-in.-diam
columns. In the slugging region the dispersion coeffi-
cient data from the three columns showed little
difference for a given volumetric gas flow rate. These
data, however, do not extend to high gas rates for all
column diameters; therefore, extrapolation to larger gas
flow rate values is questionable. In the bubbly region,
results from the 2-in. and 3-in.-diam columns are

essentially the same. Results for the 1%-in. column
indicate significantly lower values for the dispersion
coefficient and show a greater dependence on gas flow
rate than has been observed for the larger columns.

The fluorinators of interest will require relatively high
gas rates and will operate in the slugging region. Future
studies will deal mainly with this region but will also
consider other types of gas inlets such as those
envisioned for fluorinators.

19.6 DEMONSTRATION OF THE METAL
TRANSFER PROCESS FOR RARE-EARTH
REMOVAL

E. L. Youngblood L.E. McNeese
W. FE. Schaffer, Jr.  E. L. Nicholson

The first engineering experiment (MTE-1) for the
study of the metal transfer process for removing rare
earths from single-fluid MSBR fuel salt has been
completed. This experiment was performed in a 6-in.-ID
carbon steel vessel (see Fig. 19.5) at 660°C. The vessel
has two compartments that are interconnected at the
bottom by a pool of molten bismuth saturated with
thorium. One compartment contained fluoride salt
(72-16-12 mole % LiF-BeF,-ThF,) to which sufficient
LaF; to produce a concentration of 0.38 mole % and 2
mCi of '*7Nd had been added. The second compart-
ment contained LiCl. A cup containing a lithium-
bismuth solution was also located in the lithium
chloride compartment. During operation LiCl was
circulated through the lithium-bismuth container via a
quartz pump. The concentration of reductant (35 at. %
lithium) in the lithium-bismuth was sufficiently high
that at equilibrium essentially all of the neodymium
and lanthanum should have been extracted-from the
LiCl into the metal phase. The quantities of materials
used in the experiment are given in Table 19.3. The

LiCl was purified prior to use by contact with bismuth
saturated with thorium at 650°C. Both the carbon steel
vessel and the bismuth were hydrogen treated at 650°C
for removal of oxides prior-to use.

The experiment was designed to demonstrate the
selective removal of rare earths (lanthanum and neo-
dymium) from a fluoride salt containing thorium.
Provision was made for determining distribution coef-
ficients between the phases that were present as well as
determining the rate of accumulation of materials in the
lithium-bismuth stripping solution during the experi-
ment.
 

The sequence of operations carried out during the
experiment consisted in pumping the LiCl through the
lithium-bismuth container for 3 hr at a flow rate of 25
cm®/min. Pumping was then stopped, and the system
was allowed to approach equilibrium during a 4-hr
period. At this point, filtered samples of the salt and
metal phases were taken. This sequence was repeated
for 11 cycles. Three additional cycles were run in which
the pumping period was increased to. 7 hr and the
equilibration period was omitted. During the pumping

218

and equilibration periods the bismuth-thorium phase

was forced to flow back and forth between the fluoride
and chloride compartments at a rate equivalent to 10%
of the metal volume every 7 min in order to promote
mixing in the bismuth-thorium phase.

The distribution coefficients for lanthanum and neo-
dymium between the fluoride salt and the thorium-
saturated bismuth were relatively constant throughout
the run; the respective averages, 0.044 and 0.073, were
in good agreement with expected values. On the other
hand, the distribution coefficients for lanthanum and
neodymium between the LiCl and the thorium-
saturated bismuth varied throughout a considerable
range during the run. In general, they were higher than
anticipated during the first part of the run but
approached the expected values near the end of the run,

Approximately 50% of the lanthanum and 25% of the
neodymium (after correcting for '*7Nd decay) origi-

. nally present in the fluoride salt were removed during

the run. Figure 19.6 shows the decreases in the
lanthanum and neodymium concentrations in the
fluoride salt as functions of pumping time and run time.
The rates at which the rare earths were removed are in
close agreement with the expected removal rates.

However, on their removal from the fluoride salt, the
lanthanum and neodymium did not collect in the
lithium-bismuth as expected; in fact, only small frac-
tions of these materials were found there.

After the run was completed the vessel was cut apart
for inspection. Most of the lanthanum and neodymium
that had been removed from the fluoride salt was found
in ‘a Y-in-thick layer of material located at the
interface between the LiCl and the bismuth-thorium.
This material was a black porous solid which contained
metallic particles (probably bismuth). The estimated
weight of the layer was 250 g. Results of a chemical
analysis of the material are given in Table 19.4. X-ray
diffraction data indicated that the material was mostly
ThO, and LiCl and that it possibly contained metallic
lanthanum or LaBi. The thorium oxide was expected to
be present as a result of the presence of water or
oxygen in the system. The layer also contained small
amounts of silicon and iron. -

The chemical form of the rare earths in the black
material has not been ‘determined; however, it is
believed that the presence of oxides in the system may
account for the accumulation of the rare earths at this
point. Oxides were introduced into the system mainly
by two mechanisms. First, general deterioration of the
quartz pump was noted; also, the pump discharge tube,
which was broken off, fell into the lithium-bismuth
solution and was severely attacked. Second, water and
oxygen were introduced into the system at the begin-
ning of the experiment when it became necessary to
replace a faulty pump.

Another metal transfer experiment, in which a metal
pump will be used instead of the quartz pump, is
planned. A metal pump that uses molten bismuth as
check valves has been operated successfully in LiCl at
650°C for about two weeks and appears to be suitable
for this purpose.

19.7 DEVELOPMENT OF A FROZEN-WALL
FLUORINATOR

J. R. Hightower, Jr.  L. E. McNeese

In the fluorination—reductive-extraction—metal-trans-
fer flowsheet for MSBR processing, a continuous
fluorinator is used to remove uranium from the fuel salt

prior to isolation of the protactinium. We are develop-

ing a continuous fluorinator that will be protected from
corrosion by a layer of frozen salt. In a processing plant
the heat necessary for maintaining molten salt adjacent
to the frozen layer will be provided by the decay of
fission products. In order to study fluorinator operation
in a nonradioactive system, it is necessary to provide a
source of heat in the molten salt. Earlier calculations
and experiments' > have indicated that high-frequency
induction heating may be an acceptable method for this
purpose.

We have continued to make calculations that will

- provide an estimate of the performance of a frozen-wall

fluorinator having an induction coil embedded in frozen
salt near the fluorinator wall. Because of uncertainties
in the effect of bubbles in the molten salt and in the
amount of heat that will be generated in the metal walls

of the fluorinator, equipment is being assembled for
studying heat generation in a simulated fluorinator.

Calculated Heat Generation and Heat Transfer Rates.
— Calculations were continued for a fluorinator having
a design designated previously! ? as configuration I. The
following assumptions were made: (1) the fluorinator
consisted of a 5-in.-ID coil (having two turns per inch)
placed inside a 6-in.-diam sched 40 nickel pipe, (2) the
molten salt had the physical properties’ * of 68-20-12
mole % LiF-BeF,-ThF,;, and (3) the induction heater
operated at a frequency of 400 kHz.

Calculated steady-state values of the frozen-salt-layer
thickness are shown in Fig. 19.7 for a range of
induction coil current values and temperature differ-
ences across the frozen layer. It should be noted that
for a given power density in the salt, temperature
differences greater than a critical. value result in
complete freezing of salt in the fluorinator. The
thickness of the frozen layer at the critical temperature
difference has a unique value for all power densities and
is proportional to the inside diameter of the induction
coil. Operating conditions should be chosen such that
(1) a reasonably thick layer of frozen salt is maintained,
(2) a sufficiently large temperature difference for

accurate determination is present, and (3) the thickness
of the frozen layer does not change sharply with
changes in the temperature difference. As shown in Fig.

- 19.7, these conditions can be met with a coil current of
11 A and a temperature difference of 51°C; the
resulting frozen-layer thickness in this case is about 0.3
in.

The existence of a maximum stable steady-state film
thickness suggested that the control of film thickness
might be difficult. In order to determine the conse-
quences of short-term deviations of operating con-
ditions from the prescribed conditions, a transient
analysis of heat generation and heat transfer was carried
out. Conditions that included coil current values of 0
and 11 A with a temperature difference of 82°C, which
is about 20°C greater than the critical temperature
difference for a coil current of 11 A, were examined, As
shown in Fig. 19.8, a period of slightly more than 1.5
hr is required for complete freezing of the salt when
there is no flow of current through the coil, while a
period of more than 2.9 hr is required when a current
of 11 A is flowing through the coil. Thus it is believed

220

that there is sufficient time for corrective control.

action, such as decreasing the temperature difference
across the frozen salt layer, if it should become
necessary. Control of the thickness of the frozen layer
could best be accomplished by using a directly meas-
ured thickness value in a feedback loop; methods for
measuring the thickness of the frozen layer are being
considered.

With the heating method presently under study, heat
will be generated in the external metal wall of the
fluorinator and in thé induction coils as well as in the
molten salt. Estimates of heat generation in these
regions have been made assuming that the fluorinator
and induction coils were fabricated from nickel and
that the metal temperature was maintained below the
Curie transition temperature (358°C). For a 5-in.-ID
coil (two turns per inch) located inside a 6-in.-diam
sched 40 nickel pipe, a coil current of 11 A, and a
frequency of 400 kHz, heat would be generated in the
salt at a rate of 1661 W per foot of fluorinator length,
in the coil at 133 W/ft, and in the vessel wall at 42.7
W/ft. A generator having an output of at least 9.2 kW
would be required for a 5-ft-long fluorinator.

There is considerable uncertainty in the estimated
heat generation rates as well as questions on the effect
of bubbles in the molten salt. Additional information
on these questions will be obtained in a simulated
fluorinator, which will use nitric acid in place of molten
salt.

Simulated Frozen-Wall Fluorinator. — We have de-
signed and are installing an experimental system for
recirculating a 30% HNO; solution through a 5-in.-OD
by S-ftlong glass tube that is surrounded by an
induction coil (coil spacing, two turns per inch) and a
5-ft-long section of pipe representing the fluorinator
vessel. A flow diagram of the system is shown in Fig.
19.9. The acid is circulated through the glass column,
where it is heated by the induction coil, and through a
heat exchanger, where the heat is removed. The heat
generation rate in the acid will be determined from a
heat balance on the acid as it passes through the
column. The pipe representing the fluorinator wall is
equipped with a jacket through which cooling water
passes. The heat generated in the pipe will be calculated
from the change in temperature of the water as it passes
through the jacket. A drain tank is provided for holding
the nitric acid during system maintenance. Air at rates
up to 2 cfm can be countercurrently contacted with the
downflowing acid stream in the column. The induction
generator is a 25-kW Thermionic model 1400 oscillator
which operates at a nominal frequency of 400 kHz.

“success of earlier MSBR processing flowsheets was

dependent on the development of large electrolytic cells
for reducing lithium and thorium from fluoride salt
mixtures at a bismuth cathode. Although the flowsheet
presently under development does not require electro-
lytic cells, cells may be useful in recovering lithium
from salt streams discarded from the metal transfer
process. The cell being considered would use a bismuth
cathode and a graphite anode. Lithium would be
reduced into the bismuth cathode, and chlorine would

be evolved at the anode. Cells of this type would be
much simpler than cells considered earlier. For ex-
ample, they would not require the use of a frozen wall
as a means of protection from corrosion, the anode-
cathode separation could be small in order to limit heat
generation in the salt, and polarization in the salt
adjacent to the cathode would not occur since the salt
phase (LiCl) is a single component.

During the period covered by this report, two
experiments were performed in static cells. The first

 
 

 

 

 

 

was a duplication of an earlier experiment!’ in an
all-metal cell and was designed to determine whether
quartz contributes to the formation of a black material
that had been noted in all previous electrolysis experi-
ments. The second experiment was made to study the
electrolytic reduction of lithium from LiCl into a
bismuth cathode. Results from these experiments are
summarized below.

. All-Metal Electrolytic Cell Experiment. — In this
experiment the cell vessel consisted of an 18-in. section
of 6-in. sched 40 mild steel pipe. The anode was a 15-kg
pool of bismuth; the cathode was a %;-in.-diam mild
steel rod located at the center of the vessel and placed
!, to 1 in. above the bismuth pool. Observations in the
salt phase were made using the bismuth surface as a
mirror to reflect light to a sight glass in the top flange
of the vessel. The electrolyte, a mixture of LiF-BeF,
(66-34 mole %), filled the vessel to a level about 3 in.
above the bismuth surface. The bismuth had been
sparged with H, at 600°C to reduce oxides.

The cell was operated at a voltage of 2.3 V (16.8 A)
with the cathode rod positioned %; in. above the
bismuth for about 1 min. The cathode was then raised
to 1 in. above the surface of the bismuth, and the
current decreased to 15.6 A, where it remained con-
stant for about 2 min. The voltage was increased to 2.5
V, resulting in a current that increased from 19.0 to
21.8 A over a period of 7.5 min; the cathode current
density was about 2.0 A/cm?. The total current
transferred during the run was 12,400 C. The cell

222

temperature was 550°C. During the passage of electric

current, there was no evidence of the dark material
observed in the salt previously; density gradient pat-
terns were visible and showed convective mixing in the
salt phase. After operation the salt appeared to have a
more definite green color and showed signs of a slight
turbidity, although it was still quite transparent.

Part of the material that deposited on the iron
cathode appeared to be metallic and was probably not
as dense as the salt, since it formed near the salt-gas
interface and tended to spread over the salt surface. The
remaining material was black, nonmetallic in appear-
ance, and formed more uniformly over the submerged
part of the steel electrode. The deposited material (16.5
g) had the composition 9.0 wt % Be, 17.0 wt % Li, 71.8
wt % F, with traces of iron and bismuth. The formation
of such a deposit is explained as follows. As BeF, was
reduced at the cathode during cell operation, the

155, R. Hightower, Jr1., M. S. Lin, and L. E, McNeese, MSR
Program Semiann. Progr. Rept, Feb. 28, 1970, ORNL-4548, p.
314,

concentration of BeF, in the salt in the vicinity of the
cathode decreased. At the operating temperature of
550°C, LiF began to crystallize when the BeF, con-
centration reached 30 mole %. Further reduction of
BeF, was accompanied by the precipitation of solid
LiF in the vicinity of the cathode. When the cathode
was removed from the cell, both LiF and BeF, were
carried with the reduced beryllium,

If one assumes that the lithium was present as LiF
and that the remaining fluorine was associated with
beryllium as BeF, , the cathode deposit contained about
0.5 g of beryllium metal (33% of the beryllium present
in the deposit) or 0.11 g-equiv of beryllium. Since
0.129 electrical equivalent was passed, this represents a
current efficiency of about 85% for beryllium reduc-
tion. The current efficiency was probably actually
closer to 100%; however, the additional beryllium was
not recovered with the cathode deposit but floated
away from the cathode on the salt surface. Some
particulate material was noted on the salt surface when
the cell was dismantled.

The results of this test indicate that quartz may have
contributed to the formation of black material in the
salt, since the salt in this case remained transparent.
However, the lack of a bismuth cathode into which
lithium could have been reduced may have resulted in a
system that was too different from previous cells to
permit conclusions to be drawn. The results of the
second experiment (described below) suggest that the
presence of a bismuth cathode into which lithium is
reduced may contribute to the formation of black
material.

Reduction of LiCl at a Bismuth Cathode. — An
experiment in which LiCl was reduced in a cell having a
bismuth cathode and a graphite anode was carried out
in order to determine the maximum achievable anode
current density, the current efficiency, the extent of
attack on the graphite anode, and operational diffi-
culties associated with forming lithium-bismuth alloy at
the cathode.

The electrolytic cell consisted of a 4-in.-diam quartz
cell vessel, a 3%-in.-diam by 3% -in.-tall molybdenum
cup containing the bismuth cathode, and a 1-in.-diam
graphite anode. Provision was made for measuring the
volume of chlorine produced at the anode by allowing
the chlorine to displace argon from a 25-ft section of
% in. copper tubing. The volume of displaced argon
was measured with a wet-test meter.

Approximately 4.9 kg of bismuth and 1.0 kg of LiCl
were transferred to the cell after purification. The
bismuth was purified by hydrogen sparging at 650°C
until the water concentration in the off-gas was less

a

°4)
 

 

*)

than 1 ppm. The LiCl was purified by contact with
thorium-saturated bismuth for about 100 hr at 650°C.
During their transfer to the cell, both the salt and
bismuth were filtered through molybdenum filters
having a mean pore size of 30 to 40 pu.

The cell was operated at 670°C at the following
anode current densities (based on the area of the
bottom of the anode, 5.06 cm?) for the indicated
periods of time: 4.37 A/cm? for 7 min, 6.7 A/cm? for
6 min, and 8.6 A/cm® for 6 min. There appeared to be
no limiting current density in this operating range.
Disengagement of the chlorine gas that was produced at
the anode proceeded smoothly and without difficulty.
(The anode had been slightly rounded to promote
disengagement of gas.) With the initiation of current
flow, the salt turned red; the color grew darker as
operation continued, until finally the salt was opaque.
Measurement of the Cl, evolution rate (and hence
current efficiency) was not possible because of reaction
of the Cl, with the iron components in the cell vessel.

The cell was then cooled to room temperature for
examination. A thin metallic film present on the salt
surface at the end of the experiment was removed
intact when the anode was raised at the end of the
experiment. A large amount of black material was
found to be suspended in the LiCl. The material was
mainly iron but had a bismuth content of 0.63 wt %.
The molybdenum cup appeared to be unattacked.

The material that caused the salt to turn red during
the operation of this cell is believed to be Li; Bi, which
dissolved in the salt. It is reported that Li; Bi is slightly
soluble in LiCI-LiF eutectic which is in contact with
solid Liz Bi or with a bismuth solution saturated with

223

Li3Bi.'® At the current densities used in this experi-
ment, the cathode was probably polarized; this would
have resulted in the formation of solid Liz Bi at the
salt-bismuth interface. Polarization of the cathode
could be avoided by agitating the cathode and re-
stricting the cathode current density. Thus it should be
possible to avoid saturating the bismuth surface with
Liz Bi, which would significantly reduce the concentra-
tion of the lithium-bismuth intermetallic compound in
the salt.!”

Although this experiment pointed out an unexpected
difficulty, it confirms our expectation that the reduc-
tion of LiCl using a bismuth cathode and graphite
anode should proceed readily.

Effect of Dissolved Li;Bi in Previous Electrolytic
Cells, — The knowledge that Li;Bi (which may be
formed at a polarized cathode) is slightly soluble in
molten salts offers an explanation for the formation of
black material in previous electrolysis experiments in
which bismuth electrodes and LiF-BeF, electrolyte
were used. In these experiments Li; Bi could have been
introduced into the salt at the cathode surface and
could have reacted with BiF; (formed at the anode) to
produce LiF and finely divided bismuth. The latter
product would cause the salt to become opaque and
would explain why no black material was seen in the
all-metal cell experiment previously reported (i.e., there
was no reductant in the salt).

20. Continuous Salt Purification System

R. B. Lindauer

The system was charged with 28 kg of LiF-
BeF, (66-34 mole -%), and ten flooding runs were
carried out using hydrogen and argon. After the first
flooding run with hydrogen had been completed, the
feed line to the column became plugged. Since oxide in
the salt was believed to be causing the restriction, the
salt was treated with H,-HF. Oxide exceeding the
amount that was soluble in the salt was removed, as
indicated by analysis of the off-gas stream for water;
however, the plugging recurred after salt was again fed
through - the column. The difficulty was apparently
caused by plugging of the Y ¢-in. holes in the bottom of
the inlet salt distribution ring, since no restriction was
found in the %-in.-OD feed line. A ¥%4-in.-diam hole
was drilled through the inner wall of the distributor ring
to provide an alternate salt inlet, and the feed line was
replaced with a %-in.-diam line. After this modifi-
cation, satisfactory salt flow to the column was
obtained.

During the flooding runs, salt flow rates of 50 to 400
cm®/min were used with argon and hydrogen flow rates
of up to 7.5 and 30 liters/min respectively; the
temperature was 700°C in each case. The pressure drop
across the column increased linearly with increases in
gas flow rate, as shown in Fig. 20.1, which summarizes
the best data from the ten runs. At the flow rates
studied thus far, the salt flow rate had only a minor
effect on pressure drop. In the one run in which the
system was operated with a very high salt flow rate
(400 cm®/min) and a very low argon flow rate, the
pressure drop was about 30 in. H, O. This indicates that
a column of this type should have a much higher
capacity for an operation such as oxide removal from
salt by treatment with H, -HF, where the HF utilization
is high and low gas-to-salt flow ratios can be used. At
the higher gas flow rates used in the present studies, the
combined pressure drop in the off-gas line and in the
column is sufficient to depress the salt-gas interface
below the seal loop in the salt exit line from the
column. The maximum flow rates possible with the

224

L. E. McNeese

present system are about 19% of the calculated flooding
rate. At these flow rates, operation was not smooth,
and the column pressure drop fluctuated over a range of
2 to 3 in. of salt. The variation in pressure drop was
possibly the result of poor salt distribution at the top of
the column.

In the final flooding run, stable operation was
obtained with a salt flow rate of 100 c¢m®/min and
hydrogen flow rates up to 20 liters/min. This hydrogen
flow rate is sufficient to reduce 400 ppm of iron (as
Fe?*) from a 100-cm®/min salt stream, assuming that
the salt and gas reach equilibrium at 700°C; however,
the mass transfer coefficient is probably not sufficiently
high to reach equilibrium with the present column
height (81 in.).
