| - SECTION III. REACTORS FUELED WITH MOLTEN-SALT SOLUTIONS

Chapter 1. Introduction

 

The reactor concepts described in this section utilize a fluid fuel
consisting of a fissionable material dissolved in a carrier of molten salt.
Some such concepts also call for a molten salt as a primary coolant.

H. G. MacPherson has reviewed the technology of molten-salt
reactors.ls?

The fissionable compound usually chosen is uranium tetrafluoride.?
. Uranium fluorides other than the tetrafluoride have the disadvantages of
: higher volatility, instability, or corrosivity. Chlorides or fluorides as
{ = solvents have been given the most consideration because of the need for
3 radiation stability and high solubility. The chlorides are used for fast
; reactors, and the fluorides, because of their low cross sections for ther-
mal neutrons, are best for thermal and epithermal reactors.

Compounds other than fluorides and chlorides have been suggested,
including phosphates,’ sulfates,* sulfides,* hydrosulfides,* and hydroxides.>6
Molten fluoride mixtures, e.g. LiF-NaF, have the most desirable proper-
ties: they dissolve adequate amounts of fuel; they have satisfactory heat
transfer properties; they resist radiation; they can tolerate an accumu-
lation of fission products; the melting points are low enough that corrosion
problems of excessively high temperatures are avoided; and the vapor
pressures are low enough to permit low-pressure operation.® 7:8 Although
fluorine itself has some moderating properties, a better moderator must
be present, either in the molten-salt mixture or as a separate structure,
to obtain a thermal reactor of reasonable size. The alkali metal fluo-
rides have been especially considered as solvents because they have low
melting points. Beryllium fluoride may be added to the mixture as a
moderator, and thorium tetrafluoride can be added for conversion.

Graphite and beryllium are commonly used as structured moder-
ators. Discussion of structured-moderated reactors in this section may
appear anomalous, in that most reactors in this first part of the catalog
have completely homogeneous cores. The fuel itself, however, is a homo-
geneous solution, and such structure-moderated reactors are otherwise
closely related to the more homogeneous ones.

Molten-salt reactors can be classified in several ways--by the
purpose of the reactor, by the use or nonuse of a separate moderator,
by the cooling method (internal or external), or by the core arrangement

 
 

(one- or two-region). For this catalog, the classification will be by one-
and two-region reactors. Chapter 2 will cover the first and Chapter 3

the second. According to MacPherson,’ the most attractive types are the
one-region, graphite-moderated reactor; and the two-region reactor. The
one-region reactor is simpler, and it is cheaper to construct and operate »
for small power stations. Most of the one-region reactors discussed in

Chapter 2 are burners. The two-region reactor has better neutron econ--

omy, is better for breeding, and, in larger installations, gives higher con-

version ratio and lower fuel-cycle costs.

ix

The origin of the molten-salt concept is not clear. Early in the
1950's, however, molten salts were considered as reactor fuels to satisfy
the need for high temperature and extremely high power densities needed
for reactors intended for nuclear aircraft propulsion. Development work,
- particularly at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, resulted in several con-
cepts, and in 1954 the Aircraft Reactor Experiment (ARE), part of the
‘Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project (ANP), was operated. Since the
cancellation, as of October 1957, of work on circulating-fuel reactors
for aircraft,’ work has continued aimed at developing power and breeder
reactors that utilize molten salts. -

Molten-salt reactors are attractive concepts for several rea-
sons.h2:7 They provide high temperatures in a low-pressure system
to produce steam at temperatures high enough to give high thermal-
cycle efficiencies. They are versatile because of the range of solubili-
ties of different compounds of fissionable elements in salts. The simple
ionic salts are stable under irradiation. Such reactors also have the
advantages of other fluid-fueled reactors; for example, they have high nega-
tive temperature coefficients of reactivity, fission products can be re-
moved continuously, fuel elements need not be fabricated, and make-up
fuel may be added as needed. According to Weinberg, a great advantage
is that the fissionable materials can be consumed at very high thermal
efficiencies and with extremely high burnup. The major problem with a
salt-fueled reactor is that all the salt in the system must be kept molten
at all times.

In 1959, the Fluid Fuel Reactor Task Force compared the aqueous
homogeneous, molten-salt, and liquid-metal fueled reactors.! The prin-
cipal conclusions were: the molten-salt reactor had the best chance of
achieving technical feasibility; only with the homogeneous aqueous reactor
was there a possibility of achieving a reasonably short doubling time;
and the total power costs for the MSR were between those for the aqueous
reactor and the liquid-metal-fueled reactor.

x

Salt-fueled reactors are advanced concepts, and there is as yet no
adequate experience for building large-scale power plants, although many r
concepts have been developed for such plants.” Current development is
represented by the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment, which achieved cri-
ticality at ORNL in mid 1965.

Chapter 2. One-region Reactors

Most of the one-region reactors discussed in this chapter are
burners, with highly enriched uranium in the molten fuel and no external
blanket. The converters have either partially enriched uranium or tho-
rium salts as fertile material in the fuel-salt mixture. One-region re-
actors have been considered both for aircraft propulsion and for the
generation of heat and electrical power. The ANP (Aircraft Nuclear
Propulsion) Project led to many concepts, and one reactor experiment,
ARE (Aircraft Reactor Experiment), was operated for a short time. As
part of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project, several designs for
molten-salt-fueled aircraft reactors were proposed both before and
after the operation of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment. In addition to
the studies at ORNL, work was carried out by such contractors as the
H. K. Ferguson Company and the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Company.

In 1957, however, work on circulating-fuel reactors for aircraft was
discontinued. The MSRE (Molten Salt Reactor Experiment) is the cur-
rent major effort on this type of reactor, with criticality achieved in
mid 1965.

Reactors for Propulsion
Early Concepts

Concepts reported by H. K. Ferguson in 1950 and 1951 included
both reactors fueled with molten fluorides and a few fueled with suspen-
sions of uranium oxide in molten sodium hydroxide. The suspensions
were used because of the difficulty of dissolving uranium compounds in
NaOH. These suspensions are included here, although they cannot be
defined as molten-salt solutions.

In the Homogeneous Circulating Suspension Reactor, the fuel is
a suspension of 2.2 wt. % uranium oxide in sodium hydroxide, which acts
as moderator.! The fuel enters the top of the reactor, where a whirl-
ing motion is imparted to it by vanes, and leaves through the bottom ta
a heat exchanger.

In a similar concept,! the fuel is a coarse suspension of the oxide
in sodium hydroxide, which circulates through a spherical reactor. The
oxide is removed in a cyclone separator; the liquid passes through a
heat exchanger, and then picks up the oxide before returning to the core.

The Circulating-fluoride. Reactor concept includes beryllium
rods as moderator and a molten fluoride fuel, which circulates to a
wraparound heat exchanger.” This concept was studied as a variation
of a reactor fueled with molten metal.

circulating fuel, and to study the kinetic behavior of the reactor.

In another concept,! the beryllium moderator is in different forms.
In one, it is distributed throughout the core; in the other, it is a reflec-
tor layer.

The Circulating Moderator- coolant Reactor utilized uranium
tetrafluoride dissolved in a molten mixture of sodium and beryllium
fluorides.® Instead of a solid moderator, molten sodium hydroxide is
used as moderator, coolant, and reflector. The sodium hydroxide flows

downward through tubes in the core to cool the quiescent fuel salt. Sec-

ondary cooling is by exchange with sodium in a heat exchanger. The re-
flector is a jacket of the hydroxide around the core. The design power
for this reactor is 140 MW(t). A very similar reactor is the Circulating-
moderator ARE.>

In 1952, Dayton and Chastain made calculations for the design of
one- and two-region circulating reactors using hydroxides as moderator-

_coolants.* The compounds studied were sodium hydroxide, lithium-7

hydroxide, and lithium-7 deuteroxide. Uranium-233 oxide, suspended in
the hydroxide within the spherical reactor, was the fuel specified. For
the one-region reactors, thorium oxide was added to the fuel for breed-
ing. The conversion ratios were so low that the authors concluded that
internal breeding would not be feasible if a small critical mass were
required. If, however, cost and size are not considered, Li’OD appears
to be the most attractive of the compounds.

Two ORNL designs were for a 200-MW(t) Aircraft Reactor (1951)°
and a Circulating-fuel Reactor for Direct Heat Transfer to Engines
(1953).8

In the first reactor, the fuel--a molten mixture of beryllium,
sodium, and uranium fluorides--does not circulate. It is contained in
U-tubes, which are within coolant tubes through which sodium circulates.
Beryllium oxide is the moderator and reflector in the cylindrical reactor.
This was intended to be a full-scale reactor, and the ARE was to dupli-
cate it as far as possible in materials, temperature pattern, and kinetics,
but not in fuel circulation or power. In the second reactor, hot fuel cir-
culates from the core directly to the aircraft engine; otherwise this re-
actor is similar in many respects to the first.

The Aircraft Reactor Experiment

 

The ARE was built at Oak Ridge National Laboratory as a
circulating-fuel reactor of low power and high temperature, but materi-
als suitable for use in a reactor of high power were employed.”? Ac-
cording to Weinberg, "The purpose of this reactor experiment was simply
to gain experience in handling salts in a reactor at very high tempera-

tures, to see whether one could in fact contain the intensely radioactive
n10

Before the circulating fuel was decided upon, solid fuel pins and
stagnant fluoride fuels were considered.!!

Stagnant fluoride fuel was used in the first design.!! The core
would have a cylindrical moderator matrix, containing vertical holes
into which small fuel tubes would be placed. This assembly would be

‘within a cylindrical pressure shell, through which sodium would be pas-

sed. A slab of boron carbide would be placed at the top of the lattice,
and the fuel tubes would extend through the slab, which would act as a
"neutron curtain" for control. Severe problems, however, made this
concept less attractive than a circulating-fuel reactor. The molten salts
have poor thermal conductivity. The extremely large thermal gradiant
at reasonably high power levels would make the temperature of the fuel
near the center of the tube prohibitively high. There would be difficul-
ties in loading the reactor. Also, during loading, large control rods
would be needed, and the heat cycling and draining of coolant between
fuel additions would pose many problems. Expansion during melting
might be a problem relative to possible deformation (expansion) or
rupture.

The final fuel was uranium tetrafluoride dissolved in a mixture
of sodium and zirconium fluorides. Beryllium oxide was the moderator
and reflector; blocks of it were stacked around the fuel tubes, tubes for
reflector cooling, and control assemblies that passed vertically through
the core. The fuel took a serpentine path through parallel circuits to
the outside of the core, finally leaving at the bottom. It circulated to an
external heat exchanger then back to the core. Sodium passing through
tubes in the moderator cooled it. Barren fuel salt also had been sug-
gested as coolant. The maximum design power was 2.5 MW(t).'?* The
reactor became critical on November 11, 1954, and it was shut down
the following evening. It had demonstrated the feasibility of using a
high-temperature fluoride fuel in a circulating-fuel reactor.

A reactor with a tandem heat exchanger was suggested as a
modification of the ARE.!® The moderator-reflector is water or sodium
hydroxide, with the core and the tandem heat exchanger being surrounded
by a layer of water at 300-350 psi. The fuel enters the reactor at the
top, makes a loop through fuel tubes in the reactor, and exits to heat ex-
changers. The moderator enters the lattice around the periphery at the
rear of the reactor and flows to an outlet at the forward end.

In another modification, the fuel-coolant salt circulated through
the coolant tubes in the BeO reflector of the ARE.!® In this modification,
there would be a larger leakage of high-energy neutrons and of gamma
radiation than with barren fuel salt as moderator coolant.

The Fireball and Related Concepts

 

A concept that originated before the operation of the ARE and was
scheduled for use in later developments was a circulating-fuel, reflector-
moderated reactor, known originally as the Fireball.!™!® In this reactor :

‘there are no fuel tubes. The fuel circulates in an annulus between a cen-

tral island of beryllium moderator and an outer shell of moderator and
reflector. In the earliest design the central island was spherical, but
later development resulted in a vase-shaped island.!® This shape, ac-

.cording to Fraas, reduces the critical mass, improves power distribu-

tion, and hydrodynamically gives the best passage for fuel.’® Cooling is
by circulating the fluid salt to a circumferential wraparound heat exchanger
between the moderator shell and the pressure shell. There heat transfer
to sodium or sodium-potassium takes place. The fuel passes downward

in the annulus, then outward. The moderator is cooled by sodium flowing
downward between the beryllium and the enclosing shell.

Fraas and Savolainen have discussed eight core designs for the
spherical reflector-moderated reactor, with a wraparound heat exchanger,
that are related to the Fireball.’ :

The simplest design is the core in which a thick spherical mod-
erator shell surrounds a spherical chamber for liquid fuel. The shell
has top and bottom ducts for fuel to pass in and out of the core. Because
of absorption of neutrons near the fuel-reflector interface, power density
decreases to a comparatively low value near the center. Also, the flow
pattern is indeterminate. Vanes or screens at the inlet might improve
the flow.

Adding a central island reduces critical mass and gives a more
uniform power distribution. The moderator, however, must be cooled in
this design. Liquid bismuth or lead could be circulated between the fuel
and moderator regions to remove the heat.

Graphite was suggested in two other modifications. A block of
graphite containing parallel passages for fuel flow is placed in the central
zone to give a nearly homogeneous mixture of fuel and graphite in the
core. Concentric shells of graphite could be used as moderator and as
guides for the fuel flow. The authors concluded that these designs were
little better, from the nuclear standpoint, than the simple core with no
moderator structure.

Three designs were for the use of molten sodium hydroxide as a
liquid moderator. In one, the moderator passes through coiled tubes in
the core. The tubes would both serve as moderator in the core and im-
prove distribution of fuel velocity. It would, however, be difficult to : “
avoid local hot spots, and the structural material would capture a high

percentage of neutrons, so that the critical mass would be increased. In
two other modifications, fuel passes through tubes and the hydroxide mod-
erator circulates through spaces between fuel passages. In one design,
the tubes are straight. In the other, they are curved to fit the shell con-
tours, in order to reduce the volume of header regions and to give a more
nearly spherical core shape, with lower shield weight.

Some concepts that have employed the Fireball design with little
change are the Aircraft Reactor Test,?® The Circulating Fluoride- fuel
High Flux Reactor,?! and a modified Fireball concept of General Electric.
In the High-flux Reactor, which includes a central island of graphite, use
of a layer of bismuth between the central island and the fuel layer was
suggested by the author to resist flow of thermal neutrons from the central
island, where they are created, to the shell, where they are absorbed. It
would also protect the internal island from gamma radiation.

22

Pratt & Whitney concepts were originally variations and develop-
ments of the Fireball design, with changes in the dimensions and other
factors to give reactors of different power levels, 23:24 In two simplified
versions?® the annulus of the Fireball is replaced by five tubes in the
center of the core. In one, the core is a graphite cylinder and in the
other it is a beryllium sphere. The design was intended to give more
structural stability and to alleviate problems of flow separation. Graph-
ite-was used to obtain more favorable critical mass dnd power distribu-
tion. The beryllium-moderated concept was developed into a more complete
design.?® In another modification, the island is cylindrical, rather than
vase shaped as in the original Fireball.?” Other variations considered
briefly were the use of beryllium, beryllium oxide, or graphite for the
island and for the reflector, and using and not using a reflector. Alterna-
tive fuels considered were lithium or beryllium fluorides as bases for
fuels, and slurries of uranium dioxides in alkali metals.?* Lithium-7 was
considered as a coolant,?® and zirconium hydride as a moderator.

The use of zirconium hydride as a moderator was incorporated in
one concept.’® The core consists of fuel tubes and zirconium hydride
rods, with lithium-7 flowing parallel to the tubes. Two arrangements of
fuel tubes were studied. In one, a multitube arrangement; the fuel flows
down through the inner tubes then returns through the outer tubes. In the
other, a thimble-tube design, the fuel flows through an inner tube and re-
turns through the annulus between this tube and an enclosing outer tube.
Lithium-7 could circulate directly to the engine radiator. The hydride
moderator, which would be clad with molybdenum, is claimed to permit
high température without the need for excessive cooling or structural
support.

In 1955, staff members at the Walter Kidde Nuclear Laboratories,
Inc., published designs for reactors for aircraft propulsion.’
 

16

One reactor was similar to an earlier concept of H. K. Ferguson
Co. The fuel is stationary, within tubes. A great many tubes are re-

‘quired because they must be small to avoid excessive internal tempera-

tures. Heat removal would be difficult because of the poor conductivity
of the molten salts.

Three were circulating -molten-salt reactors, two closely re-
sembling earlier concepts. They included a reactor having the Fireball
structure, with a modification in which the core is cylindrical rather
than spherical; a circulating-fluoride reactor with rods of beryllium
moderator in the core; and a circulating-fluoride reactor with molten
sodium hydroxide as moderator and reflector.

An ORSORT concept, the Screwball (1953), differed from the Fire-
ball chiefly in that helical fuel tubes replaced the annular passage be-
tween the central island, which was eliminated, and the moderator shell.*®
Thus it somewhat resembles the Pratt & Whitney concept described in
Ref. 26. The moderator is circulating NaOD. According to the authors,
problems with the Fireball design indicated need for changes. The Screw
ball design is claimed to eliminate or alleviate all but one, namely,
pressure surges. Usé of fuel tubes reduces uncertainty of sustained in-
stabilities in fuel region. "Self-shielding" should be less with the tubes
than with the spherical fuel annulus of the Fireball. Lower power den-
sity (2.5 KW/ cm?) was chosen to aid problems of questionable fuel density.
Removal of the solid island eliminates the need to cool it. The pressure-
surge problem was not alleviated. Surges may be larger with Screwball
because of the tortuous expansion path out of the core, but pressure is
not expected to be great enough to cause difficulty. Substitution of circu-
lating NaOD leads to problems with corrosion; stagnant or low-velocity
layers of NaOD next to hot fuel tubes or containing shell, therefore, must
not occur.

Reactor for Ship Propulsion

 

ORSORT students designed a molten-salt reactor for ship propul-
sion, which contained many of the features of the aircraft reactor con-
cepts.’ A compact, high-performance reactor was sought in order to
reduce weight. In the cylindrical reactor core, the moderator is an
array of Inconel-clad beryllium oxide rods tipped with poison material
to reduce end leakage and fissioning in the entrance and exit plenums for
the fuel. The fuel flows up through the central core region, then down
through an annular downcomer at the core periphery. There it enters a
wraparound heat exchanger, which is cooled by molten salt. This
125-MW(t) reactor has a nickel reflector, as well as extensive shielding.

An advanced design of this type of reactor was conceived by the
same group to improve reactor performance and reduce weight. To im-
prove moderation in the core, the designers substituted zirconium hydride

 

 
il

 

 

 

 

 

17

for beryllium oxide as moderator and used a beryllium-containing fuel.
Nickel-molybdenum cladding was substituted for Inconel cladding in the
core because thinner cladding could be used to reduce the amount of
poison in the core. In the resulting design, dimensions and power level
were reduced.

Reactors for Electrical Power and Heat

Even before the Aircraft Reactor Experiment was carried out,
some one-region reactors had been proposed for purposes other than
aircraft propulsion. Development of such reactors has continued. They
include some designs that generally resemble the ARE in core structure.

Early Concepts

An early concept, on which little has been published, is for a
thorium converter for electrical power production, which was developed
by Davidson and Robb.?* In this converter, the fuel is a solution of
93 percent enriched U?**F, in molten fluorides containing thorium fluo-
ride for conversion.

Four concepts, by students at the Oak Ridge School of Reactor
Technology, are intended for power and heat, and one is a breeder.

The Fused Salt Reactor for Power and Heat, proposed in 1953,
could be either a burner or converter, with thorium fluoride added to
the molten salt if conversion is desired.>® The core is a graphite
sphere, through which fuel circulates from the bottom through chan-
nels cut into the graphite. The graphite is clad with an Inconel shell
and is contained in an Inconel pressure vessel. The reactor is designed
for installation at remote locations to produce power--about 5 MW(t)--
and heat. The heat is produced by water heated by low-pressure waste
gas from the turbine.

In the Fused Salt Breeder Reactor (FSBR),** the fuel is a solu-
tion of uranium-233 fluoride and thorium fluoride in fused lithium-7
fluoride and beryllium fluoride. Stacked graphite blocks form the core,
which has a spherical top, a flat bottom, and cylindrical sides. The fuel
passes through passages in the graphite and through heat exchangers
in the graphite surrounding the core. The fuel passes to intermediate

heat exchangers cooled by sodium. Two sizes were considered, one for
125 MW{e) and one for 250 MW({e). Co

The 600-MW Fused Salt Homogeneous Reactor Power Plant®®
utilizes a fuel salt of fluorides of uranium-235, zirconium, and sodium.
The reactor is stated to be self-moderating because of the fluorine.

 
 

18

The reactor vessel is a vertical cylinder, with a dished bottom, of stain-
less steel. The fuel circulates through the multipass vessel upward to

a sodium loop within the vessel, to an annular U-tube heat exchanger,
and to a secondary heat exchanger. The design of this burner could be
altered so as to breed uranium-235,

" The Fused Salt Reactor for Process Heat (1956)3%6 has two features
that differ somewhat from previous designs. The aim was to generate as
much heat as possible in the regions of the reactor not bearing fuel and
to use a ceramic as both moderator and heat-exchange medium for high-
temperature heat exchangers. Magnesium oxide was chosen as the best
available material to meet both requirements, even though it is not a
very good moderator. The reactor consists of a cylindrical matrix of
hexagonal magnesium oxide blocks penetrated by Inconel tubes in a tri-
angular array. Fuel circulates through these tubes. Beryllium oxide

‘reflector surrounds the core, and a steel pressure vessel is the con-

tainer. Of the 400 MW(t) produced by the reactor, 35 Mw is generated
in the MgO moderator and is used to heat steam from heat exchangers.
The moderator is perforated to allow passage of steam. The remaining
heat is removed by the fuel circulating to external heat exchangers. The
design is for four reactors to be used in conjunction with a coal-
hydrogenation plant. The high-temperature steam from the moderator
would be used to gasify coal to produce hydrogen for the hydrogenation.
The remaining steam, at a lower temperature, would be used to drive
turbines.

The use of natural convection has been suggested to eliminate the
problem of providing reliable, long-lived pumps for fuel circulation.3?:38
This advantage is at the cost of a greater fuel volume. The fuel circu-
lates by natural convection through the core, vertical convection risers,
and primary heat exchangers. In the design suggested, the core is spher-
ical, with the primary heat exchanger above the core. The heat-exchange
medium may be either molten salt or helium. Either would give a power
of 22 MW(e). This system may be attractive for some applications because
of easy maintenance and good reliability.

Molten lead is suggested as coolant in an ORNL concept of 1958.%
The only moderator is the fluorine in the fuel salt--NaF-ZrF,-UF,. The
molten lead circulates the fuel salt by direct mixing with a jet pump.
Heat exchange is rapid and no primary exchanger is needed. The lead
is separated from the salt downstream by a pipeline separator; the fuel
goes to the core, the lead to a heat exchanger. The design power is
194 MW (e). |

The MSRE and Related Concepts

Before the design of the MSRE was decided upon, other concepts
originated from the Molten Salt Reactor Project at Oak Ridge National

Laboratory. Two that were developed furthest were the Slightly Enriched,
Fused-Salt-Fueled Reactor and the Experimental Molten-Salt-Fueled
30 MW(t) Power Reactor.

Predecessors to MSRE

 

The Slightly Enriched, Fused-Salt-Fueled Reactor? * is a conver-
ter fueled with slightly enriched uranium tetrafluoride dissolved in molten
lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride. It was proposed in 1958, and a
preliminary design was published in 1959. The cylindrical core is of un-
clad graphite, which serves as moderator. The fuel flows upward through
holes in the graphite. Highly enriched uranium is added as makeup fuel.
The reactor produces 315 MW(e).

The Experimental Molten-Salt-Fueled 30-MW(t) Power Reactor##:43
is a burner fueled with highly enriched uranium tetrafluoride dissolved in
molten lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride. There is no other mod-
erator. The core is a sphere of INOR-8. The fuel circulates to a heat
exchanger. Barren molten salt--lithium fluoride-beryllium fluoride--is
the secondary coolant.

MSRE

The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment**-4 is the first of the three
stages in the development of molten-salt reactors discussed by MacPherson
in 1960.*7 After this one-region reactor, a two-region reactor experiment
was planned, and a high-power prototype of a molten-salt reactor would
follow.

The MSRE has the objectives of showing that a circulating molten-
salt-fuel system will operate successfully and demonstrating a reactor
type that can be developed into an advanced converter or thermal breeder.
It also is intended to demonstrate that unclad graphite is a satisfactory
moderator that can be used in contact with molten salts for extended
periods and that on-site hydrofluorination processing can clean up con-
taminated fuel.

The MSRE is a converter, with the possibility of internal breeding.
In structure it resembles the Aircraft Reactor Experiment more closely
than such later aircraft reactor developments as the Fireball. The mod-
erator consists of vertical stringers of graphite, which form a cylindrical
core within a reactor vessel. The fuel passes downward in an annulus
between the graphite cylinder and the containing vessel. It then flows
upward in channels formed between the stringers, out the top to a heat
exchanger (in which the intermediate coolant is LiF-BeF,;), and back to
the core.

Advanced Concept

The use of molten fluorides as fuel in a 10-MW(e) fast reactor
for spacecraft was considered by Allen.*® Calculations were made to
estimate the size and weight of such a reactor and to compare them with
those of a reactor fueled with uranium carbide. Highly enriched (93.5
percent) uranium tetrafluoride was the fuel, with fluorides of sodium,
beryllium, lithium, and zirconium considered as solvents. The fuel
mixture for which calculations were made is 70 percent UF,, 30 percent
NaF. Lithium is the coolant, and the reactor is unmoderated, with an
inner reflector of zirconium and an outer reflector of beryllium. The
author concluded that uranium fluoride does not have an apparent ad-
vantage over uranium carbide; it does not achieve the full potential of
liquid fuels for the purpose; and other liquid fuels, such as liquid met-
als, should be studied.

Status

The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment apparently is the only cur-
rent active program for developing molten-salt reactors. Construction
is in progress, and criticality was achieved in 1965.* The one-region
reactor is meant as an intermediate step in developing a large two-
region breeder, but one-region reactors have also been suggested for
uses in their own right, especially in smaller power stations.*’

Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division, United Aircraft Corp.

References: Unpublished reports, 1954.
Originators: Staff members.
Status: Design calculations, 1954; project discontinued, 1957.
Details: Same as Fireball, except that fuel annulus is replaced by five tubes
with end diffusers, in a circular pattern, which pass through the core. In
one, the tubes pass through a graphite cylinder within a Be core. Graphite
is believed to give better critical mass and power distribution. In the other
design, the fuel passages are through the spherical Be core, which is within
an Inconel pressure vessel. This modification of the fuel passage is believed
to reduce flow-separation problems and to give more structural stability.

Status: Design, 1956; project discontinued, 1957.
Details: Intermediate neutrons, steady state, burner. Fuel-coolant:
enriched UF, in molten NaF-ZrF4.. Moderator: Be. Fuel circulates to
wraparound NaK heat exchanger between reflector and pressure shell.
Reflector: Be. Core: essentially cylinder of Be (29.1 in. diameter, 37 in.
high) through which 30 straight parallel tubes (3 in. ID) pass. Fuel enters
core from plenum chamber above, passes downward through fuel tubes,
enters plenum at bottom, and flows on shell side of heat exchanger. Fuel
enters core at 1200°F; leaves at 1600°F. Core and reflector cooled by Na
flow. Internal shield: cermet of B;°C and Cu, clad with Inconel, between
reflector shell and reflector support shell. Control: central vertical rod,
in thimble, for reactor shim and control--rod is clad cermet of B;°C and
Cu cooled with He; negative temperature coefficient. Power: 190 MWI(t).
Two reactors to be used in tandem. Use of moderator in core expected to
lower fuel requirements. Using tubes instead of annulus for fuel expected
to eliminate unpredictable and possibly unfavorable flow and heat-transfer
characteristics of the original Fireball core. A cylindrical rather than
spherical core should simplify structural and fabrication problems.

uranium salt in molten fluorides, possibly LiF - or BeF-based. Moderator:

ZrHy. Coolant: Li’. Core: fuel tubes and ZrH rods, clad with Mo. Cool-

ant flows parallel to tubes. In one de sign, the fuel flows down through tubes
in center, goes to a header, and returns through outer tubes. In alternative,
fuel flows down through inner tube and up through annulus formed by enclos-
ing inner tube with an outer one. Li’ coolant could flow directly to an engine

No. 31 Stationary Fluoride Fuel, Sodium Cooled,
Reflector-moderated Reactor

Walter Kidde Nuclear Laboratories, Inc.

Reference: WKNL-42.

Originators: Staff members.

Status: Design for evaluation, 1955. Project discontinued, 1957.

Details: Similar to H. K. Ferguson concept in Data Sheet No. 6. Therrnal
neutrons, steady state, burner. Fuel: either U?% or U?* in molten KF-
NaF-ZrF,-UF, mixture (4 mol % UF,). Stationary fuel is in tubes. Using
U”* instead of U?® increases coolant volume and reduces fuel required,
but increases average heat flux excessively. Increasing U?* concentration
to 27.5 mol % also would increase fuel volume, but because of decreased
thermal conductivity would require more than three times as many fuelele-
ments, 68,400 instead of 20,400. Supporting so many with parallel flow of
coolant would be very difficult. Coolant: Na. Difficulties: difficult heat
removal because of poor thermal conductivity of the molten salts; because
tubes must be small to avoid excessive internal temperatures, many tubes
are required.

ORSORT

Reference: CF-53-9-84.

Originators: J. H. MacMillan et al..
Status: Preliminary design study for feasibility; ORSORT term paper, 1953.

Details: Modification of Fireball. Thermal and intermediate neutrons,

steady state, burner. Fuel: molten mixture of 50 mol % NaF, 47 mol %

ZrF,, and 3 mol % enriched UF,. Moderator: circulating molten NaOD.

Coolant: NaK. Reflector: spherical Be shell, 11 in. thick, 2 in. OD.
Structure: spherical, with Be shell, pressure shell, and helical fuel tubes

in annular form. Inconel structural material; clad with nickel where in con-
“tact with NaOD. Helical tubes used to reduce uncertainties of unstable flow

in reactors of high power density. Fuel enters core at north pole and flows
downward through six 3.5 in. ID Inconel tubes. Five tubes are wrapped in a
variable-pitch helix to form a spherical annulus of fuel. Sixth passes through
center of sphere, forming smaller-diameter helix. In returning, fuel flows
over primary NaK-cooled heat exchanger. NaK coolant in circumferential
heat exchanger, spherical shell. Fuel and coolant flow countercurrently.
NaOD, which cools reflector, flows downward through spherical cavity in
reflector and surrounds fuel tubes; acts as moderator "island." Returns to
top through holes in reflector, through spherical cavity outside reflector,

through a shell-and-tube heat exchanger and back to core. NaOD cooled in

exchanger by exchange with NaK that is returning to reactor. NaK then goes
to primary heat exchanger to cool fuel. Control system needed to keep temp-
erature of returning NaOD constant to prevent corrosion from over-heating or
freezing from cooling. Heat-exchange system uses only one intermediate
heat-transfer medium and eliminates need for additional radiators to cool
part of NaK, as proposed for Fireball. Control: negative temperature coef-

ficient; shim control--adding enriched fuel; variable by-pass in xenon sepa-

rator would add xenon to provide fine adjustment in reactivity between
additions of enriched fuel. No rods. Basically, power extracted is deter-
mined solely by demand of propulsion system. Power: 200 MW(t).

Chapter 3. Two-region Reactors

 

In the development of practical molten-salt-fueled reactors, two-
region reactors represent a more advanced stage of development than
one-region reactors. A two-region power breeder is the goal. Work on
two-region MSR's has been nearly all concentrated at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory. Most reactors described in this chapter have graphite-
moderated cores and fluoride fuels, although two concepts utilize chloride
fuels and no moderator.

In 1960, MacPherson described three possible types of reactor
construction for breeding.’

The first, the unit fuel tube, was believed to be the most practical.
The fuel passes through the reactor in graphite tubes, which are enclosed
by graphite moderator. The blanket, which contains a thorium salt, sur-
rounds the core. The blanket salt also passes through small passages in
the graphite as a coolant.

The graphite core shell consists of three blocks of graphite--a top
header, a center section, and a bottom header. The blocks should be of
graphite that is nearly impervious to the fuel solution. The three blocks
are either clamped, cemented, or held together by posts.

In the internally cooled reactor, the fuel is in graphite tubes ex-
tending through the moderator into the blanket. The tubes are connected
at each end to a header system, so that the fuel can be slowly circulated
to keep it uniform, to remove gaseous fission products, and to allow for
the fuel concentration to be adjusted for burnup. The heat is transferred
through the tube wall to the blanket salt, which thus acts as a coolant.
Graphite inserts in the tubes force the fuel to the outer portion of tubes
to increase heat transfer. A problem with this structure is that it is un-
likely that all of the 10,000 tubes needed for a 200 MW(e) reactor would
keep their integrity for a long reactor lifetime.

Hydroxide-moderated Reactor

 

In considering hydroxide-moderated two-region reactors, Dayton
and Chastain emphasized lithium-7 hydroxide and lithium-7 deuteroxide.?

~ The spherical reactor, consisting of concentric shells of zirconium, has an

outer annulus, which contains a suspension of thorium oxide in heavy water.
This suspension serves both as a breeding blanket and as a reflector. The
specified core temperature of 1100°F was assumed to be high enough for
efficient power production but low enough to avoid excessive corrosion.
Breeding gains greater than 0.2 were postulated for reactors with either
lithium compound. The authors concluded that the reactor moderated with
 

54

Li’OD would be preferable. The reactor moderated with Li’OH has a lower-
cost moderator, smaller core radius, and smaller fuel requirements. These
advantages, however, are more than offset by those of the reactor moderated
with Li’OD. This reactor, because of its larger core radius, would offer a
larger breeding gain and would have improved heat-removal properties.
Also, although more fuel is required, it is a much smaller percentage of

the total mass than is required with the reactor moderated with Li’OH.

MIT Fast Reactor

A reactor designed in early 1952 that differed from most two-region
reactors was the MIT Fluid Fuel Fused-salt Reactor reported by Goodman
et al, 4 Instead of fluorides, the fuel is uranium tetrachloride, which is
dissolved in a molten mixture of lead chloride and sodium chloride. The
higher thermal neutron-absorption cross section of the chlorides requires
this to be designed as a fast reactor. The blanket consists of uranium
tetrachloride containing depleted uranium. A lead reflector around the
semispherical core is used for shim control.

ORSORT Fast Breeder

 

A similar design for a fast reactor was employed by Bulmer, et al.,
students at the Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology, in 1956.5 Again
the fuel salt was a chloride instead of a fluoride, with both plutonium and
depleted uranium chlorides dissolved in sodium and magnesium chlorides,
The depleted uranium permits internal breeding. The blanket, a paste of
depleted uranium oxide powder in sodium, is divided into two regions by
a graphite moderator, which makes possible a smaller blanket. A molten-
lead reflector is between the core and the blanket. A graphite reflector
surrounds the second blanket region. A power of 260 MW(e) was given.

Internally Cooled Molten-salt Reactor

 

Lackey calculated the nuclear characteristics for this reactor, which
uses molten fluorides of uranium, thorium, lithium, and beryllium as fuel.
The blanket and coolant are the molten-salt solutions without uranium. ®
Graphite is the moderator. Cylindrical passages for coolant are in a tri-
angular lattice within the graphite, with the fuel in the annular space be-
tween the coolant tube and the graphite. The fertile salt is in a blanket
around the graphite. A different core arrangement, to reduce doubling
time, would use two concentric tubes with fuel in. the annulus and coolant
flowing through the inner tube and outside the outer tube. This design was
for a reactor of high power--1563 MW(t).

Thermal Convection Reactor

 

Zasler has proposed a reactor,” for which few details are given,
in which circulation of fuel could be either by natural convection for a
5-MW experimental reactor, or by fuel pumps for a 50-MW(t) pilot plant.
In the spherical reactor, which is surrounded by a blanket, fuel flows
from the reactor to a shell-and-tube heat exchanger.

Molten Salt Reactor (MSR)

 

This ORNL concept’ !! has been given many names: MSR; Interim
Design Reactor; Molten Fluoride Converter; Molten Fluoride Power Re-
actor; Reference Design Reactor; RDR; MSR Reference Design; and
Homogeneous, Two-region, Molten-~fluoride~salt Reactor. It underwent
several modifications, particularly in the core design. The fuel is highly
enriched uranium tetrafluoride in a eutectic of lithium, beryllium, and
thorium fluorides. Plutonium-239 has been suggested as an alternative
fuel.!> A fertile blanket of the same composition as the fuel salt but with-
out the uranium surrounds the fuel region. The core has the shape of an
inverted pear. The fuel enters the bottom of the reactor, passes to the
top, goes to the primary heat exchangers, and returns to the reactor. The
reactor, designed for central-station power, would produce 260 MW(e).

Two-region, Graphite-moderated, Molten-salt Breeder Reactor

 

Members of the MSR Project staff selected a typical design for
calculation of reactor performance.’ The core is a graphite shell struc-
ture with a single cylinder of graphite as the main part and two graphite
end pieces. The three pieces are held together by rods of INOR-8 or other
alloy. The fuel, uranium-233 in a molten fluoride carrier containing
thorium, passes downward through channels in the core then back upward
to an external heat exchanger. The blanket, which contains thorium in
molten salt, is kept at a slightly higher pressure than the core. The power
would be 125 MW(t).

Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR)

 

A reactor considered in 1961 in a comparison of homogeneous re-
actors for thorium breeding was the MSBR, 14,15 which was based on a
design by MacPherson in 1959.! In both the 1959 and 1961 designs, the
fuel is a solution of enriched uranium tetrafluoride in LiF-BeF,, the blan-
ket surrounding the core is molten salt containing thorium, and the fuel
passes through tubes in the graphite moderator. In the 1959 design, the
core is of the unit-fuel-tube construction, in which one-pass graphite tubes
go through the graphite moderator. In the 1961 design, the core is con-
structed of graphite prisms, machined at the corners to form vertical
 

56

passages, into which two-pass bayonet graphite tubes for fuel flow are
inserted. Both designs are for use in groups of reactors for power
production. The 1959 concept is for three reactors producing 333 MW(e)
each, the 1961 concept for two reactors producing 500 MW(e) each.

carrier salt with the blanket and coolant salts. This should reduce doubling
times. Further reduction possible by different core arrangement: 2 con-
centric tubes, with fuel in the annulus and coolant flowing through the inner

tube and on outside of outer tube.

No. 6 5 MW(50 MW) Thermal-convection Molten Salt Reactor
ORNL

 

References: ORNL-2551, pp. 49-51; ORNL-2626, p. 48.

Originator: J. Zasler.

Status: Proposal for preliminary design, 1958.

Details: Thermal neutrons, steady state, breeder. Spherical core, 5 ft
diameter, surrounded by 0.5 ft blanket. Fuel-coolant: flows at 158 gpm
through reactor and shell-and-tube heat exchanger, cooled by Na, entering
the heat exchanger at 1210°F and leaving at 1010°F. 5-MW(t) experimental
reactor could be converted to 50-MW(t) pilot plant by adding fuel pumps
(to increase flow to 1515 gpm) and increasing capacity of the fuel pumps.

- Status: Conceptual design, 1959; work continuing.

 

Details: Intermediate neutrons, steady state, converter. Fuel-coolant-
moderator: mixture of 90% enriched U?*¥®F, with LiF-BeF,-ThF,; alternate
fuel: Pu??? instead of U?*®. Neutrons with this fuel are thermal.
Fertile material: 2-ft-thick blanket, of ThF, as eutectic of LiF-BeF,-ThFy,
completely surrounding fuel region. Both fluids circulated to external shell-
and-tube heat exchangers, where heat is transferred to Na. Several core
configurations considered: 1) straight-through flow, 2) concentric inlet
(inner pipe)-outlet (outer annulus) flow, 3) concentric inlet (outer annulus)-
outlet (inner pipe) flow. Core: inverted-pear-shaped, Ni-Mo alloy, 8-ft in
diameter (6-ft in early designs), surmounted by expansion chamber con-
taining fuel pump. Fuel temperature: approximately 1200°F. Control: neg-
ative temperature coefficient. Blanket produces U233 at conversion ratio of
0.6 to 0.8, depending upon processing. Reactor designed as central-station
power plant to produce 600 MW(t), 260 MW(e).

No. 8 Two-region, Graphite-moderated Molten-salt Breeder Reactor

ORNL

 

Reference: ORNL-~2799,

Originators: MSR project staff.

Status: Typical design for calculation of performance, 1959.

Details: Thermal neutrons, steady state, breeder. Fuel-coolant: U233,

presumably as UF,, dissolved in molten LiF-BeF,-ThF,.

- Moderator: graphite. Reflector: graphite. Fertile material: 30-in.

blanket of 13 mol % Th in molten LiF-BeF,-ThF,. Core: main part
made from single cylinder of graphite, about 5 ft diameter, 5 ft long,

and two end pieces. Three pieces held together by rods of INOR-8 or
other alloy. Parallel vertical channels for fuel flow, 1/2 in. max. radius.
Molten fuel salt passes downward through core then back upward to ex-
ternal heat exchanger. Blanket, which surrounds core, is kept at slightly
higher pressure. Pressure: 1000 psi max. Control: presumably neg-
ative temperature coefficient. Power: 125 MW(t).

Status: Reference design for evaluation of thorium breeder reactors, 1961.
Details: Near-thermal neutrons, steady state, breeder. Fuel-coolant: UF,

in LiF and BeF,. Moderator: graphite. Fertile material: blanket of ThFy
in LiF and BeF,. Reflector: graphite. Core cylinder 74 ft x 7%- ft, of
graphite moderator prisms, 7.5 in. square by approx. 7 ft long. Corners
machined to form vertical passages of about 5 in. diameter circular cross-
section. Fuel flows through 90 2-pass bayonet graphite tubes inserted into
these vertical passages. Core surrounded on all sides by 3-ft blanket, which
is then surrounded by the 1-ft graphite reflector. Heat exchanger and fuel
pump mounted directly above the reactor. Maximum fuel temperature:
1300°F; minimum 1125°F. Operating pressure: 100 psi. Control: through
negative temperature coefficient. Power station would include 2 such re-
actors to produce 2364 MW(t) or 1000 MW(e)--1182 MW(t) and 500 MW(e)
each.
